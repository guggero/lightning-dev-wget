<PRE>Hi everyone,
as suggested by Lucas de C. Ferreira and Ryan Gentry, I submitted a PR for
a new bLIP for a common NFC payment flow that uses LNURL protocol -
specifically LNURL-withdraw sub-protocol - which I called
*LNURL-withdrawPOS*:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/16">https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/16</A>

Please note: this is NOT a new LNURL sub-protocol but an attempt to reach
an open and common standard for the receiving part of the flow (merchant
Point of Sale with NFC sensor).

*Abstract*

LNURL-withdraw is a bech32-encoded HTTPS query string or sub-protocol of
LNURL
which gives the users the ability to receive funds via Lightning Network
without the need of manually creating an invoice.
Users scan a QRcode or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet,
this queries a server and gets a JSON with some info, such as the max
amount the user can receive, the min amount the user can request, etc.
Then the wallet typically asks the user to enter an amount and under the
hood it creates a Lightning invoice and sends it to the service provider,
which eventually pays that.
So the only things the users have to do are:

1. Scan the QR code / paste the LNURL-withdraw link into the wallet
2. Enter the amount to receive
3. Confirm

In this repo I schematize a LNURL-withdraw flow for POS, which sees the
interaction between the user and a POS equipped with a NFC sensor.

This bLIP serves to document what could be a reference flow for open source
implementations of POS devices able to read LNURL-withdraw links via NFC,
for a better UX in Lightning payments powered by LNURL protocol.

*Reference Implementations*

There are solutions that already use this common flow or are going to
implement it.
I'm having calls to push the adoption of this open standard, in particular
I've been contacted by Danny Scott (Coincorner), Danny Brewster (Fast
Bitcoins), I'm gonna have a call with Kamil Brejcha (Dexfin Exchange) and
I'm open to discuss this with anyone who wants to have a call.

Fast Bitcoins's Point of Sale &lt;<A HREF="https://fastbitcoins.com/">https://fastbitcoins.com/</A>&gt;

I invite the representatives of the implementations to signal their support
to this flow by adding themselves to the table available here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LNURL-withdrawPOS">https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LNURL-withdrawPOS</A>
and to support this bLIP.

*Please note*: before adding your implementation to this list, be sure it
is:
open source, fully interoperable, respects the LNURL-withdraw specs (LUD03
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/03.md">https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/03.md</A>&gt;)

*Feel free to reach out*
As mentioned above, I'm open to discuss this even via call: simply select a
date from my calendar <A HREF="https://calendly.com/thedavidcoen">https://calendly.com/thedavidcoen</A>

Thanks for your time!
