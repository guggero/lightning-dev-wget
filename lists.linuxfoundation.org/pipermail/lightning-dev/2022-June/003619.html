&gt;&gt;<i> Rene Pickhardt brought up the issue of latency with regards to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not explicitly, but that strikes me as more of an implementation level
</I>&gt;<i> concern. As an example, today more nodes are starting to use replicated
</I>&gt;<i> database backends instead of a local ed embedded database. Using such a
</I>&gt;<i> database means that _network latency_ is now also a factor, as committing
</I>&gt;<i> new states requires round trips between the DBMS that'll increase the
</I>&gt;<i> perceived latency of payments in practice. The benefit ofc is better support
</I>&gt;<i> for backups/replication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think in the multi-signature setting for LN, system designers will also
</I>&gt;<i> need to factor in the added latency due to adding more signers into the mix.
</I>&gt;<i> Also any system that starts to break up the logical portions of a node
</I>&gt;<i> (signing, hosting, etc -- like Blockstream's Greenlight project), will need
</I>&gt;<i> to wrangle with this as well (such is the nature of distributed systems).
</I>
It is worth mentioning here that the LN protocol is generally not very
latency sensitive, and from my experience can easily handle very slow
signers (3-5 seconds delay) without causing too many issues, aside from
slower forwards in case we are talking about a routing node. I'd expect
routing node signers to be well below the 1 second mark, even when
implementing more complex signer logic, including MuSig2 or nested
FROST.

In particular remember that the LN protocol implements a batch
mechanism, with changes applied to the commitment transaction as a
batch. Not every change requires a commitment and thus a signature. This
means that while a slow signer may have an impact on payment latency, it
should generally not have an impact on throughput on the routing nodes.

Christian
