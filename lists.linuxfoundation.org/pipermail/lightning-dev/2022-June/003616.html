<PRE>Hi y'all,

This mail was inspired by this [1] spec PR from Lisa. At a high level, it
proposes the nodes add a delay between the time they see a channel closed on
chain, to when they remove it from their local channel graph. The motive
here is to give the gossip message that indicates a splice is in process,
&quot;enough&quot; time to propagate through the network. If a node can see this
message before/during the splicing operation, then they'll be able relate
the old and the new channels, meaning it's usable again by senders/receiver
_before_ the entire chain of transactions confirms on chain.

IMO, this sort of arbitrary delay (expressed in blocks) won't actually
address the issue in practice. The proposal suffers from the following
issues:

  1. 12 blocks is chosen arbitrarily. If for w/e reason an announcement
  takes longer than 2 hours to reach the &quot;economic majority&quot; of
  senders/receivers, then the channel won't be able to mask the splicing
  downtime.

  2. Gossip propagation delay and offline peers. These days most nodes
  throttle gossip pretty aggressively. As a result, a pair of nodes doing
  several in-flight splices (inputs become double spent or something, so
  they need to try a bunch) might end up being rate limited within the
  network, causing the splice update msg to be lost or delayed significantly
  (IIRC CLN resets these values after 24 hours). On top of that, if a peer
  is offline for too long (think mobile senders), then they may miss the
  update all together as most nodes don't do a full historical
  _channel_update_ dump anymore.

In order to resolve these issues, I think instead we need to rely on the
primary splicing signal being sourced from the chain itself. In other words,
if I see a channel close, and a closing transaction &quot;looks&quot; a certain way,
then I know it's a splice. This would be used in concert w/ any new gossip
messages, as the chain signal is a 100% foolproof way of letting an aware
peer know that a splice is actually happening (not a normal close). A chain
signal doesn't suffer from any of the gossip/time related issues above, as
the signal is revealed at the same time a peer learns of a channel
close/splice.

Assuming, we agree that a chain signal has some sort of role in the ultimate
plans for splicing, we'd need to decide on exactly _what_ such a signal
looks like. Off the top, a few options are:

  1. Stuff something in the annex. Works in theory, but not in practice, as
  bitcoind (being the dominant full node implementation on the p2p network,
  as well as what all the miners use) treats annexes as non-standard. Also
  the annex itself might have some fundamental issues that get in the way of
  its use all together [2].

  2. Re-use the anchors for this purpose. Anchor are nice as they allow for
  1st/2nd/3rd party CPFP. As a splice might have several inputs and outputs,
  both sides will want to make sure it gets confirmed in a timely manner.
  Ofc, RBF can be used here, but that requires both sides to be online to
  make adjustments. Pre-signing can work too, but the effectiveness
  (minimizing chain cost while expediting confirmation) would be dependent
  on the fee step size.

  In this case, we'd use a different multi-sig output (both sides can rotate
  keys if they want to), and then roll the anchors into this splicing
  transaction. Given that all nodes on the network know what the anchor size
  is (assuming feature bit understanding), they're able to realize that it's
  actually a splice, and they don't need to remove it from the channel graph
  (yet).

  3. Related to the above: just re-use the same multi-sig output. If nodes
  don't care all that much about rotating these keys, then they can just use
  the same output. This is trivially recognizable by nodes, as they already
  know the funding keys used, as they're in the channel_announcement.

  4. OP_RETURN (yeh, I had to list it). Self explanatory, push some bytes in
  an OP_RETURN and use that as the marker.

  5. Fiddle w/ the locktime+sequence somehow to make it identifiable to
  verifiers. This might run into some unintended interactions if the inputs
  provided have either relative or absolute lock times. There might also be
  some interaction w/ the main constructing for eltoo (uses the locktime).

Of all the options, I think #2 makes the most sense: we already use anchors
to be able to do fee bumping after-the-fact for closing transactions, so why
not inherit them here. They make the splicing transaction slightly larger,
so maybe #3 (or something else) is a better choice.

The design space for spicing is preeetty large, so I figure the most
productive route might be discussing isolated aspects of it at a time.
Personally, I'm not suuuper caught up w/ what the latest design drafts are
(aside from convos at the recent LN Dev Summit), but from my PoV, how to
communicate the splice to other peers has been an outstanding design
question.
