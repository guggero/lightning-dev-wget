<PRE>Hi Roasbeef,

This is over-design: if you fail to get reliable gossip, your routing
will suffer anyway.  Nothing new here.

And if you *know* you're missing gossip, you can simply delay onchain
closures for longer: since nodes should respect the old channel ids for
a while anyway.

Matt's proposal to simply defer treating onchain closes is elegant and
minimal.  We could go further and relax requirements to detect onchain
closes at all, and optionally add a perm close message.

Cheers,
Rusty.

&gt;<i> Hi y'all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This mail was inspired by this [1] spec PR from Lisa. At a high level, it
</I>&gt;<i> proposes the nodes add a delay between the time they see a channel closed on
</I>&gt;<i> chain, to when they remove it from their local channel graph. The motive
</I>&gt;<i> here is to give the gossip message that indicates a splice is in process,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;enough&quot; time to propagate through the network. If a node can see this
</I>&gt;<i> message before/during the splicing operation, then they'll be able relate
</I>&gt;<i> the old and the new channels, meaning it's usable again by senders/receiver
</I>&gt;<i> _before_ the entire chain of transactions confirms on chain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, this sort of arbitrary delay (expressed in blocks) won't actually
</I>&gt;<i> address the issue in practice. The proposal suffers from the following
</I>&gt;<i> issues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1. 12 blocks is chosen arbitrarily. If for w/e reason an announcement
</I>&gt;<i>   takes longer than 2 hours to reach the &quot;economic majority&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i>   senders/receivers, then the channel won't be able to mask the splicing
</I>&gt;<i>   downtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2. Gossip propagation delay and offline peers. These days most nodes
</I>&gt;<i>   throttle gossip pretty aggressively. As a result, a pair of nodes doing
</I>&gt;<i>   several in-flight splices (inputs become double spent or something, so
</I>&gt;<i>   they need to try a bunch) might end up being rate limited within the
</I>&gt;<i>   network, causing the splice update msg to be lost or delayed significantly
</I>&gt;<i>   (IIRC CLN resets these values after 24 hours). On top of that, if a peer
</I>&gt;<i>   is offline for too long (think mobile senders), then they may miss the
</I>&gt;<i>   update all together as most nodes don't do a full historical
</I>&gt;<i>   _channel_update_ dump anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to resolve these issues, I think instead we need to rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> primary splicing signal being sourced from the chain itself. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> if I see a channel close, and a closing transaction &quot;looks&quot; a certain way,
</I>&gt;<i> then I know it's a splice. This would be used in concert w/ any new gossip
</I>&gt;<i> messages, as the chain signal is a 100% foolproof way of letting an aware
</I>&gt;<i> peer know that a splice is actually happening (not a normal close). A chain
</I>&gt;<i> signal doesn't suffer from any of the gossip/time related issues above, as
</I>&gt;<i> the signal is revealed at the same time a peer learns of a channel
</I>&gt;<i> close/splice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming, we agree that a chain signal has some sort of role in the ultimate
</I>&gt;<i> plans for splicing, we'd need to decide on exactly _what_ such a signal
</I>&gt;<i> looks like. Off the top, a few options are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1. Stuff something in the annex. Works in theory, but not in practice, as
</I>&gt;<i>   bitcoind (being the dominant full node implementation on the p2p network,
</I>&gt;<i>   as well as what all the miners use) treats annexes as non-standard. Also
</I>&gt;<i>   the annex itself might have some fundamental issues that get in the way of
</I>&gt;<i>   its use all together [2].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2. Re-use the anchors for this purpose. Anchor are nice as they allow for
</I>&gt;<i>   1st/2nd/3rd party CPFP. As a splice might have several inputs and outputs,
</I>&gt;<i>   both sides will want to make sure it gets confirmed in a timely manner.
</I>&gt;<i>   Ofc, RBF can be used here, but that requires both sides to be online to
</I>&gt;<i>   make adjustments. Pre-signing can work too, but the effectiveness
</I>&gt;<i>   (minimizing chain cost while expediting confirmation) would be dependent
</I>&gt;<i>   on the fee step size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In this case, we'd use a different multi-sig output (both sides can rotate
</I>&gt;<i>   keys if they want to), and then roll the anchors into this splicing
</I>&gt;<i>   transaction. Given that all nodes on the network know what the anchor size
</I>&gt;<i>   is (assuming feature bit understanding), they're able to realize that it's
</I>&gt;<i>   actually a splice, and they don't need to remove it from the channel graph
</I>&gt;<i>   (yet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   3. Related to the above: just re-use the same multi-sig output. If nodes
</I>&gt;<i>   don't care all that much about rotating these keys, then they can just use
</I>&gt;<i>   the same output. This is trivially recognizable by nodes, as they already
</I>&gt;<i>   know the funding keys used, as they're in the channel_announcement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   4. OP_RETURN (yeh, I had to list it). Self explanatory, push some bytes in
</I>&gt;<i>   an OP_RETURN and use that as the marker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   5. Fiddle w/ the locktime+sequence somehow to make it identifiable to
</I>&gt;<i>   verifiers. This might run into some unintended interactions if the inputs
</I>&gt;<i>   provided have either relative or absolute lock times. There might also be
</I>&gt;<i>   some interaction w/ the main constructing for eltoo (uses the locktime).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of all the options, I think #2 makes the most sense: we already use anchors
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to do fee bumping after-the-fact for closing transactions, so why
</I>&gt;<i> not inherit them here. They make the splicing transaction slightly larger,
</I>&gt;<i> so maybe #3 (or something else) is a better choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The design space for spicing is preeetty large, so I figure the most
</I>&gt;<i> productive route might be discussing isolated aspects of it at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I'm not suuuper caught up w/ what the latest design drafts are
</I>&gt;<i> (aside from convos at the recent LN Dev Summit), but from my PoV, how to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate the splice to other peers has been an outstanding design
</I>&gt;<i> question.
