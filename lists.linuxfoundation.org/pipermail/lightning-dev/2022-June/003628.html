I think you misunderstand me completely.

The &quot;payment fails&quot; term here means that *all possible routes below the fee budget have failed*, i.e. a complete payment failure that will cause your `pay` command to error out with a frownie face.

In that case, the payer is unable to purchase the service or product.

The opportunity cost they lose is the lack of the service or product; they keep the value of the sats that did not get paid, but lose the value of the service or product they wanted to buy in the first place.

In that case, the payer loses the subjective difference in value between the service / product, and the sats they would have paid.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
