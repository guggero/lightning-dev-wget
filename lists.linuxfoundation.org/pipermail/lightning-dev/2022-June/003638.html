Absolutely agreed, and I wasn't trying to say that latency is not a
concern, I was merely pointing out that the protocol as is, is very
latency-tolerant. That doesn't mean that routers shouldn't strive to be
as fast as possible, but I think the MuSig schemes, executed over local
links, is unlikely to be problematic when considering overall network
latency that we have anyway.

For edge nodes it's rather nice to have relaxed timings, given that they
might be on slow or flaky connections, but routers are a completely
different category.
