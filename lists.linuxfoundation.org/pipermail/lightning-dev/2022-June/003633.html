<PRE>Adding a noticeable on-chain signal runs counter to the goal of the move
to taproot / gossip v2, which is to make lightning's onchain footprint
indistinguishable from
any other onchain usage.

I'm admittedly a bit confused as to why onchain signals are even being
seriously
 proposed. Aside from &quot;infallibility&quot;, is there another reason for
suggesting
we add an onchain detectable signal for this? Seems heavy handed imo, given
that the severity of a comms failure is pretty minimal (*potential* for
lost routing fees).

&gt;<i> So it appears you don't agree that the &quot;wait N blocks before you close
</I>your
channels&quot; isn't a fool proof solution? Why 12 blocks, why not 15? Or 144?

fwiw I seem to remember seeing that it takes  ~an hour for gossip to
propagate
(no link sorry). Given that, 2x an hour or 12 blocks is a reasonable first
estimate.
I trust we'll have time to tune this after we've had some real-world
experience with them.

Further, we can always add more robust signaling later, if lost routing
fees turns
out to be a huge issue.

Finally, worth noting that Alex Myer's minisketch project may well
help/improve gossip
reconciliation efficiency to the point where gossip reliability is less
of an issue.
