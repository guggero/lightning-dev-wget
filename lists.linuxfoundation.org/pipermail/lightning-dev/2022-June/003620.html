In general, and especially for &quot;edge nodes&quot;, yes, but if forwarding nodes start taking a full second 
to forward a payment, we probably need to start aggressively avoiding any such nodes - while I'd 
love for all forwarding nodes to take 30 seconds to forward to improve privacy, users ideally expect 
payments to complete in 100ms, with multiple payment retries in between.

This obviously probably isn't ever going to happen in lightning, but getting 95th percentile 
payments down to one second is probably a good goal, something that requires never having to retry 
payments and also having forwarding nodes not take more than, say, 150ms.

Of course I don't think we should ever introduce a timeout on the peer level - if your peer went 
away for a second and isn't responding quickly to channel updates it doesn't merit closing a 
channel, but its something we will eventually want to handle in route selection if it becomes more 
of an issue going forward.
