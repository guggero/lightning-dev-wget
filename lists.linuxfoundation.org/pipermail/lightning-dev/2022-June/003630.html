<PRE>Hi Rusty,

Thanks for the feedback!

&gt;<i> This is over-design: if you fail to get reliable gossip, your routing will
</I>&gt;<i> suffer anyway.  Nothing new here.
</I>
Idk, it's pretty simple: you're already watching for closes, so if a close
looks a certain way, it's a splice. When you see that, you can even take
note of the _new_ channel size (funds added/removed) and update your
pathfinding/blindedpaths/hophints accordingly.

If this is an over-designed solution, that I'd categorize _only_ waiting N
blocks as wishful thinking, given we have effectively no guarantees w.r.t
how long it'll take a message to propagate.

If by routing you mean a routing node then: no, a routing node doesn't even
really need the graph at all to do their job.

If by routing you mean a sender, then imo still no: you don't necessarily
need _all_ gossip, just the latest policies of the nodes you route most
frequently to. On top of that, since you can get the latest policy each time
you incur a routing failure, as you make payments, you'll get the latest
policies of the nodes you care about over time. Also consider that you might
fail to get &quot;reliable&quot; gossip, simply just due to your peer neighborhood
aggressively rate limiting gossip (they only allow 1 update a day for a
node, you updated your fee, oops, no splice msg for you).

So it appears you don't agree that the &quot;wait N blocks before you close your
channels&quot; isn't a fool proof solution? Why 12 blocks, why not 15? Or 144?

&gt;<i>From my PoV, the whole point of even signalling that a splice is on going,
</I>is for the sender's/receivers: they can continue to send/recv payments over
the channel while the splice is in process. It isn't that a node isn't
getting any gossip, it's that if the node fails to obtain the gossip message
within the N block period of time, then the channel has effectively closed
from their PoV, and it may be an hour+ until it's seen as a usable (new)
channel again.

If there isn't a 100% reliable way to signal that a splice is in progress,
then this disincentives its usage, as routers can lose out on potential fee
revenue, and sends/receivers may grow to favor only very long lived
channels. IMO _only_ having a gossip message simply isn't enough: there're
no real guarantees w.r.t _when_ all relevant parties will get your gossip
message. So why not give them a 100% reliable on chain signal that:
something is in progress here, stay tuned for the gossip message, whenever
you receive that.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi y'all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This mail was inspired by this [1] spec PR from Lisa. At a high level, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposes the nodes add a delay between the time they see a channel
</I>&gt;<i> closed on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chain, to when they remove it from their local channel graph. The motive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here is to give the gossip message that indicates a splice is in process,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;enough&quot; time to propagate through the network. If a node can see this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message before/during the splicing operation, then they'll be able relate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the old and the new channels, meaning it's usable again by
</I>&gt;<i> senders/receiver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _before_ the entire chain of transactions confirms on chain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMO, this sort of arbitrary delay (expressed in blocks) won't actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address the issue in practice. The proposal suffers from the following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   1. 12 blocks is chosen arbitrarily. If for w/e reason an announcement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   takes longer than 2 hours to reach the &quot;economic majority&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   senders/receivers, then the channel won't be able to mask the splicing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   downtime.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   2. Gossip propagation delay and offline peers. These days most nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   throttle gossip pretty aggressively. As a result, a pair of nodes doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   several in-flight splices (inputs become double spent or something, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   they need to try a bunch) might end up being rate limited within the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   network, causing the splice update msg to be lost or delayed
</I>&gt;<i> significantly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (IIRC CLN resets these values after 24 hours). On top of that, if a
</I>&gt;<i> peer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   is offline for too long (think mobile senders), then they may miss the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   update all together as most nodes don't do a full historical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   _channel_update_ dump anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to resolve these issues, I think instead we need to rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; primary splicing signal being sourced from the chain itself. In other
</I>&gt;<i> words,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if I see a channel close, and a closing transaction &quot;looks&quot; a certain
</I>&gt;<i> way,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then I know it's a splice. This would be used in concert w/ any new
</I>&gt;<i> gossip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages, as the chain signal is a 100% foolproof way of letting an aware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peer know that a splice is actually happening (not a normal close). A
</I>&gt;<i> chain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signal doesn't suffer from any of the gossip/time related issues above,
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the signal is revealed at the same time a peer learns of a channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; close/splice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Assuming, we agree that a chain signal has some sort of role in the
</I>&gt;<i> ultimate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plans for splicing, we'd need to decide on exactly _what_ such a signal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looks like. Off the top, a few options are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   1. Stuff something in the annex. Works in theory, but not in practice,
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   bitcoind (being the dominant full node implementation on the p2p
</I>&gt;<i> network,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   as well as what all the miners use) treats annexes as non-standard.
</I>&gt;<i> Also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the annex itself might have some fundamental issues that get in the
</I>&gt;<i> way of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   its use all together [2].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   2. Re-use the anchors for this purpose. Anchor are nice as they allow
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   1st/2nd/3rd party CPFP. As a splice might have several inputs and
</I>&gt;<i> outputs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   both sides will want to make sure it gets confirmed in a timely manner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Ofc, RBF can be used here, but that requires both sides to be online to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   make adjustments. Pre-signing can work too, but the effectiveness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (minimizing chain cost while expediting confirmation) would be
</I>&gt;<i> dependent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   on the fee step size.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   In this case, we'd use a different multi-sig output (both sides can
</I>&gt;<i> rotate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   keys if they want to), and then roll the anchors into this splicing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   transaction. Given that all nodes on the network know what the anchor
</I>&gt;<i> size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   is (assuming feature bit understanding), they're able to realize that
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   actually a splice, and they don't need to remove it from the channel
</I>&gt;<i> graph
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (yet).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   3. Related to the above: just re-use the same multi-sig output. If
</I>&gt;<i> nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   don't care all that much about rotating these keys, then they can just
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the same output. This is trivially recognizable by nodes, as they
</I>&gt;<i> already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   know the funding keys used, as they're in the channel_announcement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   4. OP_RETURN (yeh, I had to list it). Self explanatory, push some
</I>&gt;<i> bytes in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   an OP_RETURN and use that as the marker.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   5. Fiddle w/ the locktime+sequence somehow to make it identifiable to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   verifiers. This might run into some unintended interactions if the
</I>&gt;<i> inputs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   provided have either relative or absolute lock times. There might also
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   some interaction w/ the main constructing for eltoo (uses the
</I>&gt;<i> locktime).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of all the options, I think #2 makes the most sense: we already use
</I>&gt;<i> anchors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be able to do fee bumping after-the-fact for closing transactions, so
</I>&gt;<i> why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not inherit them here. They make the splicing transaction slightly
</I>&gt;<i> larger,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so maybe #3 (or something else) is a better choice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The design space for spicing is preeetty large, so I figure the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; productive route might be discussing isolated aspects of it at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I'm not suuuper caught up w/ what the latest design drafts
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (aside from convos at the recent LN Dev Summit), but from my PoV, how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communicate the splice to other peers has been an outstanding design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; question.
