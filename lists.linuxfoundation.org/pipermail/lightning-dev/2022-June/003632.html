&gt;<i> Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is over-design: if you fail to get reliable gossip, your routing will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suffer anyway.  Nothing new here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Idk, it's pretty simple: you're already watching for closes, so if a close
</I>&gt;<i> looks a certain way, it's a splice. When you see that, you can even take
</I>&gt;<i> note of the _new_ channel size (funds added/removed) and update your
</I>&gt;<i> pathfinding/blindedpaths/hophints accordingly.
</I>
Why spam the chain?

&gt;<i> If this is an over-designed solution, that I'd categorize _only_ waiting N
</I>&gt;<i> blocks as wishful thinking, given we have effectively no guarantees w.r.t
</I>&gt;<i> how long it'll take a message to propagate.
</I>
Sure, it's a simplification on &quot;wait 6 blocks plus 30 minutes&quot;.

&gt;<i> If by routing you mean a sender, then imo still no: you don't necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> need _all_ gossip, just the latest policies of the nodes you route most
</I>&gt;<i> frequently to. On top of that, since you can get the latest policy each time
</I>&gt;<i> you incur a routing failure, as you make payments, you'll get the latest
</I>&gt;<i> policies of the nodes you care about over time. Also consider that you might
</I>&gt;<i> fail to get &quot;reliable&quot; gossip, simply just due to your peer neighborhood
</I>&gt;<i> aggressively rate limiting gossip (they only allow 1 update a day for a
</I>&gt;<i> node, you updated your fee, oops, no splice msg for you).
</I>
There's no ratelimiting on new channel announcements?

&gt;<i> So it appears you don't agree that the &quot;wait N blocks before you close your
</I>&gt;<i> channels&quot; isn't a fool proof solution? Why 12 blocks, why not 15? Or 144?
</I>
Because it's simple.

&gt;&gt;<i>From my PoV, the whole point of even signalling that a splice is on going,
</I>&gt;<i> is for the sender's/receivers: they can continue to send/recv payments over
</I>&gt;<i> the channel while the splice is in process. It isn't that a node isn't
</I>&gt;<i> getting any gossip, it's that if the node fails to obtain the gossip message
</I>&gt;<i> within the N block period of time, then the channel has effectively closed
</I>&gt;<i> from their PoV, and it may be an hour+ until it's seen as a usable (new)
</I>&gt;<i> channel again.
</I>
Sure.  If you want to not forget channels at all on close, that works too.

&gt;<i> If there isn't a 100% reliable way to signal that a splice is in progress,
</I>&gt;<i> then this disincentives its usage, as routers can lose out on potential fee
</I>&gt;<i> revenue, and sends/receivers may grow to favor only very long lived
</I>&gt;<i> channels. IMO _only_ having a gossip message simply isn't enough: there're
</I>&gt;<i> no real guarantees w.r.t _when_ all relevant parties will get your gossip
</I>&gt;<i> message. So why not give them a 100% reliable on chain signal that:
</I>&gt;<i> something is in progress here, stay tuned for the gossip message, whenever
</I>&gt;<i> you receive that.
</I>
That's not 100% reliable at all.   How long to you want for the new
gossip?

Just treat every close as signalling &quot;stay tuned for the gossip
message&quot;.  That's reliable.  And simple.

Cheers,
Rusty.
