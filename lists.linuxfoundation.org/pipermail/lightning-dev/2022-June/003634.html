<PRE>Heya Laolu,

From my PoV, adding prepayments to onion messages is putting the cart before the horse a bit, think there's a good amount of recourse before resorting to that.

Seems there are two cases to address here:

1. People are trying to stream GoT over lightning

In this case, just rate limiting should disrupt their viewing experience such that it becomes unusable. Don&#8217;t think LN can be compared to Tor here because they explicitly want to support this case and we don&#8217;t.

2. An attacker is trying to flood the network with OMs

In this case, IMO LN also can&#8217;t be compared to Tor because you can limit your OMs to channel partners only, and this in itself provides a &#8220;proof of work&#8221; that an attacker can&#8217;t surmount without actually opening channels.

Another huge win of backpressure is that it only needs to happen in DoS situations, meaning it doesn&#8217;t have to impact users in the normal case.

Cheers &#8212;Val

&gt;<i> Hi t-bast,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Happy to see this finally written up! With this, we have two classes of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals for rate limiting onion messaging:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Back propagation based rate limiting as described here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Allowing nodes to express a per-message cost for their forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> services, which is described here [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still need to digest everything proposed here, but personally I'm more
</I>&gt;<i> optimistic about the 2nd category than the 1st.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One issue I see w/ the first category is that a single party can flood the
</I>&gt;<i> network and cause nodes to trigger their rate limits, which then affects the
</I>&gt;<i> usability of the onion messages for all other well-behaving parties. An
</I>&gt;<i> example, this might mean I can't fetch invoices, give up after a period of
</I>&gt;<i> time (how long?), then result to a direct connection (perceived payment
</I>&gt;<i> latency accumulated along the way).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the 2nd route, if an attacker floods the network, they need to directly
</I>&gt;<i> pay for the forwarding usage themselves, though they may also directly cause
</I>&gt;<i> nodes to adjust their forwarding rate accordingly. However in this case, the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker has incurred a concrete cost, and even if the rates rise, then
</I>&gt;<i> those that really need the service (notifying an LSP that a user is online
</I>&gt;<i> or w/e) can continue to pay that new rate. In other words, by _pricing_ the
</I>&gt;<i> resource utilization, demand preferences can be exchanged, leading to more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient long term resource allocation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> W.r.t this topic, one event that imo is worth pointing out is that a very
</I>&gt;<i> popular onion routing system, Tor, has been facing a severe DDoS attack that
</I>&gt;<i> has lasted weeks, and isn't yet fully resolved [2]. The on going flooding
</I>&gt;<i> attack on Tor has actually started to affect LN (iirc over half of all
</I>&gt;<i> public routing nodes w/ an advertised address are tor-only), and other
</I>&gt;<i> related systems like Umbrel that 100% rely on tor for networking traversal.
</I>&gt;<i> Funnily enough, Tor developers have actually suggested adding some PoW to
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to mitigate DDoS attacks [3]. In that same post they throw around
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of using anonymous tokens to allow nodes to give them to &quot;good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> clients, which is pretty similar to my lofty Forwarding Pass idea as relates
</I>&gt;<i> to onion messaging, and also general HTLC jamming mitigation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, we're not the first to attempt to tackle the problem of rate
</I>&gt;<i> limiting relayed message spam in an anonymous/pseudonymous network, and we
</I>&gt;<i> can probably learn a lot from what is and isn't working w.r.t how Tor
</I>&gt;<i> handles things. As you note near the end of your post, this might just be
</I>&gt;<i> the first avenue in a long line of research to best figure out how to handle
</I>&gt;<i> the spam concerns introduced by onion messaging. From my PoV, it still seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be an open question if the same network can be _both_ a reliable
</I>&gt;<i> micro-payment system _and_ also a reliable arbitrary message transport
</I>&gt;<i> layer. I guess only time will tell...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The `shared_secret_hash` field contains a BIP 340 tagged hash
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any reason to use the tagged hash here vs just a plain ol HMAC? Under the
</I>&gt;<i> hood, they have a pretty similar construction [4].

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> During the recent Oakland Dev Summit, some lightning engineers got together to discuss DoS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protection for onion messages. Rusty proposed a very simple rate-limiting scheme that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statistically propagates back to the correct sender, which we describe in details below.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can also read this in gist format if that works better for you [1].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nodes apply per-peer rate limits on _incoming_ onion messages that should be relayed (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> N/seconds with some burst tolerance). It is recommended to allow more onion messages from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peers with whom you have channels, for example 10/seconds when you have a channel and 1/second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you don't.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When relaying an onion message, nodes keep track of where it came from (by using the `node_id` of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the peer who sent that message). Nodes only need the last such `node_id` per outgoing connection,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which ensures the memory footprint is very small. Also, this data doesn't need to be persisted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's walk through an example to illustrate this mechanism:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Bob receives an onion message from Alice that should be relayed to Carol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * After relaying that message, Bob stores Alice's `node_id` in its per-connection state with Carol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Bob receives an onion message from Eve that should be relayed to Carol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * After relaying that message, Bob replaces Alice's `node_id` with Eve's `node_id` in its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per-connection state with Carol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Bob receives an onion message from Alice that should be relayed to Dave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * After relaying that message, Bob stores Alice's `node_id` in its per-connection state with Dave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We introduce a new message that will be sent when dropping an incoming onion message because it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reached rate limits:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. type: 515 (`onion_message_drop`)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. data:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * [`rate_limited`:`u8`]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    * [`shared_secret_hash`:`32*byte`]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whenever an incoming onion message reaches the rate limit, the receiver sends `onion_message_drop`
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the sender. The sender looks at its per-connection state to find where the message was coming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from and relays `onion_message_drop` to the last sender, halving their rate limits with that peer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the sender doesn't overflow the rate limit again, the receiver should double the rate limit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after 30 seconds, until it reaches the default rate limit again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The flow will look like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alice                      Bob                      Carol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |      onion_message      |                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |------------------------&gt;|                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |      onion_message      |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |------------------------&gt;|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |    onion_message_drop   |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |&lt;------------------------|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |    onion_message_drop   |                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |&lt;------------------------|                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The `shared_secret_hash` field contains a BIP 340 tagged hash of the Sphinx shared secret of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rate limiting peer (in the example above, Carol):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * `shared_secret_hash = SHA256(SHA256(&quot;onion_message_drop&quot;) || SHA256(&quot;onion_message_drop&quot;) || sphinx_shared_secret)`
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This value is known by the node that created the onion message: if `onion_message_drop` propagates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the way back to them, it lets them know which part of the route is congested, allowing them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to retry through a different path.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whenever there is some latency between nodes and many onion messages, `onion_message_drop` may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be relayed to the incorrect incoming peer (since we only store the `node_id` of the _last_ incoming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peer in our outgoing connection state). The following example highlights this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Eve                       Bob                      Carol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |      onion_message      |                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |------------------------&gt;|      onion_message      |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |      onion_message      |------------------------&gt;|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |------------------------&gt;|      onion_message      |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |      onion_message      |------------------------&gt;|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |------------------------&gt;|      onion_message      |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                             |------------------------&gt;|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alice                       |    onion_message_drop   |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |      onion_message      |                    +----|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |------------------------&gt;|      onion_message |    |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |--------------------|---&gt;|
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |                    |    |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |                    |    |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |                         |                    |    |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |    onion_message_drop   |&lt;-------------------+    |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   |&lt;------------------------|                         |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this example, Eve is spamming but `onion_message_drop` is propagated back to Alice instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, this scheme will _statistically_ penalize the right incoming peer (with a probability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depending on the volume of onion messages that the spamming peer is generating compared to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> volume of legitimate onion messages).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is an interesting research problem to find formulas for those probabilities to evaluate how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficient this will be against various types of spam. We hope researchers on this list will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in looking into it and will come up with a good model to evaluate that scheme.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To increase the accuracy of attributing `onion_message_drop`, more data could be stored in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future if it becomes necessary. We need more research to quantify how much accuracy would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gained by storing more data and making the protocol more complex.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
