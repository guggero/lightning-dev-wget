&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ### Inverting The Filter: Feerate Cards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Basically, a feerate card is a mapping between a probability-of-success range and a feerate.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * 76%-&gt;100%: 50ppm
</I>&gt;<i> The economic insight here is this:
</I>&gt;<i> * The payer wants to pay because it values a service / product more highly than the sats they are spending.
</I>
&gt;<i> * If payment fails, then the payer incurs an opportunity cost, as it is unable to utilize the difference in subjective value between the service / product and the sats being spent.
</I>
(If payment fails, the only opportunity cost they incur is that they
can't use the funds that they locked up for the payment. The opportunity
cost is usually considered to occur when the payment succeeds: at that
point you've lost the ability to use those funds for any other purpose)

&gt;<i>   * Thus, the subjective difference in value between the service / product being bought, and the sats to be paid, is the cost of payment failure.
</I>
If you couldn't successfully route the payment at any price, you never
had the opportunity to buy whatever the thing was.

&gt;<i> We can now use the left-hand side of the feerate card table, by multiplying `100% - middle_probability_of_success` (i.e. probability of failure) by the fee budget (i.e. cost of failure), and getting the cost-of-failure-for-this-entry.
</I>
I don't think that makes much sense; your expected gain if you just try
one option is:

 (1-p)*0 + p*cost*(benefit/cost - fee)
 
where p is the probability of success that corresponds with the fee.

I don't think you can do that calculation with a range; if I fix the
probabilities as:

  12.5%  -10ppm
  27.5%    1ppm
  62.5%    5ppm
  87.5%   50ppm

then that approach chooses:

  -10 ppm if the benefit/cost is in (-10ppm, 8.77ppm)
    5 ppm if the benefit/cost is in [8.77ppm, 162.52ppm)
   50 ppm if the benefit/cost is &gt;= 162.52ppm

so for that policy, one of those entries is already irrelevant.

But that just feels super unrealistic to me. If your benefit is 8ppm,
and you try at -10ppm, and that fails, why wouldn't you try again at
5ppm? That means the real calculation is:

   p1*(benefit/cost - fee1) 
   + (p2-p1)*(benefit/cost - fee2 - retry_delay)
   - (1-p2)*(2*retry_delay)

Which is:

   p2*(benefit/cost)
     - p1*fee1 - (p2-p1)*fee2
     - (2-p1-p2)*retry_delay

My feeling is that the retry_delay factor's going to dominate...

That's also only considering one hop; to get the entire path, you
need them all to succeed, giving an expected benefit (for a particular
combination of rate card entries) of:

  (p1*p2*p3*p4*p5)*cost*(benefit/cost - (fee1 + fee2 + fee3 + fee4 + fee5)

And (p1*..*p5) is going to be pretty small in most cases -- 5 hops at
87.5% each already gets you down to only a 51% total chance of success.
And there's an exponential explosion of combinations, if each of the
5 hops has 4 options on their rate card, that's up to 1024 different
options to be evaluated...

&gt;<i> We then evaluate the fee card by plugging this in to each entry of the feerate card, and picking which entry gives the lowest total fee.
</I>
I don't think that combines hops correctly. For example, if the rate
cards for hop1 and hop2 are both:

   10%  10ppm
  100%  92ppm

and your expected benefit/cost is 200ppm (so 100ppm per hop), then
treated individually you get:

   10%*(100ppm - 10ppm) = 9ppm  &lt;-- this one!
  100%*(100ppm - 92ppm) = 8ppm

but treated together, you get:

    1%*(200ppm -  20ppm) =  1.8ppm
   10%*(200ppm - 102ppm) =  9.8ppm (twice)
  100%*(200ppm - 184ppm) = 16ppm &lt;-- this one!

&gt;<i> This is then added as a fee in payment algorithms, thus translated down to &quot;just optimize for low fee&quot;.
</I>
You're not optimising for low fee though, you're optimising for
maximal expected value, assuming you can't retry. But you can retry,
and probably in reality also want to minimise the chance of failure up
to some threshold.

For example: if I buy a coffee with lightning every week day for a year,
that's 250 days, so maybe I'd like to choose a fee so that my payment
failure rate is &lt;0.4%, to avoid embarassment and holding up the queue.

&gt;<i> * Nodes utilizing wall strategies and doing lots of rebalancing put low limits on the fee budget of the rebalancing cost.
</I>&gt;<i>   * These nodes are willing to try lots of possible routes, hoping to nab the liquidity of a low-fee node on the cheap in order to resell it later.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Such nodes are fine with low probability of success.
</I>
Sure. But in that case, they don't care about delays, so why wouldn't they
just try the lowest fee rates all the time, no matter what their expected
value is? They can retry once an hour indefinitely, and eventually they
should get lucky, if the rate card's even remotely accurate. (Though
chances are they won't get -10ppm lucky for the entire path)

Finding out that you're paying 50ppm at the exact same time someone else
is &quot;paying&quot; -10ppm is likely to be really irritating, however economically
rational it might be argued to be too.

&gt;<i> Thus feerate cards may very well unify a fair amount of the concerns we have.
</I>
All in all, this just seems crazy to me. But hey, prove me wrong!

&gt;<i> &gt; (dV/V)/(dF/F) &lt; -1 (fee-elasticity of volume is in the elastic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; region)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (&lt;-1 == elastic == flow changes more than the fee does == drop the fee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rate; &gt;-1 == ineleastic == flow changes less than the fee does == raise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the fee rate; =-1 == unit elastic == you've found a locally optimal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fee rate)
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for the math!
</I>&gt;<i> I was going to heuristic it and cross my fingers but this is probably a better framework.
</I>
&quot;elasticity&quot; is a standard economics concept, that's just slightly too
complicated to be well known. Super great though, at least when you want
to start putting any numbers on your supply/demand graphs...

One place I think a fee rate card *could* be interesting is you were to
parameterise it by *time*: you might find after doing all this elasticity
analysis, that your optimal fee rate during the US business day is high,
but during night time it's substantially lower. Rather than broadcasting
gossip traffic twice daily to switch over, perhaps you could just publish
it once with a rate card, &quot;55ppm between 12:00UTC and 24:00UTC, 10ppm at
other times&quot;. Perhaps if you don't mind paying -10ppm to get your channel
rebalanced, you could advertise that for 20 minutes once a night, eg,
and just stop forwarding payments once you get to a 50:50 split, at least
until the 20 mins is over. I guess different fees on weekends, or cheap
tuesday could also be a thing, perhaps? 0 or 100% fees on the sabbath?

I think in general it will take time to work out if the change in traffic
justifies raising/lowering your feerate; so my guess is publishing a
schedule and keeping it the same for weeks is probably pretty fine,
and maybe also pretty bandwidth friendly for nodes.

A published schedule would also let price sensitive users actually plan
ahead, which could be nice...

Cheers,
aj
