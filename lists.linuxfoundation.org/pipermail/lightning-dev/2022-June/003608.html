<PRE>Hey Zman and list,

I don't think waxwing's proposal will help us for private gossip.
The rate-limiting it provides doesn't seem to be enough in our case.
The proposal rate-limits token issuance to once every N blocks where
N is the age of the utxo to which we prove ownership of. Once the token
is issued and verified, the attacker can spend that utxo, and after N
blocks he's able to get a new token with this new utxo.

That is a good enough rate-limit for some scenarios, but in our case
it means that every N blocks people are able to double the capacity
they advertise without actually having more funds.

We can probably borrow ideas from this proposal, but OTOH I don't
see how to apply it to lightning gossip, what we want isn't really rate
limiting, we want a stronger link between advertised capacity and
real on-chain capacity.

Cheers,
Bastien

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ## Lightning Gossip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; # Gossip V2: Now Or Later?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A proposal for the &quot;re-design the entire thing&quot; was floated in the past
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rusty [6]. It does away with the strict coupling of channels to channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; announcements, and instead moves them to the _node_ level. Each node
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then advertise the set of &quot;outputs&quot; they have control of, which would
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be mapped to the total capacity of a node, without requiring that these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outputs self identify themselves on-chain as Lightning Channels. This
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opens up the door to different, potentially more privacy preserving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proofs-of-channel-ownership (something something zkp).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> waxwing recently posted something interesting over in bitcoin-dev, which
</I>&gt;<i> seems to match the proof-of-channel-ownereship.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/51349418be08be22aa2b4b469e3be92f">https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/51349418be08be22aa2b4b469e3be92f</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I confess to not understanding the mathy bits but it seems to me, naively,
</I>&gt;<i> that the feature set waxwing points out match well with the issues we want
</I>&gt;<i> to have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * We want to rate-limit gossip somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> * We want to keep the mapping of UTXOs to channels private.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It requires a global network that cuts across all uses of the same
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism (similar to defiads, but more private --- basically this means
</I>&gt;<i> that it cannot be just Lightning which uses this mechanism, at least to
</I>&gt;<i> acquire tokens-to-broadcast-my-channels) to prevent a UTXO from being
</I>&gt;<i> reused across services, a property I believe is vital to the expected
</I>&gt;<i> spam-resistance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; # Friend-of-a-friend Balance Sharing &amp; Probing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A presentation was given on friend-of-a-friend balance sharing [16]. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high level idea is that if we share _some_ information within a local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; radius, then this gives the sender more information to choose a path
</I>&gt;<i> that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; potentially more reliable. The tradeoff here ofc is that nodes will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; giving away more information that can potentially be used to ascertain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payment flows. In an attempt to minimize the amount of information
</I>&gt;<i> shared,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the presenter proposed that just 2 bits of information be shared. Some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initial simulations showed that sharing local information actually
</I>&gt;<i> performed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better than sharing global information (?). Some were puzzled w.r.t how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's possible, but assuming the slides+methods are published others can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dig further into the model/parameter used to signal the inclusion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Arguably, information like this is already available via probing, so one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; line of thinking is something like: &quot;why not just share _some_ of it&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may actually lead to less internal failures? This is related to a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tension between probing as a tool to increase payment reliability and
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a tool to degrade privacy in the network. On the other hand, others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; argued that probing provides natural cover traffic, since they actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _are_ payments, though they may not be intended to succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the topic of channel probing, a sort of makeshift protocol was
</I>&gt;<i> devised to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make it harder in practice, sacrificing too much on the axis of payment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reliability. At a high level it proposes that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * nodes more diligently set both their max_htlc amount, as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; max_htlc_value_in_flight amount
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * a 50ms (or select other value) timer should be used when sending out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commitment signatures, independent of HTLC arrival
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * nodes leverage the max_htlc value to set a false ceiling on the max in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flight parameter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * for each HTLC sent/forwarded, select 2 other channels at random and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reduce the &quot;fake&quot; in-flight ceiling for a period of time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some more details still need to be worked out, but some felt that this
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kick start more research into this area, and also make balance mapping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _slightly_ more difficult. From afar, it may be the case that achieving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; balance privacy while also achieving acceptable levels of payment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reliability might be at odds with each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A point that was brought up is that nodes can lie about their capacity,
</I>&gt;<i> and there would be no way to counteract this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even given the above, it would be trivial for a lying node to randomly lie
</I>&gt;<i> about their `max_htlc` to still be noticed by nodes who try to filter out
</I>&gt;<i> nodes who do not update their `max_htlc`s.
</I>&gt;<i> (maximal lying is to always say 50% of your capacity is in `max_htlc`,
</I>&gt;<i> your node can lie by setting `max_htlc` from 35%-&gt;65%, you can coordinate
</I>&gt;<i> this with another lying peer node too by use of an odd message number to
</I>&gt;<i> set up the lying protocol so both of you can lie about the channel capacity
</I>&gt;<i> consistently)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think your best bet is really to utilize feerates, as lying with those
</I>&gt;<i> is expected to lead to economic loss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; # Node Fee Optimization &amp; Fee Rate Cards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Over the past few years, a common thread we've seen across successful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routing nodes is dynamic fee setting as a way to encourage/discourage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; traffic. A routing nodes can utilize the set of fees of a channel to
</I>&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make it too expensive for other nodes to route through (it's already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; depleted don't try unless you'll give be 10 mil sats, which no one
</I>&gt;<i> would) or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very cheap, which'll incentivize flows in the other direction. If all
</I>&gt;<i> nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are constantly sending out updates of this nature, then it can generate a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of traffic, and also sort of leak more balance information overtime
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which some nodes are already doing: using fees/max_htlc to communicate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available balances).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One attendee proposed allowing nodes to express a sort of fee gradient
</I>&gt;<i> via a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; static curve/bucket/function, instead of dynamically communicating what
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; latest state of the fee+liquidity distribution looks like. A possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manifestation could be a series of buckets, each of which with varying
</I>&gt;<i> fee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rates. If your payment consumes 50% of channel balance, then you pay this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rate, otherwise if it's 5% you pay this rate, etc, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is not what was actually proposed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I understood it, the percent range is not how much the payment consumes
</I>&gt;<i> of the channel balance but instead the percent range is the
</I>&gt;<i> probability-of-success given a uniform distribution of channel balance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For instance if the current channel balance is currently 67%, then the
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding node will succeed all payments that pay a fee from the 33% fee
</I>&gt;<i> card or higher, otherwise fail the payment with &quot;not enough fees&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intent is that payers will treat 100% - fee_card_percent as the
</I>&gt;<i> probability-of-failure of that channel, and can select which fee card
</I>&gt;<i> maximizes both its probability-of-failure and max-fee in some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable exchange rate.
</I>&gt;<i>
