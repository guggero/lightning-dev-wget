<PRE>I've made a first attempt at projecting this idea onto the existing spec:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/843.">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/843.</A> This may also
clarify some of the questions that haven't been answered yet.

&gt;<i> Hi Joost,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for working on this and keeping raising awareness about channel
</I>&gt;<i> jamming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this post I'd like to present a variation of bidirectional upfront
</I>&gt;<i> payments that uses a time-proportional hold fee rate to address the
</I>&gt;<i> limitation above. I also tried to come up with a system that aims &gt; relate
</I>&gt;<i> the fees paid more directly to the actual costs incurred and thereby reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the number of parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not considering hold invoices and other long-term held packets was one of
</I>&gt;<i> my main concerns in the previous bidirectional upfront payments. This new
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hodl_fee_rate&quot; is better by binding the hold fee to the effectively
</I>&gt;<i> consumed timelocked period of the liquidity and not its potential maximum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, routing nodes might still include the risk of hitting the chain
</I>&gt;<i> in the computation of their `hodl_fee_rate` and the corresponding cost of
</I>&gt;<i> having onchain timelocked funds. Given that HTLC deltas are decreasing
</I>&gt;<i> along the path, it's more likely that `hodl_fee_rate` will be decreasing
</I>&gt;<i> along the path. Even in case of lawfully solved hodl HTLC, routing nodes
</I>&gt;<i> might be at loss for having paid a higher hold_fee on their upstream link
</I>&gt;<i> than received on the downstream one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is assuming increasing `hodl_fee_rate` along a payment path at odds with
</I>&gt;<i> the ordering of timelocks ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But this would also mean that anyone can send out an htlc and collect
</I>&gt;<i> hold fees unconditionally. Therefore routing nodes advertise on the network
</I>&gt;<i> their `hold_grace_period`. When routing nodes accept an htl&gt; to forward,
</I>&gt;<i> they're willing to pay hold fees for it. But only if they added a delay
</I>&gt;<i> greater than `hold_grace_period` for relaying the payment and its response.
</I>&gt;<i> If they relayed in a timely fashion, they exp&gt; ect the sender of the htlc
</I>&gt;<i> to cover those costs themselves. If the sender is also a routing node, the
</I>&gt;<i> sender should expect the node before them to cover it. Of course, routing
</I>&gt;<i> nodes can't be trusted. So in&gt; practice we can just as well assume that
</I>&gt;<i> they'll always try to claim from the prior node the maximum amount in
</I>&gt;<i> compensation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming `hodl_fee_rate` are near-similar along the payment path, you have
</I>&gt;<i> a concern when the HTLC settlement happens at period N on the outgoing link
</I>&gt;<i> and at period N+1 on the incoming link due to clock differences. In this
</I>&gt;<i> case, a routing node will pay a higher `hodl_fee_rate` than received.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is okay, that's an edge case, only leaking a few sats.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A more concerning one is when the HTLC settlement happens at period N on
</I>&gt;<i> the outgoing link and your incoming counterparty goes offline. According to
</I>&gt;<i> the HTLC relay contract, the `hodl_fee_rate` will be inflated until the
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty goes back online and thus the routing node is at loss. And
</I>&gt;<i> going offline is a really lawful behavior for mobile clients, even further
</I>&gt;<i> if you consider mailbox-style of HTLC delivery (e.g Lightning Rod). You
</I>&gt;<i> can't simply label such counterparty as malicious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I don't think counterparties can trust themselves about their onliness
</I>&gt;<i> to suspend the `hodl_fee_rate` inflation. Both sides have an interest to
</I>&gt;<i> equivocate, the HTLC sender to gain a higher fee, the HTLC relayer to save
</I>&gt;<i> the fee while having received one on the incoming link ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even though the proposal above is not fundamentally different from what
</I>&gt;<i> was known already, I do think that it adds the flexibility that we need to
</I>&gt;<i> not take a step back in terms of functionality (fair prici&gt; ng for hodl
</I>&gt;<i> invoices and its applications). Plus that it simplifies the parameter set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Minding the concerns raised above, I think this proposal is an improvement
</I>&gt;<i> and would merit a specification draft, at least to ease further reasoning
</I>&gt;<i> on its economic and security soundness. As a side-note, we're working
</I>&gt;<i> further on Stake Certificates, which I believe is better for long-term
</I>&gt;<i> network economics by not adding a new fee burden on payments. We should be
</I>&gt;<i> careful to not economically outlaw micropayments. If we think channel
</I>&gt;<i> jamming is concerning enough in the short-term, we can deploy a
</I>&gt;<i> bidirectional upfront payment-style of proposal now and consider a better
</I>&gt;<i> solution when it's technically mature.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi ZmnSCPxj,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not quite up-to-speed back into this, but, I believe an issue with using
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feerates rather than fixed fees is &quot;what happens if a channel is forced
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> onchain&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Suppose after C offers the HTLC to D, the C-D channel, for any reason,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is forced onchain, and the blockchain is bloated and the transaction
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> remains floating in mempools until very close to the timeout of C-D.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> C is now liable for a large time the payment is held, and because the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> C-D channel was dropped onchain, presumably any parameters of the HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (including penalties D owes to C) have gotten fixed at the time the channel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was dropped onchain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The simplicity of the fixed fee is that it bounds the amount of risk that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> C has in case its outgoing channel is dropped onchain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The risk is bound in both cases. If you want you can cap the variable fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at a level that isn't considered risky, but it will then not fully cover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the actual cost of the locked-up htlc. Also any anti-DoS fee could very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well turn out to be insignificant to the cost of closing and reopening a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel with the state of the mempool these days.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
