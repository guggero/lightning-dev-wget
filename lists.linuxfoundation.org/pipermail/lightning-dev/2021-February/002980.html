<PRE>Hey Christian,

Love this chain of thought! Back before I'd realized as ZmnSCPxj did that
we have a nice general NOT operation for a given point, I had a similar
thought on this thread
<A HREF="../2019-October/002213.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-October/002213.html</A>
where we eventually figured out that verifiable encryption kind of yields a
nice OR operation (where addition gives a nice AND).

I would like to note a couple of unsolved things/limitations on this front
though. The current NOT operation actually isn't composable meaning If I
have P_1 and P_2 we know how to construct !(P_1 AND P_2) but I don't
believe we know how to do (P_1 AND !P_2). This is because NOT P is
essentially an unconditional payment atomic with a reverse &quot;cancellation&quot;
payment using P as its payment point.

Looking more closely at ZmnSCPxj's proposal for escrow contracts which we
were previously thinking of as (Seller AND (Buyer OR Escrow)) I believe is
actually essentially just a payment to the Seller using the point !(Buyer
AND Escrow) as opposed to some actually compiled version of (Seller AND
(Buyer OR Escrow)).

All of this said, I think it would be super awesome if someone thought of a
way to construct some kind of negation operation which is composable in the
sense that we can do (A AND NOT B) and/or (A OR NOT B) or the like!

Best,
Nadav

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a set of payments in various directions and Barrier Escrows we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can enable some fairly complex use-cases..

</I>&gt;<i> This got me thinking about my first year logic course and functional

</I>&gt;<i> which you've already done in your prior mails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The resulting expressions may not be particularly nice, and result in a
</I>&gt;<i> multitude of payments going back and forth between the participants to
</I>&gt;<i> represent that logic, but it is possible. So the problem should now
</I>&gt;<i> simply be reduced to finding a minimal representation for a given
</I>&gt;<i> expression, which then minimizes the funds committed to a particular
</I>&gt;<i> instance of the expression.
