<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This struck me as an extremely salient point. One thing that has been
</I>&gt;<i> noticeable missing from these discussions is any sort of threat model or
</I>&gt;<i> attacker
</I>&gt;<i> profile. Given this is primarily a griefing attack, and the attacker
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> stand any direct gain, how high a fee is considered &quot;adequate&quot; deterrence
</I>&gt;<i> without also dramatically increasing the cost of node operation in the
</I>&gt;<i> average case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that the first instances that we'll see of this attack will be
executed by routing node operators that don't mind operating in a gray
area. Apparently the popularity of the Lightning Network has risen to the
point where it is possible for an operator to earn thousands of dollars per
month in routing fees. Imagine how much this could be when you're actively
jamming the competition's channels. Not only can you capture their traffic,
but it will also be possible to command a higher fee rate because senders
probably still want those payments to go through.
