<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,

Not quite up-to-speed back into this, but, I believe an issue with using
&gt;<i> feerates rather than fixed fees is &quot;what happens if a channel is forced
</I>&gt;<i> onchain&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose after C offers the HTLC to D, the C-D channel, for any reason, is
</I>&gt;<i> forced onchain, and the blockchain is bloated and the transaction remains
</I>&gt;<i> floating in mempools until very close to the timeout of C-D.
</I>&gt;<i> C is now liable for a large time the payment is held, and because the C-D
</I>&gt;<i> channel was dropped onchain, presumably any parameters of the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> (including penalties D owes to C) have gotten fixed at the time the channel
</I>&gt;<i> was dropped onchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The simplicity of the fixed fee is that it bounds the amount of risk that C
&gt;<i> has in case its outgoing channel is dropped onchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The risk is bound in both cases. If you want you can cap the variable fee
at a level that isn't considered risky, but it will then not fully cover
the actual cost of the locked-up htlc. Also any anti-DoS fee could very
well turn out to be insignificant to the cost of closing and reopening a
channel with the state of the mempool these days.
