I was re-reading this OP after seeing some of Rusty's concerns later in
the thread and I was wondering why we need to alter funding at all.
We're assuming that when Alice recovers from her backup, she knows her
node_id and has the private key necessary to sign messages for it, so
why can't she sign a message that gets gossiped across the network that
says, &quot;if you have a channel with node_id 0xa11ce, please close it now&quot;?

Maybe the message also includes a signed timestamp or block height so
only channels with funding transactions confirmed before that
time/height get closed, preventing future replays of the message from
closing Alice's later channels opened with the same seed/node_id.
