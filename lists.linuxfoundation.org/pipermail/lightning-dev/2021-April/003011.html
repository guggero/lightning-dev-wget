Somehow I missed this thread, but I did note in a previous meeting - these issues are great fodder for fuzzing. We&#8217;ve had a fuzzer which aggressively tests for precisely these types of message-non-delivery-and-resending production desync bugs for several years. When it initially landed it forced several rewrites of parts of the state machine, but quickly exhausted the bug fruit (though catches other classes of bugs occasionally as well). The state machine here is really not that big - while I agree simplifying it where possible is nice, ripping things out to replace them with fresh code (which would need similar testing) is probably not the most obvious decrease in complexity.

&gt;<i> I've been revisiting this because it makes things like splicing easier:
</I>&gt;<i> the current draft requires stopping changes while splicing is being
</I>&gt;<i> negotiated, which is not entirely trivial.  With the simplified method,
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have to wait at all.
</I>
Hmm, what&#8217;s nontrivial about this? How much more complicated is this than having an alternation to updates and pausing HTLC updates for a cycle or two while splicing is negotiated (I assume it would still need a similar requirement, as otherwise you have the same complexity)? We already have a similar update-stopping process for shutdown, though of course it doesn&#8217;t include restarting.
