</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Yes that's certainly a fine way to do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I was also thinking you could eliminate all &quot;basepoints&quot; (not just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pubkey) using something like this. i.e. just use the node pubkey as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;basepoint&quot; for everything and randomize it using the shared secret for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; each purpose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, I tried to spec this out, to implement it.  One issue is that you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now can't sign the commitment_tx (or htlc_tx) without knowing the node's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secret key (or, equivalently, knowing the tweaked key and being able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the derivation scheme to untweak it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using node secret key to sign the commitment_tx seems like something you
</I>&gt;<i> will have to accept to introduce this feature. For the idea to work it has
</I>&gt;<i> to be some public key that is known by others and gossiped through the
</I>&gt;<i> network. Of course you could extend the information that is gossiped about
</I>&gt;<i> a node to include a &quot;commit_tx_point&quot; but the nodeid seems the more natural
</I>&gt;<i> choice.
</I>
Duh, yes, of course you need the funding_key secret to sign the
commitment tx.

But you really don't want to access the `remote_pubkey` (which in a
modern option_static_remotekey world is simply the payment_basepoint).
It's generally considered good practice *not* to have this accessible to
your lightning node at all.

&gt;&gt;<i> c-lightning currently does a round-trip to the signing daemon for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already, but it'd be nice to avoid requiring it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I somewhat reluctantly added `commit_basepoint` from which the others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are derived: an implementation can use some hardened derivation from its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privkey (e.g. SHA256(node_privkey || ss || counter)) to create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this in a deterministic but still private manner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or we could just leave all the other points in and just replace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding_pubkey.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another approach is to do things in &quot;soft-fork&quot; like manner.
</I>&gt;<i> Each node that wants to offer this feature sets their funding_pubkey to a
</I>&gt;<i> specified DH tweak of the nodeid. Nodes that want backup-free channel
</I>&gt;<i> recovery can just refuse to carry on the funding protocol if the
</I>&gt;<i> funding_pubkey is not set the way it wanted.
</I>
Yeah, you can totally do this in an opt-in manner, except it doesn't
work unless your peer does it too.  Since we expect everyone to want to
do this, it's clearer to force everyone to calculate this and not have
redundant and confusing fields in the message.

&gt;&gt;<i>From my pruisit crypto point of view having only one public key is nice but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how it impacts things architecturally and other protocols like
</I>&gt;<i> watchtowers.
</I>
They can operate exactly like the existing scheme, AFAICT.

Here's the spec diff (based on dual-funding, since it's easier to simply
hard change).  Please check my EC math! :)

@@ -985,6 +995,31 @@ Funding composition for channel establishment v2 makes use of the
 [Interactive Transaction Construction](#interactive-transaction-construction)
 protocol, with the following additional caveats.
 
+#### Point Derivation
+
+The `funding_pubkey` and basepoints are derived from the two
+`node_id`s and the higher of the two `generation` values; the
+`payment_basepoint` is supplied directly.
+
+Derivation is done as follows:
+
+1. Start with two node ids, `N1` and `N2` (`N1` is the lesser of the
+   two SEC1-encoded compressed public keys, `N2` the greater).
+2. Derive a shared secret, `SS`, using ECDH on `N1` and `N2`.
+3. Define tweaks `T` for each peer, using `SHA256(SS || generation || node_id || name)`, where:
+   1. `generation` is the `u64` larger of the two `generation` fields from `open_channel2` and `accept_channel2`.
+   2. `node_id` is the SEC1-encoded compressed public key of the peer.
+   3. `name` is a non-terminated ASCII string, e.g. `htlc` is the four bytes
+   `0x68 0x74 0x6C 0x63`
+4. The `funding_pubkey` is defined as the `node_id` + G*T(`funding`).
+5. The `delayed_payment_basepoint` is defined as `node_id` + G*T(`delayed_payment`).
+6. The `htlc_basepoint` is defined as the `node_id` + G*T(`htlc`).
+
+If the secret for `payment_basepoint` is derived in a similar manner,
+it too can be easily recovered from just the `generation`, node key
+and peer `node_id`.  However, it may also point to an address for a
+completely separate system (e.g. cold storage), so it is specified
+explicitly in the protocol.
