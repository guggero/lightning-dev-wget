[ Following up on an old thread ]

After consideration, I prefer alternation.  It fits better with the
existing implementations, and it is more optimal than reflection for
optimized implementations.

In particular, you have a rule that says you can send updates and
commitment_signed when it's not your turn, and the leader either
responds with a &quot;giving way&quot; message, or ignores your changes and sends
its own.

A simple implementation *never* sends a commitment_signed until it
receives &quot;giving way&quot; so it doesn't have to deal with orphaned
commitments.  A more complex implementation sends opportunistically and
then has to remember that it's committed if it loses the race.  Such an
implementation is only slower than the current system if that race
happens.

I've been revisiting this because it makes things like splicing easier:
the current draft requires stopping changes while splicing is being
negotiated, which is not entirely trivial.  With the simplified method,
you don't have to wait at all.

Cheers,
Rusty.
