<PRE>OK, I'm now leaning *against* this method.

1. It removes the ability to update a channel without access to the node's
   secret key.  At the moment the node secret key is only needed for
   gossip and to DH to set up a new peer connection.  c-lightning does
   not use this for now (we keep the per-channel keys in the HSM too),
   but it would be a perfectly acceptable tradeoff not to do this.
2. It doesn't get rid of temporary_channel_id, since we don't know
   the generation_number until both sides have sent it.  We have a
   workaround for this already in dual-funding anyway.
3. Because we need a generation counter, it's not quite as easily
   scannable as you'd hope (the &quot;gap&quot; problem).

I think the &quot;encrypted blob served by peers&quot;, even in a very naive way,
offers another way to do this, though it requires the assumption that at
least one peer is honest.

Damn, because it was so clever!

Thoughts?
Rusty.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; clearly due for a change!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Yes that's certainly a fine way to do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I was also thinking you could eliminate all &quot;basepoints&quot; (not just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> funding
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pubkey) using something like this. i.e. just use the node pubkey as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;basepoint&quot; for everything and randomize it using the shared secret for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; each purpose.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OK, I tried to spec this out, to implement it.  One issue is that you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now can't sign the commitment_tx (or htlc_tx) without knowing the node's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> secret key (or, equivalently, knowing the tweaked key and being able to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use the derivation scheme to untweak it).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using node secret key to sign the commitment_tx seems like something you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will have to accept to introduce this feature. For the idea to work it has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be some public key that is known by others and gossiped through the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network. Of course you could extend the information that is gossiped about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a node to include a &quot;commit_tx_point&quot; but the nodeid seems the more natural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Duh, yes, of course you need the funding_key secret to sign the
</I>&gt;<i> commitment tx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you really don't want to access the `remote_pubkey` (which in a
</I>&gt;<i> modern option_static_remotekey world is simply the payment_basepoint).
</I>&gt;<i> It's generally considered good practice *not* to have this accessible to
</I>&gt;<i> your lightning node at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> c-lightning currently does a round-trip to the signing daemon for this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> already, but it'd be nice to avoid requiring it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I somewhat reluctantly added `commit_basepoint` from which the others
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are derived: an implementation can use some hardened derivation from its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> privkey (e.g. SHA256(node_privkey || ss || counter)) to create
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this in a deterministic but still private manner.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or we could just leave all the other points in and just replace
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> funding_pubkey.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another approach is to do things in &quot;soft-fork&quot; like manner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each node that wants to offer this feature sets their funding_pubkey to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified DH tweak of the nodeid. Nodes that want backup-free channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recovery can just refuse to carry on the funding protocol if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding_pubkey is not set the way it wanted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, you can totally do this in an opt-in manner, except it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work unless your peer does it too.  Since we expect everyone to want to
</I>&gt;<i> do this, it's clearer to force everyone to calculate this and not have
</I>&gt;<i> redundant and confusing fields in the message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>From my pruisit crypto point of view having only one public key is nice but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure how it impacts things architecturally and other protocols like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watchtowers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They can operate exactly like the existing scheme, AFAICT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the spec diff (based on dual-funding, since it's easier to simply
</I>&gt;<i> hard change).  Please check my EC math! :)

</I>&gt;<i> +   2. `node_id` is the SEC1-encoded compressed public key of the peer.
</I>&gt;<i> +   3. `name` is a non-terminated ASCII string, e.g. `htlc` is the four bytes
