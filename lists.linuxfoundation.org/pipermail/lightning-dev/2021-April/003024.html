</I>
Compared to today, its a good chunk of additional state machine logic to enforce when a message can or can not be sent, 
and additional logic for when we can (or can not) flush any pending changes buffer(s).


&gt;<i> The only &quot;twist&quot; is that if it's your turn and you receive an update,
</I>&gt;<i> you can either reply with a &quot;yield&quot; message, or ignore it.
</I>
How do you handle the &quot;no changes to make&quot; case - do you send yields back and forth ever Nms all day long or is there 
some protocol by which you resolve it when both parties try to claim turn at once?


&gt;&gt;<i> Isn&#8217;t that pretty similar? Discard one splice proposal deterministically (ok that&#8217;s new) and the loser has to store their proposal in a holding cell for later (which they have to do in turn-based anyway). Logic to check if there&#8217;s unsettled things in RAA handling is pretty similar to turn-based, and logic to reject other messages is the same as shutdown handling today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, with the simplified protocol you can `update_splice` at any time
</I>&gt;<i> instead of your normal update, since both sides are already in sync.
</I>
Hmm, I'm somewhat failing to understand why its that different - you can only update_splice if its your turn, which is 
about exactly the same amount of additional logic to check turn conditions as just flag &quot;want to do splice&quot;. Either way 
you have the same pending splice buffer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - MUST use the higher of the two `funding_feerate_perkw` as the feerate for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   the splice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we like turn based, why not just deterministic throw out one slice? :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because while I am going to implement turn-based, I'm not sure if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> else is.  I guess we'll see?
</I>
My point was more that its similar in logic - if you throw out the splice deterministically and just keep it in some 
&quot;pending slice&quot; buffer on the sending side, you've just done basically what you'd do to implement turns, while keeping 
the non-turn slice protocol a bit easier :).
