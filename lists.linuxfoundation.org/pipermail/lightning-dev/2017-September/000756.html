<PRE>Johan,

&quot; I suspect that if you keep every node within 3 hops in your local
topology&quot;

Not every node would store 3 hops. Maybe for some nodes 2 hops is the right
number. Or if you're connected directly with a huge hub, maybe you would
only be able to store your direct connections and the 2nd hops for only
*some* of your connections. Or maybe the algorithm could aim for a certain
amount of topology data for each connection (eg 10MB per connection) so
that you'll only store a small percentage of 2nd hops for a large hub,
while still be able to store 5th or 6th hops for long chains of nodes with
few connections.

</I>&gt;<i> I haven&#8217;t looked too closely at your proposal, but the first thing that

</I>&gt;<i> of the basic flood-the-network-about-channels algorithm that currently is
</I>&gt;<i> being used, this makes each route discovery request behave more or less

</I>&gt;<i> Also it will be interesting to see when the network starts developing, I

</I>&gt;<i> That being said, interesting idea, I&#8217;m not dismissing it :D

</I>&gt;<i> Hey Guys,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm testing this mailing list out for the first time, so I'm probably

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to talk about route discovery and route generation in the lightning
</I>&gt;<i> network. It seems there's a couple types of things going on with routing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Super basic flood-the-network style routing to get things up and
</I>&gt;<i>    running, as I believe is implicitly proposed here: <A HREF="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</A>

</I>&gt;<i>    - More involved research projects that may not reach fruition any time
</I>&gt;<i>    soon. Eg this: <A HREF="http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/">http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    whitepaper_flare_an_approach_to_routing_in_lightning_
</I>&gt;<i>    network_7_7_2016.pdf
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;<A HREF="http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/whitepaper_flare_an_approach_to_routing_in_lightning_network_7_7_2016.pdf">http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/whitepaper_flare_an_approach_to_routing_in_lightning_network_7_7_2016.pdf</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to discuss a near-term approach that can replace the basic
</I>&gt;<i> flood-the-network style route discovery, but isn't so complicated that it
</I>&gt;<i> needs a ton of study and work. This won't be the end-all solution to route
</I>&gt;<i> discovery, but should take us a lot further than flood-the-network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I propose a protocol where each node knows about its own local network
</I>&gt;<i> topology, and to find a final route, a transaction originator queries a
</I>&gt;<i> number of its connections for routes to the intended destination. By doing
</I>&gt;<i> this, it means that nodes are *not* receiving or storing the entire network
</I>&gt;<i> topology, which makes route discovery a lot less taxing on the network (in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of bandwidth and storage space).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To go into more detail...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a node joins the network:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. it broadcasts its information to all its channels (pretty much as
</I>&gt;<i> proposed here
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md</A>&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> announcing its relevant channel information
</I>&gt;<i> 2. it requests local network topology information from all its channels
</I>&gt;<i> for information about channels 1 hop beyond its direct connection (ie it
</I>&gt;<i> will receive information about which addresses those channels are connected
</I>&gt;<i> to, and their related fee info / etc)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. it then requests topology information for channels 2 hops beyond, etc
</I>&gt;<i> until it has filled its cache to its satisfaction (the user can choose some
</I>&gt;<i> amount of megabytes as its limit of network topology data to store)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. it also subscribes to topology changes for nodes at those distances (eg
</I>&gt;<i> if a node has requested information from 3 hops away, it will receive info
</I>&gt;<i> about any new channels or removed channels that fall within that distance)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a node receives an announcement message from a node joining the
</I>&gt;<i> network:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. it will store that node's info in its cache
</I>&gt;<i> 2. it will also forward that info to any node that's subscribed to
</I>&gt;<i> topology changes that fall within the relevant distance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a node wants to construct a route for a transaction:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It checks to see if it has a path to that node in its cache. If it
</I>&gt;<i> does, it finds the cost of the cheapest path it has.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It asks all the channels on the edge of its cached local view for their
</I>&gt;<i> cheapest path (however you want to define cheapest), specifying that it
</I>&gt;<i> only care about paths with a maximum cost of the cheapest path it has
</I>&gt;<i> already found in its cache. For example, if the node has nodes up to 3 hops
</I>&gt;<i> away in its cache, it will *only* ask the nodes 3 hops away (it will not
</I>&gt;<i> ask its direct connections, nor nodes 2 hops away, since it already has
</I>&gt;<i> enough information to ignore them)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. When it gets all its responses, it constructs a path
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a node receives a path request from a node:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It checks its cache for its cheapest cache-only path
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It asks nodes on the edge of its cached local view for their cheapest
</I>&gt;<i> path, specifying that it only cares about paths with a maximum cost of
</I>&gt;<i> either its cheapest cache-only path or the max-cost specified by the
</I>&gt;<i> requesting node minus the channel cost between it and the requesting node
</I>&gt;<i> (whichever is cheaper). A node on the edge of its cached local view is
</I>&gt;<i> *not* asked for route information if the cost to that node exceeds the
</I>&gt;<i> max-cost this relay node would specify.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. It reports the results that satisfy the max-cost requirements of the
</I>&gt;<i> requesting node
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that's it. All the route information can be encrypted and signed so
</I>&gt;<i> relaying nodes can't read the information inside, and so the requesting
</I>&gt;<i> source node can verify which nodes sent that information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This protocol should keep both node-announcement messages *and* route
</I>&gt;<i> request messages highly localized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
