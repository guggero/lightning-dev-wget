</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the clarification on this. So, basically, donations with

</I>&gt;<i> (static/reused) addresses because they can't be re-used? If so, that's

</I>
Yes, lightning is an interactive protocol, whereas bitcoin on-chain
isn't.  As you point out, that leads to problems...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It seems like this could definitely be a problem for lower value
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> products that are delivered slowly over long periods of time, such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> water, natural gas, electricity, internet, a parking meter, or some kind
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of digital content.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, it's only during the actualy payment.  Which looks like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   A: Hi B, I'll pay you $1 for preimage of hash X.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   B: Hi C, I'll pay you $0.99 for preimage of hash X.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   C: Hi D, I'll pay you $0.98 for preimage of hash X.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   D: Thanks C, here's the preimage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   C: Thanks B, here's the preimage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   B: Thanks A, here's the preimage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, if B or C go down after receiving the offer but before either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failing or returning the preimage, A has to wait, unsure if they'll try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to redeem the offer or not.  (If B or C are simply offline, A or B
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply fail and A gets to try again on a different route).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any security holes where B or C can receive the offer, but 
</I>&gt;<i> pretend they don't and then the payment gets re-routed some other way?
</I>
No; if I've sent the committed offer, I have to assume you can redeem
it.  Technically we send in batches (offer, offer ... commit) and
c-lightning uses a 10 msec timer so there's a chance to get a failure
before we send the commit.

&gt;<i> Any way for a party to have multiple hosts for redundancy, like how you 
</I>&gt;<i> can have multiple MX and NS records in DNS?
</I>
More than possible, but it requires multinode realtime failover, which I
don't think anyone has implemented yet...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> node re-uses the same public key?)? It seems like rather than putting a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> flag in BOLT 11 to instruct a payer to include a refund payment request,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't the payer just know to do that if they think they will need
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to? Or maybe they won't always?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nobody along the route (B and C in our example above) can see it.  And D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of has to, since it needs to send the refund.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me like this is sort of a limitation in privacy with 
</I>&gt;<i> lightening. With blockchain payments on my fuel pump, I could return a 
</I>&gt;<i> refund back to the customer without always knowing who they are. With 
</I>&gt;<i> lightning, it looks like the payer will reveal their identity to the 
</I>&gt;<i> payee by offering a refund payment request. It's great that those along 
</I>&gt;<i> the payment route don't know, but it's still bad to have the payer 
</I>&gt;<i> revealed to the payee. Why does someone have to reveal their identity 
</I>&gt;<i> just to get a refund?
</I>
Indeed, it's deeply suboptimal for privacy.

There's a more complex scheme which is possible, using round-trip
payments (I think this was originally from Christian Decker?); I make a
payment via you and back to myself, it's just that I pay your node an
abnormally high &quot;fee&quot;.  But unfortunately for security reasons each
encrypted hop contains the amount it expects to be sent, which doesn't
work if I don't know how much you're going to refund.

Technically, you can put a really small amount in there (each node only
insists that the amount sent is &gt;= this amount), but this just allows
one of those return nodes to untracably steal the extra refund amount.

So, we really need to be able to include a (smaller) return onion to
fix this properly.  I've added that to:
