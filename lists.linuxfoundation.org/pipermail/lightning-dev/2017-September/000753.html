<PRE>Hello,

Yes, it seems as though high frequency payments are not a reality. For 
high value products that are delivered quickly, &quot;micro&quot; payments are not 
even possible. With my fuel delivery system, the smallest volume of 
product that could be individually payed for would be on the order of a 
hundred mL. If I were to implement paying by the 100mL, is there any 
protocol for doing repeated payments? Do you have to request a new 
payment request, or can you just send more to the same payment request?

Regarding the payment route going down, if you can re-use the same 
payment request, when you say *during* a payment, do you mean when you 
are actually sending the payment (I think this is probably it), or 
everything related to that payment request (I don't think this is it)? 
It seems like this could definitely be a problem for lower value 
products that are delivered slowly over long periods of time, such as 
water, natural gas, electricity, internet, a parking meter, or some kind 
of digital content.

Regarding the refund address. Thanks for adding that to the issue 
requests. I guess I'm confused how this is going to work safely. If you 
put a refund request in with your payment, isn't that revealing the 
public key of your node and then defeating the whole purpose of the 
onion routing of the payment in the first place (I'm, assuming the payee 
node re-uses the same public key?)? It seems like rather than putting a 
flag in BOLT 11 to instruct a payer to include a refund payment request, 
shouldn't the payer just know to do that if they think they will need 
to? Or maybe they won't always?

In BOLT 11, how does a payee distinguish payments from different payers? 
In standard bitcoin transactions, this is usually by different bitcoin 
addresses that have been presented to different payers. Is this what the 
purpose of the d and h tagged fields are?

In BOLT 11, in the examples section, for the p tagged field, it lists it 
as a &quot;preimage&quot;. Is this supposed to be a &quot;preimage hash&quot;?

In BOLT 11, what's the point of tagged field n if the public key is 
implied through the signature and the required recovery id?

Thanks,

Andy Schroder

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then it's stuck, and you re-route a new payment.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, assuming that a real time micropayment is doable at the automobile

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficult with onion routing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With all that being said, even if real time micro payments can be a

</I>&gt;<i> I think the logical approach is a flag in BOLT 11 which says it wants a
