</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Such a dynamic algorithm would not know in the first place how many splits it will take, but it will know the total amount it intends to deliver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that would have worked because received takesmax of the values
</I>&gt;<i> received, ie, sender starts with A and B, both with &quot;numpieces=2&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> then splits B into BA and BB, both with &quot;numpieces=3&quot;.
</I>

Consider a network where there are 4 paths between payer and payee.

3 paths have low capacity but negligible feerate, while the 4th has high capacity but ridiculously high feerates measurable in whole microbitcoins.

The rational thing to try, when paying a somewhat large amount but trying to minimize fees, would be to split among the three lowcost paths.

But what if 2 of those paths fail?
It would be better to merge them into a single payment along the expensive 4th path.
However, the remaining succeeding path has already given `numpaths`=3.

Using `numpaths` overcommits to what you will do in the future, and is unnecessary anyway.
The payee is interested in the total value, not the details of the split.


Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
