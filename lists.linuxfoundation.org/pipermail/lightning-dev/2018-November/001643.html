<PRE>I'm also starting to implement this, to see what I missed!

Original at <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/513">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/513</A>

Pasted here for your reading convenience:

- Option is sticky; it set at open time, it stays with channel
  - I didn't want to have to handle penalty txs on channels which switch
  - We could, however, upgrade on splice.
- Feerate is fixed at 253
  - `feerate_per_kw` is still in open /accept (just ignored): multifund may want it.
- closing tx negotiates *upwards* not *downwards*
  - Starting from base fee of commitment tx = 282 satoshi.
- to_remote output is always CSV delayed.
- pushme outputs are paid for by funder, but only exist if the matching
  to_local/remote output exists.
- After 10 blocks, they become anyone-can-spend (they need to see the
  to-local/remote witness script though).
- remotepubkey is not rotated.
- You must spend your pushme output; you may sweep for others.

 The reason for the separate transaction stage for HTLC outputs is so that HTLCs can timeout or be fulfilled even though they are within the `to_self_delay` delay.
 Otherwise, the required minimum timeout on HTLCs is lengthened by this delay, causing longer timeouts for HTLCs traversing the network.

 There exists a bias towards preferring mutual closes over unilateral closes,
 because outputs of the former are unencumbered by a delay and are directly
 spendable by wallets. In addition, mutual close fees tend to be less exaggerated
