Yes, I read this. What exactly is &quot;upselling&quot; in this context and how were
extra channel_updates in errors intended to be used for this? Is it useful
for non-strict forwarding nodes?


&gt;<i> AFAICT this is a deeply weird case.  If another channel had capacity you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good point. If the value is acceptable, but that particular channel happens
to have not enough balance, it is hard to explain why you wouldn't just
accept. Maybe if you have a large capacity channel that you want to reserve
for large amounts at a higher fee and you don't want this channel's balance
to be used up by multiple non-strict forwarded small htlcs? This could also
be realized by setting min_htlc, but then it can never be used for small
htlcs. This admittedly is pretty specific.

Maybe the forwarding hint that could make more of a difference is just the
information that non-strict forwarding was actually applied. Communicate
this as a node property via a global feature bit. If the sender receives a
TemporaryChannelFailure from a non-strict forwarding node, it doesn't need
to bother with trying all other (equal policy) channels from that node to
the next.

Regards,
Joost
