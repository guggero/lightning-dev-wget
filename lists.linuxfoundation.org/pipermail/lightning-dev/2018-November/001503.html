I disagree: you may not be in a position to freely close such channels
and remove your ability to transact with this party, similar to how you
may not be in a position to refuse to pay taxes. Also, since it is hard
to avoid (in the current situation) that some Lightning nodes have a
known link to legal entities like companies or persons, there are ways
outside the Lightning network to put pressure on node owners,
especially non-pseudonymous high-profile ones. This is, however, a non-
technical discussion; since we already agree on the desirability of the
feature, I suggest to keep it at this and focus on the technical
details.

&gt;<i> Nonetheless, I believe this feature is desirable, not for the above
</I>&gt;<i> scenario, but simply so that a payee is not required to maintain even
</I>&gt;<i> a pseudonym on the Lightning Network (the payee will still have to be
</I>&gt;<i> somehow contactable so it can generate an invoice somehow, but at
</I>&gt;<i> least it will not even have an identifiable pseudonym on-Lightning;
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it may have a pseudonym on some other network with better
</I>&gt;<i> privacy).&#160;&#160;If all its generated invoices use rendezvous routing, then
</I>&gt;<i> while it, obviously, must have a Lightning node somewhere, that node
</I>&gt;<i> is not easily identifiable among all Lightning nodes.
</I>
I guess that for most use cases a payee pseudonym is needed, unless
your use case is donating to random strangers. I only found one
exception: where the thing you pay for is cryptographically linked to
the Lightning payment (effectively, an atomic swap, like in a
Lightning-based decentralized exchange). In that case, a truly
anonymous (as opposed to pseudonymous) payee makes sense.

However, for use cases where the payee needs a pseudonym, it might
still be desirable to decouple that pseudonym from a location in the
Lightning network. Rendezvous routing can do that.

&gt;<i> Looking through BOLT 4, the text assumes inherently that source
</I>&gt;<i> routing is done, and even has a shared secret between hop and
</I>&gt;<i> source.&#160;&#160;However, it may be possible in rendezvous routing to simply
</I>&gt;<i> provide the blinding key (while hiding everything beyond the first
</I>&gt;<i> hop on the destination half of the route).
</I>
Sounds like it makes sense; I need to look into it.

&gt;<i> I also think that, as the destination is choosing the nodes on its
</I>&gt;<i> half of the route, that it should pay for fees, and thus the source
</I>&gt;<i> is only required to deliver the specified amount to the first hop
</I>&gt;<i> node of the destination half of the rendezvous route.
</I>
Agreed. The price agreed between payer and payee is the incoming amount
at the rendezvous point. In the &quot;original&quot; case that the payee-side
route is 0 hops long, the payee is the rendezvous point, and we're
equal to the original concept where the agreed-on price is the incoming
amount at the payee.
