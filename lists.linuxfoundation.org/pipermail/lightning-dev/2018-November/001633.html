&gt;<i> Dear Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not getting this proposal (maybe I am lacking some technical basic
</I>&gt;<i> understandings) however I decided to ask more questions in order to
</I>&gt;<i> complete my onboarding process faster and hope this is fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem starts with the fact that I can't find the term &quot;lightning probe
</I>&gt;<i> message&quot; in the current BOLTs  (actually the term probe only occures two
</I>&gt;<i> times and these seem unrelated to what you are talking about) so I am
</I>&gt;<i> confused what this is.
</I>
It would be a new message.  We don't have an equivalent at the moment,
though one was proposed for liveness testing of routes pre-payment:

        Use probing with short latency constraints (ex&#8221; must reply within 100 ms) to check that a route is usable before payment is actually sent
        <A HREF="../2018-October/001484.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-October/001484.html</A>

&gt;<i> As far as I understand your proposal from a high level the payer is
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to create an onion package which triggers the offering of HTLCs
</I>&gt;<i> with some additional metadata so that the receipient of the final onion can
</I>&gt;<i> answer with a BOLT11 invoice. What I don't get is the fact that a payment
</I>&gt;<i> hash needs to be known in order to offer HTLCs.
</I>
No, there's a new message, which looks like:

1. type: 260 (`fetch_invoice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`1366`:`onion_routing_packet`]

(The onion doesn't need some of the current fields, TBD).

&gt;<i> In general I was wondering (already during the summit) why we don't include
</I>&gt;<i> a connection oriented communication layer on top of the current protocol
</I>&gt;<i> which would allow payer and payee to communicate more efficiently about
</I>&gt;<i> payment and routing process and to negotiate stuff like spontaneos
</I>&gt;<i> payments.
</I>
This is HORNET; I recommend reading the paper.  I admit that this
message is the camel's nose in the tent, but we're building a payment
network, not a generalized communication network.  And until we figure
out how to pay-per-message without haemorrhaging privacy, we shouldn't
build such a thing.

&gt;<i> I see two reasons against this: 1.) more synchronous
</I>&gt;<i> communication makes stuff more complicated to implement and 2.) privacy
</I>&gt;<i> concerns.
</I>
3) Lack of incentives.  Nodes forward because they want a functioning
payment network, and they hope to be rewarded for it.  At the moment you
can get spammed quite badly and never get paid; I'd like to make that
more difficult, not bake it into the protocol!

Someone may build such a thing on top of lightning, but lightning nodes
are not generalized bandwidth providers.

&gt;<i> Am I missing something here? (and sorry for splitting the topic but I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't want to start a new one when it actually seems to fit to this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>
This is a can of worms I don't want to open for 1.1...

Cheers,
Rusty.
