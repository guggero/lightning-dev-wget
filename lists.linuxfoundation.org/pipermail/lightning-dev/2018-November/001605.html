<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,

Thanks for writing this up! I had started an email, but you beat me to it :)

&gt;<i> 1.  For a sequence of `type,len,value`, each `type` must be unique. --
</I>&gt;<i> accepted.
</I>
To add to this, it seemed that there was some agreement that repeated fields
should be serialized under a single root key, since a receiver can't know if a
field is allowed to have duplicates if they don't understand the field.

&gt;<i> For a sequence of `type,len,value`, the `type`s must be in ascending order
</I>&gt;<i> -- not explicitly accepted or rejected.  It would be easier to check
</I>&gt;<i> uniqueness &gt; (the previous rule we accepted) here for a naive parser (keep
</I>&gt;<i> track of some &quot;minimum allowed type&quot; that initializes at zero, check current
</I>&gt;<i> type &gt;= this, update to current type + 1) if `type`s are in ascending order.
</I>
Yep ascending makes sense to me, for the reasons you stated.

&gt;<i> 1, `type` - one byte or two?
</I>
I'd lean towards one, if a message has 256 optional fields, it might be time to
consider a new message type altogether.

&gt;<i> 3. `type` - does &quot;it's OK to be odd&quot; apply?  i.e. if an even `type` that is
</I>&gt;<i> not known is found, crash and burn.  But intent of this system is for future
</I>&gt;<i> expansion for optional fields, so...?
</I>
Perhaps this depends on context:
 - for gossip messages, I think the primary concern is not breaking signature
     validation, and that these would need to remain optional for backwards
     compatibility.
 - for link-level messages, we have a little more control. I imagined the fields
   would be gated by feature bit negotiation, and deviating from
   unsupported/required would result in being disconnected.

&gt;<i> 5. `len` - one byte or two? I believe we tend to use two bytes for various
</I>&gt;<i> lengths.
</I>
Maybe varint? One byte is not enough for all lengths, but two seems excessive
for uint8 or even uint32.

&gt;<i> 6.  BOLT - I propose making a separate BOLT for `type,len,value`, which other
</I>&gt;<i> messages and so on simply refer to.
</I>
Indeed, are you thinking we'd use this to add new fields proposed in 1.1?

In addition to the above, do we also want to flesh out what sub-TLV structures
would look like? Or perhaps that isn't necessary, if we can continue adding more
root-level keys.

</I>&gt;<i> Good morning list,

</I>&gt;<i> An item added discussed in the summit was the proposed &quot;type,len,value&quot;, which is added to the end of messages and other intercommunication structures (invoices and so on).
</I>&gt;<i> This would allow some transition to future additional fields while maintaining backward compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe these were brought up:

</I>&gt;<i> 1.  For a sequence of `type,len,value`, each `type` must be unique. -- accepted.

</I>&gt;<i> Now for bikeshedding:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1, `type` - one byte or two?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. `type` - maybe some other name, since we already use `type` for messages?  How about, `key` instead?

</I>&gt;<i> 4. `len` - measures bytes of `value`, obviously since if the receiver does not know the `type` then it cannot know what unit is used for the `value`.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. `len` - one byte or two? I believe we tend to use two bytes for various lengths.
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  BOLT - I propose making a separate BOLT for `type,len,value`, which other messages and so on simply refer to.
