<PRE>Hi, Margherita,

If you haven't already, look into &quot;data loss protection&quot; as defined in the
BOLTs. It is similar to to what you are suggesting, with A being able to
tell B that it lost state for the A&lt;-&gt;B channel, and if B is cooperative it
will help A recover its funds.

You can also look into watchtowers, and static and dynamic channel backups,
as they touch onto what you are describing.

Cheers,
Johan

&gt;<i> Good morning dev-lightning community,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last weekend, I had the opportunity to take part in &quot;LightningHackdayNYC&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It was an incredible event, thanks to all organizers, to all speakers and
</I>&gt;<i> all people available to share all own knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i> Discussing with the people of the community, I could define better the
</I>&gt;<i> problem that I'm focusing on and have some ideas for the solution.
</I>&gt;<i> I've created a project on GitHub:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/margheritafav/LightningNetworkProject">https://github.com/margheritafav/LightningNetworkProject</A> , where you
</I>&gt;<i> could find a draft of my research, and also you are welcome to add your
</I>&gt;<i> comments and feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To recap, the aim of the project is realizing a recovering protocol for
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning Network. As someone suggested me in the previous e-mails, Eltoo
</I>&gt;<i> is already solving this problem in part. With Eltoo, the nodes are able to
</I>&gt;<i> share the last status of the channel, so if one of the two nodes loses some
</I>&gt;<i> information, it can simply ask to the other node to share the most recent
</I>&gt;<i> status. Unfortunately, this mechanism doesn't include the case that the
</I>&gt;<i> other node doesn't share the last transaction, but instead an older one,
</I>&gt;<i> more favourable for own balance. My project aims to solve this particular
</I>&gt;<i> issue and make the protocol more solid to face completely the case of a
</I>&gt;<i> false positive node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Idea: The main idea of the design is using the other connected nodes as a
</I>&gt;<i> back-up of own recent status.
</I>&gt;<i> *I**f a node A is connected to a node B and a node C, for each
</I>&gt;<i> transaction between A and B, A sends an encrypted information, regarding
</I>&gt;<i> the last commitment transaction with B, to C. For each commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction with C, A sends an encrypted information, regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> last commitment transaction with C, to B.*
</I>&gt;<i> In this way, if A loses the last transactions, she may ask the information
</I>&gt;<i> to the other connected node and update the status.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this idea can solve the current lack in Eltoo and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> planning to analyze more this solution in the next days. Any
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts/suggestions are really appreciated to proceed in the wisest way
</I>&gt;<i> and find a solution that can also cover all your needs. If someone of you
</I>&gt;<i> is interested in this research, I'm available to share more details about
</I>&gt;<i> the design of my idea and I'm open to discussion. Moreover, if someone is
</I>&gt;<i> already working on this research topic, please not hesitate to write me for
</I>&gt;<i> possible collaborations to work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> Margherita Favaretto
