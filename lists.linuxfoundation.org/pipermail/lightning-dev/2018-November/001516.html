<PRE>I think it's true that most of my proposal can be achieved by writing
such things in human-readable form in the description field. Mostly,
the only thing my proposal does is to put things into a machine-
readable form; this may aid in automated processing and maybe a better
UI experience.

Maybe the least trivial thing is the inclusion of a payer pubkey in the
original invoice; this is the least trivial both in protocol complexity
and in potential benefits. One benefit is that it turns a &quot;proof-that-
someone-paid&quot; into a &quot;proof-that-I-paid&quot;; another benefit is that it
becomes clear who is authorized to issue another invoice that says
&quot;this original invoice is nullified&quot;.

Now that I think of it: my proposal has something important that yours
doesn't: the requirement to have *two* signatures (both payer and
payee) on each update. Without that requirement, there is one party who
can nullify the old contract by making a unilaterally signed invoice
and a self-generated payment preimage. Not even a need to do a payment
to self to &quot;fake&quot; a sort of a refund payment or so. This may be OK as
long as there is only one party who has obligations: then the other
party may partially or completely nullify those obligations, optionally
dependent on a payment. Requiring two signatures (and thereby
consensus) on each update is more generic though: it allows for
obligations on both parties.

Even more generic could be to allow more than two parties. I'm sure
there are complex business arrangements that have a need for this, but
I think we can always develop that later. Let's first tackle this
relatively simple case.

&gt;<i> Good morning CJP,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me, naively, that we can encode the description &quot;the

</I>&gt;<i> obligation to ensure that the obligation in the invoice whose hash is
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h&gt; is nullified&quot;, then we have revokable payments already.&#160;&#160;Such a
</I>&gt;<i> payment may itself be revoked, ad infinitum.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now, the only defined semantics of the description field in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BOLT11 is that it SHOULD be &quot;a complete description of the purpose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the payment&quot;. I think this is a bit vague; maybe this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deliberate?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, you may also think of a BOLT11 payment request as an option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract. If the payment is performed (which can be proven by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; showing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the preimage), then payee is bound to the terms and conditions in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; description. So, then the meaning of a description &quot;one cup of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coffee&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; becomes &quot;if payment happens, payee has an obligation to deliver one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of coffee&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A known issue is that payer is not identified in the contract, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not clear to who the payee has this obligation. As far as I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the only way to fix this is to have two-way communication, where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the payer sends some data to payee (e.g. public key), and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes the payment request, including this data. With this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; established,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we turn the preimage + payment request from a &quot;proof that someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paid&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into a &quot;proof that I paid&quot;, and therefore also a &quot;proof that payee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this obligation to me&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a bit afraid that such proofs are a bit too inflexible for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life applications. I think in real-life there are many cases where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to update / revoke agreements, even after payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One example is a full refund: if goods/services cannot be delivered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somehow, payer+payee might agree to a full refund instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delivery
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of goods/services. The refund is another payment, with a payment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; request made by the original payer; its contract should state that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original payee is no longer bound by the obligations in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another example is a partial refund, for instance if only a lower
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quantity or a lower quality of goods/services is delivered. This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another payment, but now the new contract replaces the old contract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifies a new, lower set of obligations for the original payee.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another example is a change of conditions without change of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for instance when a white/gold dress was ordered, but turned out to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unavailable, and payer finds a black/blue dress acceptable as well,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equal price. Then you'd just want to replace white/gold in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by black/blue, without any payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think nearly all cases (including ones not mentioned here) are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covered by a &quot;contract update&quot; format which includes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;the new obligations of the two parties to each other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;a secure hash of the previous contract version that is replaced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;this one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;optionally, a payment hash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;signatures from both parties
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contract update is considered valid if and only if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;the signatures correspond to the pubkeys in the original
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(the first in the chain)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;the signatures are valid signatures on this contract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;the previous contracts in the chain are all valid (except for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;invalidated by contract updates)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;there is no known valid contract that replaces this one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;if a payment hash is included, a corresponding payment preimage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;provided as well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The original contract is different in that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;It does not have a previous contract version (may be zeroed if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;want to keep the same format)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;A set of pubkeys is provided (one of payer, one of payee)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -&#160;&#160;&#160;Only payee has obligations, so payee never needs to receive a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;signature from payer. Payer needs to receive payee's signature,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;trivially add his own signature whenever needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whenever one payee has obligations to another, the pubkey of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;with obligations has to be verified through some PKI. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;to be outside the scope of this concept. Especially in the case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;one of the parties never has any obligations, that party may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use a new,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;non-PKI-verified pubkey for the transaction, as a temporary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pseudonym.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is some conceptual similarity between an updateable proof
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;payment and a payment channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A potential issue is that, theoretically, the &quot;contract update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chain&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;can fork. The simple solution is &quot;don't do that&quot;: either party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can stop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;it from happening by not signing the forking update.
