<PRE>Good morning CJP,

It seems to me, naively, that we can encode the description &quot;the obligation in the invoice whose hash is &lt;h&gt; is nullified&quot;, whose meaning then is promoted to &quot;if payment happens, payee has an obligation to ensure that the obligation in the invoice whose hash is &lt;h&gt; is nullified&quot;, then we have revokable payments already.  Such a payment may itself be revoked, ad infinitum.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj

&gt;<i> Right now, the only defined semantics of the description field in
</I>&gt;<i> BOLT11 is that it SHOULD be &quot;a complete description of the purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the payment&quot;. I think this is a bit vague; maybe this is deliberate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, you may also think of a BOLT11 payment request as an option
</I>&gt;<i> contract. If the payment is performed (which can be proven by showing
</I>&gt;<i> the preimage), then payee is bound to the terms and conditions in the
</I>&gt;<i> description. So, then the meaning of a description &quot;one cup of coffee&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> becomes &quot;if payment happens, payee has an obligation to deliver one cup
</I>&gt;<i> of coffee&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A known issue is that payer is not identified in the contract, so it is
</I>&gt;<i> not clear to who the payee has this obligation. As far as I can see,
</I>&gt;<i> the only way to fix this is to have two-way communication, where first
</I>&gt;<i> the payer sends some data to payee (e.g. public key), and then payee
</I>&gt;<i> makes the payment request, including this data. With this established,
</I>&gt;<i> we turn the preimage + payment request from a &quot;proof that someone paid&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> into a &quot;proof that I paid&quot;, and therefore also a &quot;proof that payee has
</I>&gt;<i> this obligation to me&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a bit afraid that such proofs are a bit too inflexible for real-
</I>&gt;<i> life applications. I think in real-life there are many cases where you
</I>&gt;<i> need to update / revoke agreements, even after payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One example is a full refund: if goods/services cannot be delivered
</I>&gt;<i> somehow, payer+payee might agree to a full refund instead of delivery
</I>&gt;<i> of goods/services. The refund is another payment, with a payment
</I>&gt;<i> request made by the original payer; its contract should state that the
</I>&gt;<i> original payee is no longer bound by the obligations in the original
</I>&gt;<i> contract.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another example is a partial refund, for instance if only a lower
</I>&gt;<i> quantity or a lower quality of goods/services is delivered. This is
</I>&gt;<i> another payment, but now the new contract replaces the old contract and
</I>&gt;<i> specifies a new, lower set of obligations for the original payee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another example is a change of conditions without change of payment,
</I>&gt;<i> for instance when a white/gold dress was ordered, but turned out to be
</I>&gt;<i> unavailable, and payer finds a black/blue dress acceptable as well, at
</I>&gt;<i> equal price. Then you'd just want to replace white/gold in the contract
</I>&gt;<i> by black/blue, without any payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think nearly all cases (including ones not mentioned here) are
</I>&gt;<i> covered by a &quot;contract update&quot; format which includes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   the new obligations of the two parties to each other
</I>&gt;<i> -   a secure hash of the previous contract version that is replaced by
</I>&gt;<i>     this one
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   optionally, a payment hash
</I>&gt;<i> -   signatures from both parties
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The contract update is considered valid if and only if
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   the signatures correspond to the pubkeys in the original contract
</I>&gt;<i>     (the first in the chain)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   the signatures are valid signatures on this contract
</I>&gt;<i> -   the previous contracts in the chain are all valid (except for being
</I>&gt;<i>     invalidated by contract updates)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   there is no known valid contract that replaces this one
</I>&gt;<i> -   if a payment hash is included, a corresponding payment preimage is
</I>&gt;<i>     provided as well
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The original contract is different in that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   It does not have a previous contract version (may be zeroed if you
</I>&gt;<i>     want to keep the same format)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   A set of pubkeys is provided (one of payer, one of payee)
</I>&gt;<i> -   Only payee has obligations, so payee never needs to receive a
</I>&gt;<i>     signature from payer. Payer needs to receive payee's signature, and can
</I>&gt;<i>     trivially add his own signature whenever needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Whenever one payee has obligations to another, the pubkey of the party
</I>&gt;<i>     with obligations has to be verified through some PKI. I consider this
</I>&gt;<i>     to be outside the scope of this concept. Especially in the case that
</I>&gt;<i>     one of the parties never has any obligations, that party may use a new,
</I>&gt;<i>     non-PKI-verified pubkey for the transaction, as a temporary pseudonym.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There is some conceptual similarity between an updateable proof of
</I>&gt;<i>     payment and a payment channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     A potential issue is that, theoretically, the &quot;contract update chain&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     can fork. The simple solution is &quot;don't do that&quot;: either party can stop
</I>&gt;<i>     it from happening by not signing the forking update.
