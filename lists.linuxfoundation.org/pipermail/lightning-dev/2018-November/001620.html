&gt;<i> Hi ZmnSCPxj,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for writing this up! I had started an email, but you beat me to it :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.  For a sequence of `type,len,value`, each `type` must be unique. --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accepted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To add to this, it seemed that there was some agreement that repeated fields
</I>&gt;<i> should be serialized under a single root key, since a receiver can't know if a
</I>&gt;<i> field is allowed to have duplicates if they don't understand the field.
</I>
If a receiver doesn't understand it, it doesn't have to enforce any
rules on it *at all*.  So it depends on individual cases.

&gt;&gt;<i> For a sequence of `type,len,value`, the `type`s must be in ascending order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- not explicitly accepted or rejected.  It would be easier to check
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uniqueness &gt; (the previous rule we accepted) here for a naive parser (keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> track of some &quot;minimum allowed type&quot; that initializes at zero, check current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type &gt;= this, update to current type + 1) if `type`s are in ascending order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep ascending makes sense to me, for the reasons you stated.
</I>
Again, writer MUST, with no constraint on reader.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1, `type` - one byte or two?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd lean towards one, if a message has 256 optional fields, it might be time to
</I>&gt;<i> consider a new message type altogether.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. `type` - does &quot;it's OK to be odd&quot; apply?  i.e. if an even `type` that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not known is found, crash and burn.  But intent of this system is for future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expansion for optional fields, so...?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this depends on context:
</I>&gt;<i>  - for gossip messages, I think the primary concern is not breaking signature
</I>&gt;<i>      validation, and that these would need to remain optional for backwards
</I>&gt;<i>      compatibility.
</I>
Yes, &quot;not OK&quot; is message dependent.  It doesn't break parsing (if you
want that, use a new message type), but it does break *usage*; &quot;you
can't use this information&quot;.

TLV makes sense when there are many many options, at cost of a couple of
bytes per option.  We agreed to consider it for new additions, but
sometimes a simple option bitmap will be a win.

&gt;<i>  - for link-level messages, we have a little more control. I imagined the fields
</I>&gt;<i>    would be gated by feature bit negotiation, and deviating from
</I>&gt;<i>    unsupported/required would result in being disconnected.
</I>
It's nice if you can simplify your code by always sending it, even if
the remote doesn't understand it.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5. `len` - one byte or two? I believe we tend to use two bytes for various
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lengths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe varint? One byte is not enough for all lengths, but two seems excessive
</I>&gt;<i> for uint8 or even uint32.
</I>
Yes, it's a nice compromise IMHO.

&gt;&gt;<i> 6.  BOLT - I propose making a separate BOLT for `type,len,value`, which other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages and so on simply refer to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, are you thinking we'd use this to add new fields proposed in 1.1?
</I>
Well, it's a very individual message thing.  We would specify it in
general, then each place where it's used (eg. gossip) would have their
own types.

&gt;<i> In addition to the above, do we also want to flesh out what sub-TLV structures
</I>&gt;<i> would look like? Or perhaps that isn't necessary, if we can continue adding more
</I>&gt;<i> root-level keys.
</I>
I think that the general TLV definition just belongs in BOLT #1, since
it's so short.

Cheers,
Rusty.
