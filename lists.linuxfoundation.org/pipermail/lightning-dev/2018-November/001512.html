&gt;<i> FWIW, I don't see reddit as a particularly viable &quot;court&quot;; there's
</I>&gt;<i> no way for reddit to tell who's actually right in a dispute, eg if I
</I>&gt;<i> say blockstream didn't send stickers I paid for, and blockstream says
</I>&gt;<i> they did; ie there's no need for a sock puppet in the above scenario,
</I>&gt;<i> blockstream can just say &quot;according to our records you signed for
</I>&gt;<i> delivery, stop whinging&quot;.
</I>
Well, in that case they can show a tracking number and Canada Post link?

We will eventually develop systems of arbitration better than &quot;whining
on reddit/twitter&quot;, but that's where bitcoin was in its early days, so I
use it as a useful starting point to think about receipts when we lack
an intermediary.

&gt;<i> I think there's maybe four sorts of &quot;proof of payment&quot; people might
</I>&gt;<i> desire:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   0) no proof: &quot;completely&quot; deniable payments (donations?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1) shared secret: ability to prove directly to the payee that an
</I>&gt;<i>      invoice was paid (what we have now)
</I>
We also, importantly, have the ability to tie the receipt to the
invoice.

&gt;<i>   2) signed payment: ability to prove to a different business unit of
</I>&gt;<i>      the payee that payment was made, so that you can keep all the 
</I>&gt;<i>      secrets in the payment-handling part, and have the service-delivery
</I>&gt;<i>      part not be at risk for losing all your money
</I>
Hmm, this requires auditing the current commitment transaction I think
(&quot;see, I'm holding the money!&quot;).  I have to think about this some
more...

&gt;<i>   3) third-party verifiable: so you can associate a payment with real
</I>&gt;<i>      world identity information, and take them to court (or reddit) as a
</I>&gt;<i>      contract dispute; needs PKI infrastructure so you can be confident
</I>&gt;<i>      the pubkey maps to the real world people you think it does, etc
</I>
Yes, we're still missing that last mile between the merchant and the
nodeid.  There's a proposal to do this with DNS records, there's the
LetsEncrypt-style &quot;serve this URL&quot;, but we also need something like
Certificate Transparency so I can reliably get old nodeids...

But the perfect is the enemy of the good, too.

Cheers,
Rusty.
