<PRE>Hi all,

I tried to simplify RBF as much as possible; it adds a *lot* of
complexity :( In particular, below we have one side pay the fees (and
thus responsible for RBF), in violation of the summit agreement,
and simplified the fee amount as much as reasonable.

RBF it implicitly requires multiple (exclusive) splices at once.  This
will all require a great deal of testing...

Changes since initial proposal:

1. We add subtypes so `splice_init`/`splice_accept` etc are single
   messages.  These basically allow us to describe variable numbers of
   variable-length fields.
2. We include both script and wscript in inputs, for p2sh-wrapping.
3. Initiator pays fees.
4. Other side gets to add the same number of inputs+outputs if they
   want, minimum 2 (enough for one input, one change output).
5. If we both initiate a splice at once, *fundee*'s tiebreaker (well,
   funder pays for everything else!).
6. Both sides give a max_extra_witness_len for inputs, to calc fee.
7. Every still-negotiable parameter is renegotiated.
8. We add RBF, at intiator's discretion (they're paying for it!)
9. The language &quot;MUST fail the channel&quot; has been made into &quot;MUST error&quot;
   in antipation of &quot;soft&quot; errors.

### Initiating a splice: `splice_init`

1. type: 40 (`splice_init`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`4`:`feerate_per_kw`]
   * [`2`:`num_inputs`]
   * [`num_inputs*splice_input`]
   * [`2`:`num_outputs`]
   * [`num_outputs`*splice_output`]
   * [`8`:`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`]
   * [`8`:`channel_reserve_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`htlc_minimum_msat`]
   * [`4`:`minimum_depth`]
   * [`2`:`to_self_delay`]

1. subtype: `splice_input`
2. data:
   * [`8`:`satoshis`]
   * [`32`:`prevtxid`]
   * [`4`:`prevtxoutnum`]
   * [`2`:`scriptlen`]
   * [`scriptlen`:`script`]
   * [`2`:`max_extra_witness_len`]
   * [`2`:`wscriptlen`]
   * [`wscriptlen`:`wscript`]

1. subtype: `splice_output`
2. data:
   * [`8`:`satoshis`]
   * [`2`:`scriptlen`]
   * [`scriptlen`:`script`]

The sender of `splice_init`:
  - if a splice is already in progress
    - MUST NOT send
  - MUST ensure each `splice_input` refers to an existing UTXO.
  - MUST ensure each `splice_output` is a standard script.
  - SHOULD ensure that `feerate_per_kw` is sufficient for the splice
    transaction to confirm.
  - MUST set `feerate_per_kw` to 253 or more.
  - MUST ensure it will have sufficient funds post-splice above its
    reserve to pay for the splice transaction at the given `feerate_per_kw`
    and the amount it contributes to the commitment_transaction fee
  - MUST NOT have total `splice_output` `satoshis` greater than its current
  balance minus reserve plus the total `splice_input` `satoshis`.
  - MUST set `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`,
  `channel_reserve_satoshis`, `htlc_minimum_msat`, `minimum_depth`,
  `to_self_delay` as specified in `accept_channel`.

NOTES:

1. Are we *sure* we don't want to make channel_reserve_satoshis 1% of
   capacity?  That would remove a parameter here.
2. We explicitly allow a null splice to reset parameters or throw away history.

The receiver of `splice_init`:
  - if it has also sent `splice_init`:
    - if the receiver was the original sender of `open_channel`:
      - MUST discard its own `splice_init`
    - otherwise:
      - MUST discard this `splice_init`.
  - if a splice is in progress:
    - MUST error.
  - if `feerate_per_kw` is less than 253:
    - SHOULD error.
  - if the total post-splice balance of the sender would be
    insufficient to meet its reserve plus the amount
    it contributes to the commitment_transaction fee:
    - MUST error.
  - if both nodes advertised the `option_upfront_shutdown_script`
  feature, and the receiving node received a non-zero-length
  `shutdown_scriptpubkey` in `open_channel` or `accept_channel`, and
  any splice_output that `shutdown_scriptpubkey` is not equal to `script`:
     - MUST fail the connection.
  - MUST respond to `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`,
  `channel_reserve_satoshis`, `htlc_minimum_msat`, `minimum_depth`,
  `to_self_delay` as specified in `accept_channel`.
  - SHOULD reply with `splice_accept`


### Accepting a splice: `splice_accept`

1. type: 41 (`splice_accept`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`2`:`num_inputs`]
   * [`num_inputs*splice_input`]
   * [`2`:`num_outputs`]
   * [`num_outputs`*splice_output`]
   * [`8`:`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`]
   * [`8`:`channel_reserve_satoshis`]
   * [`8`:`htlc_minimum_msat`]
   * [`4`:`minimum_depth`]
   * [`2`:`to_self_delay`]

The sender of `splice_accept`:
  - consider the `splice_limit` the total number of `splice_input` and
  `splice_output` from `splice_init`, with minimum 2.
  - MUST NOT send a number of `splice_input` and/or `splice_output`
  which exceeds `splice_limit`.
  - MUST ensure each `splice_input` refers to an existing UTXO.
  - MUST ensure each `splice_output` is a standard script.
  - MUST NOT have total `splice_output` `satoshis` greater than its current
  balance minus reserve plus the total `splice_input` `satoshis`.
  - MAY limit their `splice_input` and `splice_output`s to avoid
  sending the sender of `splice_init` below reserve.

The receiver of `splice_accept`:
  - If the number of `splice_input` and/or `splice_output` exceeds `splice_limit`:
     - MUST error.
  - if the total `splice_output` `satoshis` is greater than the
  sender's current balance minus reserve plus the total `splice_input`
  `satoshis`:
    - MUST error.
  - if both nodes advertised the `option_upfront_shutdown_script`
  feature, and the receiving node received a non-zero-length
  `shutdown_scriptpubkey` in `open_channel` or `accept_channel`, and
  any splice_output that `shutdown_scriptpubkey` is not equal to `script`:
     - MUST fail the connection.
  - SHOULD send `splice_commitment_signature`

Both sides:
  - MUST construct the resulting splice transaction as specified in &lt;FIXME&gt;

NOTES:

1. The receiver doesn't check transaction validity.  Worst-case, it'll
   never confirm, and never splice in.
2. We don't set size limits on inputs &amp; outputs, and we probably should?
3. The initiator can be forced below their reserve by the recipient
   adding their own splice in/outs.  But that's OK.

1. type: 42 (`splice_commitment_signature`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`64`:`commitment_signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_htlcs`]
   * [`num_htlcs*64`:`htlc_signature`]

The sender:
  - MUST set `commitment_signature` and `htlc_signature`s as done for
    `commitment_signed`, but spending the funding output of the splice
    transaction.

The recipient:
  - if `signature` is not valid for its local splice commitment transaction:
    - MUST fail the channel.
  - if `num_htlcs` is not equal to the number of HTLC outputs in the local
    splice commitment transaction:
    - MUST fail the channel.
  - if any `htlc_signature` is not valid for the corresponding HTLC transaction:
    - MUST fail the channel.
  - if the recipient was not the sender of `splice_init`:
    - SHOULD send its own `splice_commitment_signature` in return.
  - otherwise:
    - SHOULD send `splice_confirm`.

### Confirming a splice: `splice_confirm`

1. type: 43 (`splice_confirm`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`64`:`signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_witnesses`]
   * [`num_witnesses*witness_stack`]

Each `witness` itself is serialized witness input stack:
1. subtype: `witness_stack`
2. data:
   * [`2`:`num_input_stack`]
   * [`num_input_stack`*`stack_element`]

1. subtype: `stack_element`
2. data:
   * [`2`:`len`]
   * [`len`:`element`]

The sender:
  - MUST set `signature` to the signature for the splice transaction.
  - MUST set `witness` to the marshalled witness data for each of its
    inputs, in splice transaction order.
  - MUST remember the details of this splice transaction.
  - MUST NOT send a `witness_stack` whose length exceeds the
    corresponding `max_extra_witness_len`.

The recipient:
  - SHOULD check that 
  - SHOULD apply `signature` and `witness` to the splice transaction and
    broadcast the result.
  - If a `witness_stack` length exceeds the corresponding `max_extra_witness_len`:
    - MAY error.
  - if the recipient was the sender of `splice_init`:
    - SHOULD reply with its own `splice_confirm`.


### Updating a splice: `splice_rbf`

1. type: 45 (`splice_rbf`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`4`:`fee_step`]

Each `fee_step` adds 1/4 (rounded down) to the initial splice
transaction fee. eg. if the initial fee was 1035 satoshi, `fee_step` 1
is  1035 + 1035 / 4 = 1293, `fee_step` 2 is 1293 + 1293 / 4 = 1616.

The sender:
  - SHOULD send `splice_rbf` if the current splice transaction will not
    confirm in a timely manner.
  - MUST set `fee_step` greater than zero and greater than any prior `fee_step`.
  - MUST be the sender of `splice_init`.
  - MUST have already sent and received `splice_confirm` for the
    previous splice transaction.
  - MUST ensure it will have sufficient funds post-splice above its
    reserve to pay for the splice transaction at the new feerate.
  - MUST construct the resulting splice transaction as specified in &lt;FIXME&gt;
  - SHOULD send `splice_commitment_signature` on the new splice
    transation, and continue negotiation as before.    

The recipient:
  - if the sender of `splice_rbf` was not the sender of `splice_init`:
    - MUST error.
  - if the new fee exceeds the sender's current balance minus reserve
    after it is applied to the splice transaction:
    - MUST error.
  - MUST construct the resulting splice transaction as specified in &lt;FIXME&gt;
  - MUST handle `splice_commitment_signature` on the new splice
    transation, and continue negotiation as before.    
  
NOTES:

1. 1/4 is a reasonable minimal RBF, but as each one requires more
   tracking by the recipient, serves to limit the number you can create.

### Completing a splice: `splice_rbf`

1. type: 45 (`splice_closed`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`32`:`splice_txid`]


The sender:
  - MUST NOT send until the splice transaction has reached its own
  `minimum_depth`.
  - MUST set `splice_txid` to the txid of the splice transaction which confirmed.

Either node:
  - if it has received and sent `splice_rbf`:
    - MAY discard HTLCs and revocations requirements for states in
    channel prior to the splice.
  - MUST follow the requirements for `announcement_signatures` as if
    this were a new channel.

Message Changes During Splicing
-------------------------------
Once you've sent `splice_confirm` each commitment transaction is needs
to be duplicated for every splice transaction (thanks to RBF, there can
be multiple at once).  These are in rbf-received order (increasing fee
order, if initiator is spec compliant):

1. type: 39 (`closing_signed`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`fee_satoshis`]
   * [`64`:`signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_splice`] (`option_splice`)
   * [`num_splice*64`:`splice_signature`] (`option_splice`)

1. subtype: `splice_signatures`
2. data:
   * [`64`:`signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_htlcs`]
   * [`num_htlcs*64`:`htlc_signature`]

1. type: 132 (`commitment_signed`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`64`:`signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_htlcs`]
   * [`num_htlcs*64`:`htlc_signature`]
   * [`2`:`num_splice`] (`option_splice`)
   * [`num_splice*splice_signatures`] (`option_splice`)

If a reconnection occurs between between sending and receiving
`splice_confirm` or `splice_closed` the peer's status is uncertain.  This we
have a new field in `channel_reestablish` to flag that we consider ourselves
to be splicing:

1. type: 136 (`channel_reestablish`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`next_local_commitment_number`]
   * [`8`:`next_remote_revocation_number`]
   * [`32`:`your_last_per_commitment_secret`] (`option_data_loss_protect`)
   * [`33`:`my_current_per_commitment_point`] (`option_data_loss_protect`)
   * [`2`:`num_splice`] (`option_splice`)

The sender:
- MUST set `num_splice` to the number of `splice_confirm` it has received for
  the current splice operation, or 0 if no current splice operation.

The recipient:
- if `num_splice` is less than the number of `splice_confirm` it has sent for the current splice operation:
  - MUST re-transmit the last splice_confirm.
- if `num_splice` is more than the number of `splice_confirm` it has sent for the current splice operation:
  - MUST re-transmit the last splice_closed.

NOTES:

1. I suggest that the option_data_loss_protect fields MUST BE set here if
   option_splice (there's no reason not to AFAICT).  Or do we want to try TLV
   here?
