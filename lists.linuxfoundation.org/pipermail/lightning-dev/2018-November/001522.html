I don't follow...so it's a size issue? Or wanting to avoid &quot;repeated&quot;
fields?

Yeah that makes sense, forgetting the HTLC state is a big enough win in and
of itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Splice Signing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems that we're missing some fields here if we're to allow the
</I>splicing
&gt;&gt;<i> of inputs to be done in a non-blocking manner. We'll need to send two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revocation points for the new commitment: one to allow it to be created,
</I>and
&gt;&gt;<i> another to allow updates to proceed right after the signing is
</I>completed. In
&gt;&gt;<i> this case we'll also need to update both commitments in tandem until the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> splicing transaction has been sufficiently confirmed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think we can use the existing revocation points for both.
</I>
Yep, if we retain the existing shachain trees, then we just continue to
extend the leaves!

&gt;<i> We're basically co-generating a tx here, just like shutdown, except it's
</I>&gt;<i> funding a new replacement channel.  Do we want to CPFP this one too?
</I>
It'd be nice to be able to also anchor down this splicing transaction given
that we may only allow a single outstanding splicing operation to begin
with. Being able to CPFP it (and later on provide arbitrary fee inputs)
allows be to speed up the process if I want to queue another operation up
right afterwards.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Happy to get the splicing train rolling!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We've had increasing numbers of c-lightning users get upset they can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; open multiple channels, so I guess we're most motivated to allow
</I>&gt;<i> splicing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; existing channels
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Splicing isn't a substitute for allowing multiple channels. Multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channels allow nodes to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * create distinct channels with distinct acceptance policies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * create a mix of public and non-advertised channels with a node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * be able to send more than the (current) max HTLC amount
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     using various flavors of AMP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * get past the (current) max channel size value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * allow a link to carry more HTLCs (due to the current super low max
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     values) given the additional HTLC pressure that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     AMP may produce (alternative is a commitment fan out)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These all seem marginal to me.  I think if we start hitting max values,
</I>&gt;<i> we should discuss increasing them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a fundamental reason that CL will never allow nodes to create
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple channels? It seems unnecessarily limiting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, we have a daemon per peer.  It's really simple with 1 daemon, 1
</I>&gt;<i> channel.  My own fault: I was the one who insisted we mux multiple
</I>&gt;<i> connections over the same transport; if we'd gone for independent
</I>&gt;<i> connections our implementation would have been trivial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Splice Negotiation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any reason to now make the splicing_add_* messages allow one to add
</I>&gt;<i> several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inputs in a single message? Given &quot;acceptable&quot; constraints for how large
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; witness and pkScripts can be, we can easily enforce an upper limit on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of inputs/outputs to add.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mainly limitations of our descriptor language, TBH.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like that the intro messages have already been designed with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concurrent case in mind beyond a simpler propose/accept flow. However is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there any reason why it doesn't also allow either side to fully
</I>&gt;<i> re-negotiate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _all_ the funding details? Splicing is a good opportunity to garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the prior revocation state, and also free up obsolete space in watch
</I>&gt;<i> towers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about restarting the revocation sequence, but it seems like
</I>&gt;<i> that only saves a tiny amount since we only store log(N) entries.  We
</I>&gt;<i> can drop old HTLC info post-splice though, and (after some delay for
</I>&gt;<i> obscurity) tell watchtowers to drop old entries I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally, as the size of the channel is either expanding or
</I>&gt;<i> contracting,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both sides should be allowed to modify things like the CSV param,
</I>&gt;<i> reserve,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; max accepted htlc's, max htlc size, etc. Many of these parameters like
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CSV value should scale with the size of the channel, not allowing these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameters to be re-negotiated could result in odd scenarios like still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintain a 1 week CSV when the channel size has dipped from 1 BTC to 100k
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; satoshis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, good idea!  I missed that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Brings up a side point about these values, which deserves its own
</I>&gt;<i> post...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. type: 40 (`splice_add_input`) (`option_splice`)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to add nested p2sh inputs, we'll need to also expose the redeem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; script here, or add additional fields to allow sides to set a sig script
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well as witness during the signing phase.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - scriptpubkey is empty, or of form 'HASH160 &lt;20-byte-script-hash&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> EQUAL'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So no P2SH? :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another omission, yeah, we'd want that too I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    * [`4`:`feerate_per_kw`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What fee rate is this? IMO we should do commitmentv2 before splicing as
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we can more or less do away with the initiator distinction and have most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fees be ad hoc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're basically co-generating a tx here, just like shutdown, except it's
</I>&gt;<i> funding a new replacement channel.  Do we want to CPFP this one too?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Splice Signing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems that we're missing some fields here if we're to allow the
</I>&gt;<i> splicing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of inputs to be done in a non-blocking manner. We'll need to send two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; revocation points for the new commitment: one to allow it to be created,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another to allow updates to proceed right after the signing is
</I>&gt;<i> completed. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this case we'll also need to update both commitments in tandem until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splicing transaction has been sufficiently confirmed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can use the existing revocation points for both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, what about change addresses? Are they to be explicitly specified as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splice outs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They'd be splice-outs, yeah.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. type: 43 (`splice_commitment_signature`) (`option_splice`)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It may be worth pointing out there that we're able to transfer all
</I>&gt;<i> existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs over to the new commitment as additional context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I think people missed that it was non-blocking like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. type: 45 (`splice_witness`) (`option_splice`)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Should also allow either side to specify the sig script here if we're to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow nested p2sh (which we should IMO!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   * [`2`:`len`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   * [`len`:`witnesses`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is the extra length needed if all the witness elements themselves are
</I>&gt;<i> length
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delimited?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we always length-delimit fields so we can add options later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It isn't clear in the current draft, but I take it that the
</I>&gt;<i> splice_signature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is for the old multi-sig?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's the signature required to spend the old funding txout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; so we append to the existing `channel_update` for the original channel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using a new `message_flags` field:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMO, we need to hold off on optional fields for now, until we revisit the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formatting in order to actually get it right. As is now, all the optional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fields are basically serial mandatory soft forks. So clients must
</I>&gt;<i> understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the prior in order to understand the following fields. Instead, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; essentially need more of a map design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You need to add prior options to your wire parser, but that's usually
</I>&gt;<i> the most trivial part of handling them.  And they may waste space on the
</I>&gt;<i> wire since we treat them as append-only, but OTOH it avoids
</I>&gt;<i> combinatorial testing explosion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The post-splice reserve is 1% of post-splice capcacity (rounded down).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This should be re-negotiated at time of splice creation, rather than a
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hard coded value in the protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In addition, you can forget everything about the old channel (including
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; old HTLCs and revocation requirements).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We still have the same shachain state however (if we don't allow new
</I>&gt;<i> state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be exchanged during the start of the splicing scenario), correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
