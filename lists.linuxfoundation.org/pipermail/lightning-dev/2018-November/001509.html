Interesting. I think what you're saying is that with secp256k1 preimages
(with decorrelation), if you have the payment hash Q, then the payment
preimage q (Q=q*G) is only known to the payee and the payer (and not
any intermediaries thanks to decorrelation), so if you see a statement

  m=&quot;This invoice has been paid but not delivered as at 2018-11-05&quot;

signed by &quot;Q&quot; (so, some s,R s.t. s*G = R + H(Q,R,m)*Q) then that means
either the payee signed it, in which case there's no dispute, or the
payer signed it... And that's publicly verifiable with only the original
invoice information (ie &quot;Q&quot;).

(I don't think there's any need for multiple rounds of signatures)


FWIW, I don't see reddit as a particularly viable &quot;court&quot;; there's
no way for reddit to tell who's actually right in a dispute, eg if I
say blockstream didn't send stickers I paid for, and blockstream says
they did; ie there's no need for a sock puppet in the above scenario,
blockstream can just say &quot;according to our records you signed for
delivery, stop whinging&quot;. (And if we both agree that it did or didn't
arrive, there's no need to post cryptographic proofs to reddit afaics)

I think there's maybe four sorts of &quot;proof of payment&quot; people might
desire:

  0) no proof: &quot;completely&quot; deniable payments (donations?)

  1) shared secret: ability to prove directly to the payee that an
     invoice was paid (what we have now)

  2) signed payment: ability to prove to a different business unit of
     the payee that payment was made, so that you can keep all the 
     secrets in the payment-handling part, and have the service-delivery
     part not be at risk for losing all your money

  3) third-party verifiable: so you can associate a payment with real
     world identity information, and take them to court (or reddit) as a
     contract dispute; needs PKI infrastructure so you can be confident
     the pubkey maps to the real world people you think it does, etc

Cheers,
aj
