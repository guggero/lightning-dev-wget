&gt;<i> Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a big fan in general of most of this! Amongst many other things, it'll:
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the whole static channel backup + recovery workflow, and avoid all
</I>&gt;<i> the fee related headaches we've run into over the past few months.
</I>
I certainly hope so!

&gt;&gt;<i> - HTLC-timeout and HTLC-success txs sigs are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE, so you can Bring Your Own Fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would this mean that we no longer extend fees to the second-level
</I>&gt;<i> transactions as well? If so, then a dusty HTLC would be determined solely by
</I>&gt;<i> looking at the direct output, rather than the resulting output in the second
</I>&gt;<i> layer.
</I>
Good point, yes.

&gt;&gt;<i>  - `localpubkey`, `remotepubkey`, `local_htlcpubkey`, `remote_htlcpubkey`,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `local_delayedpubkey`, and `remote_delayedpubkey` derivation now uses a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two-stage unhardened BIP-32 derivation based on the commitment number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems enough to _only_ modify the derivation for local+remote pubkey (so
</I>&gt;<i> the direct &quot;settle&quot; keys). This constrains the change to only what's
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to simplify the backup+recovery workflow with the current
</I>&gt;<i> commitment design. By restricting the change to these two keys, we minimize
</I>&gt;<i> the code impact to the existing implementations, and avoid unnecessary
</I>&gt;<i> changes that don't make strides towards the immediate goal.
</I>
I was thinking in the long term when we drop backwards compat, then we
only have one derivation scheme?

&gt;&gt;<i> - `to_remote` is now a P2WSH of:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        `to_self_delay` OP_CSV OP_DROP &lt;remotepubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems at odds with the goal of &quot;if the remote party force closes, then
</I>&gt;<i> I get my funds back immediately without requiring knowledge of any secret
</I>&gt;<i> data&quot;. If it was just a plain p2wkh, then during a routine seed import and
</I>&gt;<i> rescan (assuming ample look ahead as we know this is a &quot;special&quot; key), I
</I>&gt;<i> would pick up outputs of channels that were force closed while I was down
</I>&gt;<i> due to my dog eating my hard drive.
</I>
Good point; we need to weigh the benefits of symmetry (which seems to
require this) against this additional complication.

&gt;<i> Alternatively, since the range of CSV values can be known ahead of time, I
</I>&gt;<i> can brute force a set of scripts to look for in the chain. However, this
</I>&gt;<i> results in potentially a very large number of scripts (depending on how many
</I>&gt;<i> channels one has, and bounds on the acceptable CSV) I need to scan for.
</I>
I don't suppose we could get everyone to agree on the same CSV values? :)

Cheers,
Rusty.
