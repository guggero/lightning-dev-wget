<PRE>Good morning all,

Taking a step back&#8212;even if key switching can be done mathematically, it seems
dubious that we would want to introduce re-routing or rendezvous routing in this
manner. If the example provided _could_ be done, it would directly violate the
wrap-resistance property of the ideal onion routing scheme defined in [1]. This
property is proven for Sphinx in section 4.3 of [2]. Schemes like HORNET [3]
support rendezvous routing and are formally proven in this model. Seems this
would be the obvious path forward, given that we've already done a considerable
amount of work towards implementing HORNET via Sphinx.

Cheers,
Conner

</I>&gt;<i> Good morning Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am nowhere near a mathematician, thus, cannot countercheck your expertise here (and cannot give a counterproposal thusly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I want to point out the below scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  C is the payer.  He is in contact with an unknown payee (who in reality is E).  E provides the onion-wrapped route D-&gt;E with ephemeral key and other data necessary, as well as informing C that D is the rendez-vous point.  Then C creates a route from itself to D (via channel C-&gt;D or via C-&gt;A-&gt;D).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  B is the payer.  He knows the entire route B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E and knows that payee is C.  Unfortunately the C&lt;-&gt;D channel is low capacity or down or etc etc.  At C, B has provided the onion-wrapped route D-&gt;E with ephemeral key and other data necessary, as well as informing to C that D is the next node.  Then C either pays via C-&gt;D or via C-&gt;A-&gt;D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if there is an off-by-one error in our thinking about rendez-vous nodes, could it not be compensated also by an off-by-one in the link-level payment splitting via intermediary rendez-vous node?
</I>&gt;<i> In short, D is the one that switches keys instead of A.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The operation of processing a hop would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Unwrap the onion with current ephemeral key.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Dispatch based on realm byte.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.1.  If realm byte 0:
</I>&gt;<i> 2.1.1.  Normal routing behavior, extract HMAC, etc etc
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.  If realm byte 2 &quot;switch ephemeral keys&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.1.  Set current ephemeral key to bytes 1 -&gt; 32 of packet.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.2.  Shift onion by one hop packet.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.3.  Goto 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would that not work?
</I>&gt;<i> (I am being naive here, as I am not a mathist and I did not understand half what you wrote, sorry)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then at C, we have the onion from D-&gt;E, we also know the next ephemeral key to use (we can derive it since we would pass it to D anyway).
</I>&gt;<i> It rightshifts the onion by one, storing the next ephemeral key to the new hop it just allocated.
</I>&gt;<i> Then it encrypts the onion using a new ephemeral key that it will use to generate the D&lt;-A&lt;-C part of the onion.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Great proposal ZmnSCPxj, but I think I need to raise a small issue with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it. While writing up the proposal for rendez-vous I came across a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem with the mechanism I described during the spec meeting: the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; padding at the rendez-vous point would usually zero-padded and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encrypted in one go with the shared secret that was generated from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previous ephemeral key (i.e., the one before the switch). That ephemeral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; key is not known to the recipient (barring additional rounds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication) so the recipient would be unable to compute the correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MACs. There are a number of solutions to this, basically setting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; padding to something that the recipient could know when generating its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; half onion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My current favorite goes like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  Rendez-vous RV receives an onion, performs ECDH like normal to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the shared secret, decrypts its payload, simultaneously encrypts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the padding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  It extracts its per-hop payload and shifts the entire packet over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     (shift its payload out and the newly generated padding in)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  It then notices that it should perform an ephemeral key switch, now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     deviating from the normal protocol (which would just be to generate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the new ephemeral key, serialize and forward)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     3.1. It zero-fills the padding that it just added (so we are in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     state that the recipient knew when generating its partial onion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     3.2 It performs ECDH with the switched in ephemeral key to get a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     shared secret that which is then used to unwrap one additional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     layer of encryption, and most importantly encrypt the padding so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the next hop doesn't see the zero-filled padding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     3.3 Only then will it generate the new ephemeral key for the next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     hop, based on the switched in ephemeral key and the newly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     generated shared secret, serialize the packet and forward it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     This has the advantage of reusing all the existing machinery but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     assembling it a bit differently, by adding a little detour when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     generating the next onion. It involves one additional ECDH at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     rendez-vous, one ChaCha20 encryption and one scalar multiplication to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     generate the next ephemeral keys. It does not need more space than the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     single ephemeral key in the per-hop payload.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     And now for the reason that I write this as a reply to your post: with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     this scheme it is not possible for C to find an ephemeral key that would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     end up identical to the one that D would require to decrypt the onion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     correctly. This would not be an issue if D is informed about this split
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     and would basically accept whatever it gets, but that kind of defeats
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the transparency that you were going for with your proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     I'm open for other proposals but I currently can't think of a way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     make sure that a) the recipient can deterministically generate the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     padding that RV will generate, and b) hide the fact that RV was indeed a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     rendez-vous point (e.g., by leaving the padding be a well known
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     constant).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Sorry for this problem, I had a mental off-by-one at the meeting that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     hadn't considered, the solution should work, but it makes this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     things a bit harder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Good morning list,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As was discussed directly in summit, we accept link-lvel payment splitting (scid is not binding), and provisionally accept rendez-vous routing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It strikes me, that even if your node has only a single channel to the next node (c-lightning), it is possible, to still perform link-level payment splitting/re-routing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For instance, consider this below graph:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       E&lt;---D---&gt;C&lt;---B
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;            ^  /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;            | /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;            |L
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;            A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the above, B requests a route from B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, C cannot send to D, since the channel direction is saturated in favor of D.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Alternately, C can route to D via A instead. It holds the (encrypted) route from D to E. It can take that sub-route and treat it as a partial route-to-payee under rendez-vous routing, as long as node A supports rendez-vous routing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This can allow re-routing or payment splitting over multiple hops.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Even though C does not know the number of remaining hops between D and the destination, its alternative is to earn nothing anyway as its only alternative is to fail the routing. At least with this, there is a chance it can succeed to send the payment to the final destination.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Regards,
