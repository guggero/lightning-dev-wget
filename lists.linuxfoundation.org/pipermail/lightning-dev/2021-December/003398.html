Re: &quot;some common aggregation service provider&quot;, you might be misunderstanding
the protocol: since seals are trustless with regard to validity, I can validate
your seal, regardless of which aggregation service you use.

But other than that, I think we're on the same page!

A concrete example would be an exchange: they do a lot of transactions, so they
could choose to be their own aggregator, and wouldn't need any multisig at all
because they can trust themselves not to censor themselves. :) Meanwhile, one
of their customers might use 3-of-5 as you suggest, as they only do a few
transactions a month.

Interestingly, in some scenarios it might be worthwhile to both run your own
aggregator, and use multisig. Eg Alice could use a 2-of-3 with two third-party
aggregators, and her own aggregation chain. If both third-parties are up, she
does no on-chain transactions at all; if one third-party is down, she can use
her own, and the remaining third-party. Thus she would only do an on-chain
transaction to defeat censorship/failure.
