<PRE>Hey AJ,

Right, I was probably confused between local/remote, especially when
we're talking about our anchor in the remote commitment (should it be
called local anchor, which is from our point of view, or remote?).

Let's call them Alice and Bob, and Bob is publishing a commitment.
Correct me if I'm wrong there, what you're suggesting is that:

* Bob's anchor on Bob's commitment can be spent with revkey
* Alice's anchor on Bob's commitment can be spent with Alice's pubkey

This does ensure that each participant is able to claim their anchor in
the latest commitment, and Alice is able to claim both anchors in any of
Bob's outdated commitments.

But I think it defeats the `OP_16 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` script branch.
We have that branch to allow anyone to spend anchor outputs *after* the
commitment is confirmed, to avoid keeping them around in the utxo set
forever. However, the trick is that the internal pubkey must be set to
something that is publicly revealed when the channel closes. Now that we
put the revkey in internal pubkeys everywhere instead of script branches,
that revkey is *not* revealed when channels close with the latest commit.
So it would prevent people from using that script branch to clean up the
utxo set...

I have currently used &lt;local_delayedpubkey&gt; and &lt;remote_pubkey&gt; because
they're revealed whenever main outputs are claimed, but there is probably
a smarter solution (maybe one that would let us use revkey here as you
suggest), this will be worth thinking about a bit more.

Thanks,
Bastien

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we're going to bump someone else's commitment, we'll use the
