I think &quot;toxic waste&quot; refers to having old data around that, if used,
could cause you to lose all the funds in your channel -- that's why it's
toxic. This is more just regular landfill :)

&gt;<i> *_anchor: dust, who cares -- might be better if local_anchor used key =

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we can use revkey, 
</I>
musig(revkey, remote_key) 
  --&gt; allows them to spend after you've revealed the secret for revkey
      you can never spend because you'll never know the secret for
      remote_key

but if you just say:

(revkey)

then you can spend (because you know revkey) immediately (because it's
an anchor output, so intended to be immediately spent) or they can spend
if it's an obsolete commitment and you've revealed the revkey secret.

&gt;<i> this would prevent us from bumping the
</I>&gt;<i> current remote commitment if it appears on-chain (because we don't know
</I>&gt;<i> the private revkey yet if this is the latest commitment). Usually the
</I>&gt;<i> remote peer should bump it, but if they don't, we may want to bump it
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves instead of publishing our own commitment (where our main
</I>&gt;<i> output has a long CSV).
</I>
If we're going to bump someone else's commitment, we'll use the
remote_anchor they provided, not the local_anchor, so I think this is
fine (as long as I haven't gotten local/remote confused somewhere along
the way).

Cheers,
aj
