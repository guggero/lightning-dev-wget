<PRE>Hi Jeremy,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

To summarize your arguments: the intentionally malicious path to getting
the 0 sat output confirmed without being spent is uneconomical compared to
simply creating dust outputs. And even if it does happen, the tx spending
from the 0 sat output may still be valid (as long as none of its inputs get
spent elsewhere) and could eventually get confirmed.

I think those are good points. I do still see a possibility where a user
non-maliciously happens to behave in a way that causes all of the above to
happen, but it does seem somewhat unlikely.

It could happen if all of the following occurs:
1. Another output happens to get spent at a higher feerate (e.g. because an
absolute timelock expires and the output gets used)
2. The tx spending the 0 sat output then happens to not make it into the
block due to the lower fees
3. The user then happens to invalidate the tx that was spending from the 0
sat output (seems rational at that point)

Assuming this is the only scenario (I am at least not currently aware of
others), the question then becomes whether the above is acceptable in order
to avoid a soft fork.

Cheers,
Ruben

</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility is to have a utxo with drop semantics; if UTXO X with
</I>&gt;<i> some flag on it is not spent in the block it is created, it expires and can
</I>&gt;<i> never be spent. This is essentially an inverse timelock, but severely
</I>&gt;<i> limited to one block and mempool evictions can be handled as if a conflict
</I>&gt;<i> were mined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These types of 0 value outputs could be present just for attaching fee in

</I>&gt;<i> cases for this: one bare segwit version (just the number, no data) and one
</I>&gt;<i> that's equivalent to taproot. This covers OP_TRUE anchors very efficiently
</I>&gt;<i> and ones that require a signature as well.

</I>&gt;<i> This is relatively similar to how Transaction Sponsors works, but without
