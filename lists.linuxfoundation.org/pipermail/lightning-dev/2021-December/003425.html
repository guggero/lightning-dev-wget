<PRE>If there is a payment to go from party A to be split between parties B &amp; C,
is it possible that only one of B or C would need a plugin?

If all receiving parties need a plugin that is quite limiting. Thanks, Ronan

&gt;<i> Good morning cdecker,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was looking into the docs [1] and stumbled over `createinvoice` which

</I>&gt;<i> invoice in the database which you don't want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, that is precisely the issue, we need a `signfakeinvoice` command,
</I>&gt;<i> as we cannot know at invoice creation time the preimage, and our invoice

</I>&gt;<i> in the database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However if you have access to the `hsm_secret` you could sign in the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin itself, completely sidestepping `lightningd`. Once you have that it
</I>&gt;<i> should be a couple of days work to get a PoC plugin for the coordination
</I>&gt;<i> and testing. From there it depends on how much polish you want to apply and
</I>&gt;<i> what other systems you want to embed it into.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the point of an `hsmd` is that it might be replaced with a driver to
</I>&gt;<i> an actual hardware signing module (H S M).
</I>&gt;<i> The `lightningd`&lt;-&gt;`hsmd` interface includes commands for invoice signing,
</I>&gt;<i> and `signfakeinvoice` would essentially just expose that interface, so an
</I>&gt;<i> HSM has to support that interface.
</I>&gt;<i> So a plugin cannot rely on `hsm_secret` existing, as the signer might not
</I>&gt;<i> be emulated in software (i.e. what we do now) but be an actual hardware
</I>&gt;<i> signer that does not keep the secret keys on the same disk.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the reason why we (well, I) created and exposed `getsharedsecret`,
</I>&gt;<i> in theory a plugin could just read `hsm_secret`, but we want to consider a
</I>&gt;<i> future where the HSM is truly a hardware module.
</I>&gt;<i>
