<PRE>Good Afternoon,

'Avoiding a soft-fork' is a political concession. Consensus is none of 
that.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize your arguments: the intentionally malicious path to
</I>&gt;<i> getting the 0 sat output confirmed without being spent is uneconomical
</I>&gt;<i> compared to simply creating dust outputs. And even if it does happen,
</I>&gt;<i> the tx spending from the 0 sat output may still be valid (as long as
</I>&gt;<i> none of its inputs get spent elsewhere) and could eventually get
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think those are good points. I do still see a possibility where a
</I>&gt;<i> user non-maliciously happens to behave in a way that causes all of the
</I>&gt;<i> above to happen, but it does seem somewhat unlikely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could happen if all of the following occurs:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Another output happens to get spent at a higher feerate (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> because an absolute timelock expires and the output gets used)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The tx spending the 0 sat output then happens to not make it into
</I>&gt;<i> the block due to the lower fees
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The user then happens to invalidate the tx that was spending from
</I>&gt;<i> the 0 sat output (seems rational at that point)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming this is the only scenario (I am at least not currently aware
</I>&gt;<i> of others), the question then becomes whether the above is acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> in order to avoid a soft fork.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Ruben

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO this is not a big problem. The problem is not if a 0 value ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enters the mempool, it's if it is never spent. And even if C2/P1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> goes in, C1 still can be spent. In fact, it increases it's feerate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with P1's confirmation so it's somewhat likely it would go in. C2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> further has to be pretty expensive compared to C1 in order to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mined when C2 would not be, so the user trying to do this has to pay
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we're worried it might never be spent again since no incentive,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's rational for miners *and users who care about bloat* to save to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disk the transaction spending it to resurrect it. The way this can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be broken is if the txn has two inputs and that input gets spent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, I think if we can say that taking advantage of keeping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 0 value output will cost you more than if you just made it above
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dust threshold, it shouldn't be economically rational to not just do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a dust threshold value output instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I'm not sure the extent to which we should bend backwards to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0 value outputs impossible v.s. making them inconvenient enough to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be popular.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consensus changes below:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another possibility is to have a utxo with drop semantics; if UTXO X
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with some flag on it is not spent in the block it is created, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expires and can never be spent. This is essentially an inverse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timelock, but severely limited to one block and mempool evictions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be handled as if a conflict were mined.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These types of 0 value outputs could be present just for attaching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fee in the mempool but be treated like an op_return otherwise. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could add two cases for this: one bare segwit version (just the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number, no data) and one that's equivalent to taproot. This covers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OP_TRUE anchors very efficiently and ones that require a signature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is relatively similar to how Transaction Sponsors works, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without full tx graph de-linkage... obviously I think if we'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entertain a consensus change, sponsors makes more sense, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expiring utxos doesn't change as many properties of the tx-graph
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validation so might be simpler.
