The tricky part is what to do when the payment partially fails. Perhaps
you keep trying with exponential backoff until the payment completes for
all parties. If this was handled at the protocol level, would you fail
the entire transaction if one of the channels failed? This is the kind
of business logic that would be tricky when designing a protocol-level
solution to this.

I think it's reasonable to handle this at the application level for now,
but perhaps some standard protocols might be useful in the future.

Cheers,
Will
