The key thing is the invoice has to get to the sender somehow in the first
place. So I don't think there's any reason to use the lightning protocol itself
for additional authentication.

&gt;<i> &gt; Going beyond that is dangerous as you're creating the ability to prove to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *third* party who made a particular payment. That raises serious problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases like government raids that need to be considered very carefully.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is why I proposed to use diffie-hellman to generate a shared secret.
</I>&gt;<i> The receiver could then have made up all the proofs themselves and are
</I>&gt;<i> therefore of no value to a third party.
</I>
The purpose of diffie-hellman is to generate a shared secret in the absense of
a secure channel. Once you have a secure channel there's no reason to use it.
Simply giving the sender the payment info is sufficient.
