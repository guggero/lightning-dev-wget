<PRE>Hello World,

Link with what, why and how: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/prayank23/22763f48199ed106e59801be43ad4efc">https://gist.github.com/prayank23/22763f48199ed106e59801be43ad4efc</A>

Two related things that I found: 

1.Koala Studio tried chess on LN in 2019 but shutdown in August 2019
2.Etleneum still has chess but works differently

Primary goal of this project can be different and focus on testing Bitcoin transactions. Secondary goal is to have fun and contribute in increasing demand for block space. Maybe an app for developers to play chess, friendly competitions, learn and share new things. 

If chess sounds boring it can be replaced with any 2 player game that works for such setup and can be played with patience over few hours/days.

Spam? Sorry zero fee transactions do not work anymore. In fact, nothing below 1 sat/vbyte fee rate would work and all transactions will pay fees that are required long term. OP_RETURN is used by many projects and excluded from UTXO set. Let me know if something looks wrong. I won't be working on this as busy with another project and recently started contributing in Wasabi.
