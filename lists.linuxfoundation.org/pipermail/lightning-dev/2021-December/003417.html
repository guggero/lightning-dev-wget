<PRE>Hey Christian,

&gt;<i>This is quite a common request, and we've used a solution I like to call

</I>&gt;<i>and `C` gets 90ksat out of a total of 100ksat:

</I>&gt;<i> 1) `C` creates an invoice with payment hash `H` for 90ksat and sends it

</I>&gt;<i> 2) `B` creates an invoice with payment hash `H` (same as the first
</I>&gt;<i>    invoice, but `B` doesn't know the preimage) for 100ksat (maybe plus
</I>&gt;<i>    a tiny bit for routing fees between `B` and `C`).
</I>&gt;<i> 3) `A` receives an invoice which appears to be from `B` for the
</I>&gt;<i>    expected total of 100ksat.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) `A` proceeds to pay the invoice to `B` like normal
</I>&gt;<i> 5) `B` receives the incoming payment, but doesn't have the preimage for
</I>&gt;<i>    `H`, so they must forward to `C` if they want to receive their
</I>&gt;<i>    share. `B` then proceeds to pay the 90ksat invoice from `C`, which
</I>&gt;<i>    reveals the preimage to them, and they can turn around and claim
</I>&gt;<i>    the incoming `100ksat` (covering both `B` and `C` share)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's a poor man's version because it requires creating two invoices and
</I>&gt;<i>`B` sees two payments (100ksat incoming, 90ksat outgoing), but the
</I>&gt;<i>overall outcome is the desired one: either both parties get paid or
</I>&gt;<i>noone gets paid. This can trivially be extended to any number of parties
</I>&gt;<i>(with reduced success probability), and will remain atomic. It also
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't require any changes on the sender side, and only minimal setup
</I>&gt;<i>between the payees. The crux here is that we somehow need to ensure `H`
</I>&gt;<i>is always the same along the entire chain of payments, but with a good
</I>&gt;<i>coordination protocol that should be feasible.
</I>
This is very cool, at least for a small number of parties. When I was
working at a record label it was very common to split between 1-5 people
on a given track, being able to atomically payout to individual artist's
lightning nodes would have been super useful at the time (assuming a
world where our artists ran lightning nodes). At some point I was
testing 600-output bitcoin transactions as a payout method, but that
looked like it was going to be economically infeasible sometime in the
future.

Has anyone coded up a 'Poor man's rendez-vous' demo yet? How hard would
it be, could it be done with a clightning plugin perhaps?

Cheers,
Will
