As I said, it's a new kind of pinning attack, distinct from other types of
pinning attack.

Often times that is true. But other times that is not true! I gave examples of
use-cases where being able to arbitrary add fees to transactions is harmful;
the onus is on you to argue why that is acceptable to burden those users with a
new class of attack.

&gt;<i> Sponsors or fee accounts would enable you to ensure the protocol you're

</I>&gt;<i> ratchet makes this work well.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
&quot;Must be able to deal with&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;Must be happy&quot;. While
those use-cases do have to deal with those exceptional cases happening
occasionally, it's harmful if an attacker can harass you by making those
exceptional cases happen frequently.
