<PRE>Hi y'all,

(TL;DR: a way to nodes to get paid to forward onion messages by adding an
upfront session creation phase that uses AMP tender a messaging session to a
receiver, with nodes being paid upfront for purchase of forwarding
bandwidth, and a session identifier being transmitted alongside onion
messages to identify paid sessions)

Onion messaging has been proposed as a way to do things like fetch invoices
directly from a potential receiver _directly_ over the existing LN. The
current proposal (packaged under the BOLT 12 umbrella) uses a new message
(`onion_message`) that inherits the design of the existing Sphinx-based
onion blob included in htlc_add messages as a way to propagate arbitrary
messages across the network. Blinded paths which are effectively an unrolled
Sphinx SURB (single use reply block), are used to support reply messages in
a more private manner. Compared to SURBs, blinded paths are more flexible as
they don't lock in things like fees or CLTV values.

A direct outcome of widespread adoption of the proposal is that the scope of
LN is expanded beyond &quot;just&quot; a decentralized p2p payment system, with the
protocol evolving to also support pseudonymous messaging and arbitrary data
transfer across the network. This expanded network (payments + arbitrary
data transfer) enables use cases like streaming video transfer, network
tunneled VPNs, large file download, popcorn time, etc -- . Depending on
one's view, the existence of such a combined protocol/network may either
elicit feelings of dread (can we really do _both_ payments _and_ data
properly in the same network?) or excitement (I finally have a censorship
resistant way to watch unboxing videos of all my favorite gadgets!).

Putting aside the discussion w.r.t if such an expanded network is desirable
and also if the combined functionality fundamentally _needs_ to exist in the
confines of a single protocol stack (eg: if LN impls packaged tor clients
would that be enough?), IMO onion messaging as currently proposed has
a few issues:

 1. As there's no explicit session creation/acceptance, a node can be
 spammed with unsolicited messages with no way to deny unwanted messages nor
 explicitly allow messages from certain senders.

 2. Nodes that forward these messages (up to 32 KB per message) receive no
 compensation for the network bandwidth their expend, effectively shuffling
 around messages for free.

 3. Rate limiting isn't concretely addressed, which may result in
 heterogeneous rate limiting policies enforced around the network, which can
 degrade the developer/user experience (why are my packets being randomly
 dropped?).

In this email I propose a way to address the issues mentioned above by
adding explicit onion messaging session creation as well as a way for nodes
to be (optionally) paid for any onion messages they forward. In short, an
explicit session creation phase is introduced, with the receiver being able
to accept/deny the session. If the session is accepted, then all nodes that
comprise the session route are compensated for allotting a certain amount of
bandwidth to the session (which is ephemeral by nature).

# High-Level Overview

Inspired by HORNETs two-phase session creation (first phase makes the
circuit, send allows data transfers), I propose we break up onion messaging
session creation into two phases. In the first phase a sender purchases
_forwarding bandwidth_ from a series of intermediate nodes and also requests
creation of a messaging session to the receiver in a single _atomic_ step.
In the second phase, assuming the session creation was successful, the
sender is able to use the purchased forwarding bandwidth to send messages to
the receiver. The session stays open until either it expires, or the
receiver runs out of cumulative forwarding bandwidth and needs to repeat the
first step.

As we'll see shortly, the created onion messaging sessions aren't tightly
coupled to the nodes that are a part of the initial session creation.
Instead session creation creates a sort of overlay network from the PoV of
the sender that can be used to transmit messages. The same route doesn't
need to be used by subsequent onion message transmissions as the sending
node may already have existing bandwidth sessions it can put together to
send a new/existing message.

One trade-off of the current approach is that a small amount of per-session
state is added to nodes that want to be paid to forward onion messages. The
current onion messaging proposal takes care to _not_ introduce any extra
state to nodes in an onion messaging path: they just decrypt/unblinded and
forward to the next hop. This proposal as it stands adds just 40-bytes-ish
of storage overhead per session (which are ephemeral so this state can be
forgotten over time). In practice, as nodes are being paid to forward, they
can ensure their pricing (more on that later) properly compensates then for
this added storage per session.

# AMP + Onion Messaging == Paid Onion Messaging

What follows is a concrete-ish sketch of how something like this can be
implemented in practice. At a high level, we use AMP to extend a push
payment to a would be receiver (which can actually just be oneself in
practice to purchase bandwidth sessions). Nodes add a new TLV to their node
announcement (alongside a new feature bit that says they only accept
payment for forwarding) that allows them to express a _new_ fee rate for
forwarding messages (distinct from normal fees as one pay per byte
transferred). Using another new TLV within the existing HTLC onion blob, the
sender transmits a 32-byte session identifier (may be distinct for each
route) to each intermediate hop. The final hop of the HTLC includes yet
another new TLV in the onion that specifies that this is an AMP payment
wishing to establish an onion messaging session that terminates at that
final hop. In the data transfer phase, the `encrypted_data_tlv` for each hop
is extended with a new type that stores the session identifier, with nodes
keeping track of the remaining forwarding bandwidth allotted to the,
rejecting messages if the session has expired or not bandwidth remains.

## Node Announcement TLV Extension

In order to allow nodes to signal that they want to be paid to forward onion
messages and also specify their pricing, we add two new TLV to the node_ann
message:

  * type: 1 (`sats_per_byte`)
   * data:
      * [`uint64`:`forwarding_rate`]
  * type: 2 (`sats_per_block`)
   * data:
      * [`uint64`:`per_block_rate`]


The `sats_per_byte` field allows nodes to price their bandwidth, ensuring
that they get paid for each chunk of allocated bandwidth. As sessions have a
fixed time frame and nodes need to store additional data within that time
frame, the `sats_per_block` allows nodes to price this cost, as they'll hold
onto the session identifier information until the specified block height
(detailed below).

As onion messages will _typically_ be fixed sized we may want to use
coursers
metering here instead of bytes, possibly paying for 1.3KB or 32 KB chunks
instead.

## Onion Messaging Identifiers

With the above nodes are able to express that they're willing to forward
messages for sats, and how much they charge per byte as well as per block.
Next we add a new TLV in the _existing_ HTLC onion blob that allows a
sending node to tender paid onion message session creation. A sketch of this
type would look something like:

  * type: 14 (`onion_session_id`)
    * data:
      * [`32*byte`:`session_id`]

After session creation succeeds, nodes will forward onion messages that
include that `onion_session_id`. The set of `encrypted_data_tlv` for onion
messages is extended to also specify a new type that stores the session ID:

  * type: 10 (`onion_session_id`)
    * data:
      * [`32*byte`:`session_id`]

When forwarding an onion message that includes an `onion_session_id` (a node
may only forward messages that contain such an ID), nodes do the necessary
bookkeeping to tally how much bandwidth if left in this session, and also
check that the session hasn't expired before forwarding.

## Session Creation

During session creation, the sender creates a series of new
`onion_session_id`'s (or a single one) for all nodes in the messaging route
it
doesn't already have an active session with. To initiate session creation,
the
node sends an AMP payment to the receiver (a push payment) that drops off
the
proper fee (as specified by the `sats_per_byte` and `sats_per_block` rate)
to
each intermediate hop along with the proposed `onion_session_id`. We also
add
another TLV (to the base onion blob) that specifies the indented lifetime of
the session:

  * type: 10 (`onion_session_expiry_height`)
    * data:
      * [`uint32`:`expiry_height`]


To accept a session, the receiver waits until all payment parts have arrived
(senders can either purchase bandwidth in bulk sessions, or do little by
little, tit-for-tat style) and pulls the payment. As the receiver needs to
receive the message in the first place, they're also compensated in a
similar manner.

Session creation is rejected (I don't want to receive messages) if the
receiver chooses to fail back _any_ of the AMP HTLC splits (they don't need
to wait until they all arrive). If a session is rejected, then nodes forget
that session ID, and its treated like any other failed HTLC. If a session is
accepted (the pre-image gets pulled and all nodes get their upfront
bandwidth payment as fees) then nodes are to remember that session ID as
they need to account for the remaining bandwidth and lifetime.

## Data Transmission + Forwarding

Once a session has been finalized, the sender can use it to send messages to
the receiver. To do so, in addition to specifying the `next_node_if` field,
they also specify the purchased `onion_session_id` in the set of
`encrypted_data_tlv`. Note that a node may already have active sessions
across the network, so initial session creation may not be required for each
new destination they want to send a message to. Over time if they're sending
frequent messages, they'll create what's effectively a personal overlay
network that they can use to send messages to any node in that set.

When forwarding onion messages, in addition to the normal
decryption/unblinding, nodes also check that the session hasn't expired and
the session also has enough bandwidth left.

# Conclusion

With the above sketch, we gain a way for nodes to be compensated for
forwarding onion messages on the network. This supplements their existing
fee revenue, potentially making it more sustainable to run a Lightning node,
depending on the demand for forwarding bandwidth by
wallets/services/applications.  Onion messaging is left mostly unchained,
aside from the addition of some new TLV types and an added storage
requirement. Clients need to keep track of these session identifiers, which
adds a small storage requirement that scales according to their number of
established sessions (decays like the node storage requirement as well).

Examining the BOLT 12 use case of using onion messaging to fetch invoices,
this scheme adds a cost to sending arbitrary messages which includes invoice
messages. To address this the receiver can do things like include the
session ID as part of the blinded paths, and prepay forwarding bandwidth for
nodes along that path. As the session IDs are in the onion itself, the
sender doesn't learn of them so they can't use them for their own arbitrary
purposes.

As AMP payments are used to create initial sessions, forwarding paid
messages across the network requires a channel to exist between all hops in
the route, unlike base onion messages that specifies one should allow
messages to nodes you don't have a channel open with.

There're still some details that need to be filled in here (in particular
how pathfinding is modified by the initial session creation, but I figure
it's useful to at least throw this out there to add some more nuance to the
conversation related to onion messaging and the added DoS potential. If
nodes are given a way to be paid for forwarding onion messages instead of
doing it for free, from my PoV it's safe to assume that they'll
overwhelmingly prefer to be paid (other than nodes that use uniform zero
fees across all channels I guess).
