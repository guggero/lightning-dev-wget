</I>&gt;<i> I figured I would share some thoughts for conceptual review that have been
</I>&gt;<i> bouncing around my head as an opportunity to clean up the fee paying
</I>&gt;<i> semantics in bitcoin &quot;for good&quot;. The design space is very wide on the
</I>&gt;<i> approach I'll share, so below is just a sketch of how it could work which
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure could be improved greatly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Transaction fees are an integral part of bitcoin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, due to quirks of Bitcoin's transaction design, fees are a part of
</I>&gt;<i> the transactions that they occur in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While this works in a &quot;Bitcoin 1.0&quot; world, where all transactions are
</I>&gt;<i> simple on-chain transfers, real world use of Bitcoin requires support for
</I>&gt;<i> things like Fee Bumping stuck transactions, DoS resistant Payment Channels,
</I>&gt;<i> and other long lived Smart Contracts that can't predict future fee rates.
</I>&gt;<i> Having the fees paid in band makes writing these contracts much more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult as you can't merely express the logic you want for the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, but also the fees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Previously, I proposed a special type of transaction called a &quot;Sponsor&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which has some special consensus + mempool rules to allow arbitrarily
</I>&gt;<i> appending fees to a transaction to bump it up in the mempool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As an alternative, we could establish an account system in Bitcoin as an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;extension block&quot;.
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> This type of design works really well for channels because the addition of
</I>&gt;<i> fees to e.g. a channel state does not require any sort of pre-planning
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. anchors) or transaction flexibility (SIGHASH flags). This sort of
</I>&gt;<i> design is naturally immune to pinning issues since you could offer to pay a
</I>&gt;<i> fee for any TXID and the number of fee adding offers does not need to be
</I>&gt;<i> restricted in the same way the descendant transactions would need to be.
</I>
So it's important to recognize that fee accounts introduce their own kind of
transaction pinning attacks: third parties would be able to attach arbitrary
fees to any transaction without permission. This isn't necessarily a good
thing: I don't want third parties to be able to grief my transaction engines by
getting obsolete transactions confirmed in liu of the replacments I actually
want confirmed. Eg a third party could mess up OpenTimestamps calendars at
relatively low cost by delaying the mining of timestamp txs.

Of course, there's an obvious way to fix this: allow transactions to designate
a pubkey allowed to add further transaction fees if required. Which Bitcoin
already has in two forms: Replace-by-Fee and Child Pays for Parent.
