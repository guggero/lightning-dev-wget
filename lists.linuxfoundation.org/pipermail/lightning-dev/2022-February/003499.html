&gt;<i> Hi y'all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (TL;DR: a way to nodes to get paid to forward onion messages by adding an
</I>&gt;<i> upfront session creation phase that uses AMP tender a messaging session to a
</I>&gt;<i> receiver, with nodes being paid upfront for purchase of forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth, and a session identifier being transmitted alongside onion
</I>&gt;<i> messages to identify paid sessions)
</I>
AMP seems to be a Lightning Labs proprietary extension.  You mean
keysend, which at least has a draft spec?

&gt;<i> Onion messaging has been proposed as a way to do things like fetch invoices
</I>&gt;<i> directly from a potential receiver _directly_ over the existing LN. The
</I>&gt;<i> current proposal (packaged under the BOLT 12 umbrella) uses a new message
</I>&gt;<i> (`onion_message`) that inherits the design of the existing Sphinx-based
</I>&gt;<i> onion blob included in htlc_add messages as a way to propagate arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> messages across the network. Blinded paths which are effectively an unrolled
</I>&gt;<i> Sphinx SURB (single use reply block), are used to support reply messages in
</I>&gt;<i> a more private manner. Compared to SURBs, blinded paths are more flexible as
</I>&gt;<i> they don't lock in things like fees or CLTV values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A direct outcome of widespread adoption of the proposal is that the scope of
</I>&gt;<i> LN is expanded beyond &quot;just&quot; a decentralized p2p payment system, with the
</I>
Sure, let's keep encouraging people to use HTLCs for free to send data?
I can certainly implement that if you prefer!

&gt;<i>  1. As there's no explicit session creation/acceptance, a node can be
</I>&gt;<i>  spammed with unsolicited messages with no way to deny unwanted messages nor
</I>&gt;<i>  explicitly allow messages from certain senders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Nodes that forward these messages (up to 32 KB per message) receive no
</I>&gt;<i>  compensation for the network bandwidth their expend, effectively shuffling
</I>&gt;<i>  around messages for free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3. Rate limiting isn't concretely addressed, which may result in
</I>&gt;<i>  heterogeneous rate limiting policies enforced around the network, which can
</I>&gt;<i>  degrade the developer/user experience (why are my packets being randomly
</I>&gt;<i>  dropped?).
</I>
Sure, this is a fun one!  I can post separately on ratelimiting; I
suggest naively limiting to 10/sec for peers with channels, and 1/sec
for peers without for now.

(In practice, spamming with HTLCs is infinitely more satisfying...)

&gt;<i> In this email I propose a way to address the issues mentioned above by
</I>&gt;<i> adding explicit onion messaging session creation as well as a way for nodes
</I>&gt;<i> to be (optionally) paid for any onion messages they forward. In short, an
</I>&gt;<i> explicit session creation phase is introduced, with the receiver being able
</I>&gt;<i> to accept/deny the session. If the session is accepted, then all nodes that
</I>&gt;<i> comprise the session route are compensated for allotting a certain amount of
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth to the session (which is ephemeral by nature).
</I>
It's an interesting layer on top (esp if you want to stream movies), but
I never proposed this because it seems to add a source-identifying
session id, which is a huge privacy step backwards.

You really *do not want* to use this for independent transmissions.

I flirted with using blinded tokens, but it gets complex fast; ideas
welcome!

&gt;<i> ## Node Announcement TLV Extension
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to allow nodes to signal that they want to be paid to forward onion
</I>&gt;<i> messages and also specify their pricing, we add two new TLV to the node_ann
</I>&gt;<i> message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * type: 1 (`sats_per_byte`)
</I>&gt;<i>    * data:
</I>&gt;<i>       * [`uint64`:`forwarding_rate`]
</I>&gt;<i>   * type: 2 (`sats_per_block`)
</I>&gt;<i>    * data:
</I>&gt;<i>       * [`uint64`:`per_block_rate`]
</I>
You mean:

   * type: 1 (`sats_per_byte`)
   * data:
       * [`tu64`:`forwarding_rate`]
   * type: 3 (`sats_per_block`)
   * data:
       * [`tu64`:`per_block_rate`]

1. Don't use an even TLV field.
2. Might as well use truncated u64.

&gt;<i> The `sats_per_byte` field allows nodes to price their bandwidth, ensuring
</I>&gt;<i> that they get paid for each chunk of allocated bandwidth. As sessions have a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed time frame and nodes need to store additional data within that time
</I>&gt;<i> frame, the `sats_per_block` allows nodes to price this cost, as they'll hold
</I>&gt;<i> onto the session identifier information until the specified block height
</I>&gt;<i> (detailed below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As onion messages will _typically_ be fixed sized we may want to use
</I>&gt;<i> coursers
</I>&gt;<i> metering here instead of bytes, possibly paying for 1.3KB or 32 KB chunks
</I>&gt;<i> instead.
</I>
I think it's a premature optimization?  Make standard duration 2016
blocks; then they can request multiples if they want?  Reduces
node_announcement size.

&gt;<i> With the above nodes are able to express that they're willing to forward
</I>&gt;<i> messages for sats, and how much they charge per byte as well as per block.
</I>&gt;<i> Next we add a new TLV in the _existing_ HTLC onion blob that allows a
</I>&gt;<i> sending node to tender paid onion message session creation. A sketch of this
</I>&gt;<i> type would look something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * type: 14 (`onion_session_id`)
</I>&gt;<i>     * data:
</I>&gt;<i>       * [`32*byte`:`session_id`]
</I>
I'd be tempted to use 16 bytes?  Collisions here are not really a thing
since you'd need a network packet per probe, and you're time limited.

&gt;<i> After session creation succeeds, nodes will forward onion messages that
</I>&gt;<i> include that `onion_session_id`. The set of `encrypted_data_tlv` for onion
</I>&gt;<i> messages is extended to also specify a new type that stores the session ID:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * type: 10 (`onion_session_id`)
</I>&gt;<i>     * data:
</I>&gt;<i>       * [`32*byte`:`session_id`]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When forwarding an onion message that includes an `onion_session_id` (a node
</I>&gt;<i> may only forward messages that contain such an ID), nodes do the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> bookkeeping to tally how much bandwidth if left in this session, and also
</I>&gt;<i> check that the session hasn't expired before forwarding.
</I>
This is good because it doesn't require a db write (if you crash and
forget to charge, it's OK).

AFAICT this is easy to implement on top of onion_messages as they stand
today (if you don't want to fwd free onion messages at all, don't set
that bit?).

Cheers,
Rusty.
