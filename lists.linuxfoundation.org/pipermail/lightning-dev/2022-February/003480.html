<PRE>Good morning shymaa,

&gt;<i> I just want to add an alarming info to this thread...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are at least 5.7m UTXOs&#8804;1000 Sat (~7%),&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 8.04 m &#8804;1$ (10%),&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 13.5m &#8804; 0.0001BTC (17%)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that bitInfoCharts took my enquiry seriously and added a main link for dust analysis:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-dustiest-bitcoin-addresses.html">https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-dustiest-bitcoin-addresses.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Here, you can see just the first address contains more than 1.7m dust UTXOs
</I>&gt;<i> (ins-outs =1,712,706 with a few real UTXOs holding the bulk of 415 BTC)&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1HckjUpRGcrrRAtFaaCAUaGjsPx9oYmLaZ">https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1HckjUpRGcrrRAtFaaCAUaGjsPx9oYmLaZ</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#187;&#187;&#187;&#187;&#187;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;That's alarming isn't it?, is it due to the lightning networks protocol or could be some other weird activity going on?
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>
I believe some blockchain tracking analysts will &quot;dust&quot; addresses that were spent from (give them 546 sats), in the hope that lousy wallets will use the new 546-sat UTXO from the same address but spending to a different address and combining with *other* inputs with new addresses, thus allowing them to grow their datasets about fund ownership.

Indeed JoinMarket has a policy to ignore-by-default UTXOs that pay to an address it already spent from, precisely due to this (apparently common, since my JoinMarket maker got dusted a number of times already) practice.

I am personally unsure of how common this is but it seems likely that you can eliminate this effect by removing outputs of exactly 546 sats to reused addresses.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
