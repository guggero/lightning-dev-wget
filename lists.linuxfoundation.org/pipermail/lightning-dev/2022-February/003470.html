<PRE>Hi all,

        I've floated this idea before, but this is a more concrete
proposal for a &quot;v2&quot; gossip protocol.

It assumes x-only pubkeys (aka point32) and BIP-340 signatures, and uses
modern TLVs for all optional or extensible fields.  Timestamps are
replaced with block heights.

1. Nodes send out weekly node_announcement_v2, proving they own some
   UTXOs.
2. This entitles them to broadcast channels, using channel_update_v2; a
   channel_update_v2 from both peers means the channel exists.
3. This uses UTXOs for anti-spam, but doesn't tie them to channels
   directly.
4. Future ZKP proofs are could be added.

1. type: 271 (`node_announcement_v2`)
2. data:
    * [`bip340sig`:`signature`]
    * [`point32`:`node_id`]
    * [`u32`:`blockheight`]
    * [`node_announcement_v2_tlvs`:`tlvs`]

1. `tlv_stream`: `node_announcement_v2_tlvs`
2. types:
    1. type: 2 (`features`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*byte`:`featurebits`]
    1. type: 3 (`chain_hash`)
    2. data:
        * [`chain_hash`:`chain`]
    1. type: 4 (`taproot_utxo_proofs`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*taproot_utxo_proof`:`proofs`]
    1. type: 6 (`legacy_utxo_proofs`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*legacy_utxo_proof`:`proofs`]
    1. type: 127 (`ipv4_addresses`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*ipv4`:`addresses`]
    1. type: 129 (`ipv6_addresses`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*ipv6`:`addresses`]
    1. type: 131 (`torv3_addresses`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*torv3`:`addr`]
# Maybe alias, color, etc?

Taproot proofs are a signature of the v1 output over the `node_id`,
`utxo` and `blockheight` with prefix &quot;lightingtaproot_utxo_proofsig&quot;
(using the tagged signatures as per BOLT12). (FIXME: what about
tapscripts?).

Legacy proofs are two signatures, similar to the existing
channel_announcement.

1. subtype: `taproot_utxo_proof`
2. data:
    * [`short_channel_id`:`utxo`]
    * [`signature`:`sig`]

1. subtype: `legacy_utxo_proof`
2. data:
    * [`short_channel_id`:`utxo`]
    * [`point`:`bitcoin_key_1`]
    * [`point`:`bitcoin_key_2`]
    * [`signature`:`sig_1`]
    * [`signature`:`sig_2`]

- node_announcement_v2 are discarded after a week (1000 blocks).
- If two node_announcement_v2 claim the same UTXO, use the first seen,
  discard any others.
- Nodes do not need to monitor existence of UTXOs after initial check (since
  they will automatically prune them after a week).
- The total proved utxo value (not counting any utxos which are spent)
  is multiplied by 10 to give the &quot;announcable_channel_capacity&quot; for that node.

1. type: 273 (`channel_update_v2`)
2. data:
    * [`bip340sig`:`signature`]
    * [`point32`:`local_node_id`]
    * [`point32`:`remote_node_id`]
    * [`u32`:`blockheight`]
    * [`u32`:`channel_id_and_claimant`]
    * [`channel_update_v2_tlvs`:`tlvs`]

1. `tlv_stream`: `channel_update_v2_tlvs`
2. types:
    1. type: 2 (`features`)
    2. data:
        * [`...*byte`:`featurebits`]
    1. type: 3 (`chain_hash`)
    2. data:
        * [`chain_hash`:`chain`]
    1. type: 4 (`capacity`)
    2. data:
        * [`tu64`:`satoshis`]
    1. type: 5 (`cost`)
    2. data:
       * [`u16`:`cltv_expiry_delta`]
       * [`u32`:`fee_proportional_millionths`]
       * [`tu32`:`fee_base_msat`]
    1. type: 6 (`min_msat`)
    2. data:
        * [`tu64`:`min_htlc_sats`]

- `channel_id_and_claimant` is a 31-bit per-node channel_id which can be
  used in onion_messages, and a one bit stolen for the `claim` flag.
- A channel is not considered to exist until both peers have sent a
  channel_update_v2, at least one of which must set the `claim` flag.
- If a node sets `claim`, the capacity of the channel is subtracted from
  the remaining announcable_channel_capacity for that node (minimum
  10,000 sats).
- If there is insufficient total `announcable_channel_capacity` for a
  node, it is used by the lower `channel_id`s first.

Implications
------------

This simplifies gossip, requiring only two messages instead of three,
and reducing the UTXO validation requirements to per-node instead of
per-channel.  We can use a convention that a channel_update_v2 with no
`capacity` is a permanent close.

We might want to add a taproot_utxo_delegated_proof where UTXOs can
sign over to another key, so cold storage only needs to sign once, and
the other key can sign weekly.

It also allows &quot;leasing&quot; of UTXOs: you could pay someone to sign their
UTXO for your node_announcement, with some level of trust.  They could
spend the UTXO, which gives you a slow degredation as new nodes don't
accept your channels but existing nodes don't check until it's due for a
refresh).  Or they could sign one UTXO for multiple node_announcements,
which is why preference is given to the first-seen.  But it's a weekly
business so there's incentive for them not to.

Between nodes there's the question of &quot;who claims this new channel?&quot;,
which I didn't address here.  Opener claims is logical, but leaks
information (though you could definitely pay for the peer to claim it).
With dual-funding, it's more complex (some kind of proportional coinflip
protocol is possible), but basically you can always wait for your peer,
and if they don't set the claim bit you can.

Cheers!
Rusty.
