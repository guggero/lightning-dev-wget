<PRE>Good Afternoon,

I am briefly reading the suggestion subject titled this email message. 
The problem this idea addresses is not new, it is as old as computer 
science with complexity and security varying from unused products in a 
supermarket database to unused bank accounts and records of transactions 
for archival. In the former, it is of no consequence to remove unused 
products from the database if the itemised sales history is not 
necessary and the report data is maintained ie. where the reporting is 
stored generated. Once the products are removed it is impossible to 
regenerate the detailed reports that called on the product-specific and 
sales information. Archival works in a manner to remove data from 
commonly used tables and to optimise them and if the data is later 
required it can be recalled from larger possibly slower storage, or 
simply kept in a larger less optimised table, in either case, all of the 
data is still available. In the latter, it is a matter of consequence 
and although archival is possible it is still necessary to ensure that 
all archives are backed up, and the data can never be removed. This is 
because if in an example transaction data is deleted after seven years 
then it is no longer possible to see how an account has its balance and 
an empty account with no transactions may be removed while actually 
still holding a significant balance. If a mistake is made the result is 
the same. This is because we allowed deletion of accounting records. 
Actually, the recommendation from Computer Science all along is the same 
as our case with Bitcoin - nothing should be deleted from the Blockchain 
forever. For one substantiative reason, this is because it is necessary 
for any client to be able to validate the blockchain in its entirety and 
some clients may only be receiving information as to the state of the 
blockchain from you. When you keep the entire blockchain you validate to 
everybody else that you have the correct records. I arbitrarily object 
to the use of pruned nodes but find them useful since the process of 
validation is completed in its entirety when a new node comes online 
even if it is pruned, but if only pruned nodes are available then 
everybody has to believe the other nodes and this is unacceptable for 
Bitcoin. It should be if some node is archiving UTXO's then it should 
count as a pruned node, but my suggestion is, instead of making a 
programming change just set your node with the parameter `prune=1` if 
you wish to allow manually pruning from the Blockchain to a specific 
height when you wish, or `prune= {&gt;550} automatically prune blocks to 
stay under target size in MiB`. My chain state database after all is 
only 4.9GB and is hardly a concern for any operation of the standard 
Bitcoin Core client. The answer, again, is you should just leave it and 
get used to dealing with the bigger database.
