&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good morning Paul,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think I can stop people from being ignorant about Drivechain.
</I>&gt;<i> But I can at least allow the Drivechain-knowledgable to identify each other.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So here below, I present a little &quot;quiz&quot;. If you can answer all of these
</I>&gt;<i> questions, then you basically understand Drivechain:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0. We could change DC to make miner-theft impossible, by making it a
</I>&gt;<i> layer1 consensus rule that miners never steal. Why is this cure worse than
</I>&gt;<i> the disease?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now miners are forced to look at all sideblocks, not optionally do so if
</I>&gt;<i> it is profitable for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. If 100% hashrate wanted to steal coins from a DC sidechain *as
</I>&gt;<i> quickly as possible*, how long would this take (in blocks)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 13,150 (I think this is how you changed it after feedback from this list,
</I>&gt;<i> I think I remember it was ~3000 before or thereabouts.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Per sidechain per year (ie, per 52560 blocks), how many DC
</I>&gt;<i> withdrawals can take place (maximum)? How many can be attempted?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      (Ie, how does the 'train track metaphor' work, from ~1h5m in the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Overview and Misconceptions&quot; video)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hate watching videos, I can read faster than anyone can talk (except
</I>&gt;<i> maybe Laolu, he speaks faster than I can process, never mind read).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ~4 times (assuming 52560 block per year, which may vary due to new miners,
</I>&gt;<i> hashrate drops, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Only two types of people should ever be using the DC withdrawal
</I>&gt;<i> system at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   3a. Which two?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a.  Miners destroying the sidechain because the sidechain is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> viable.
</I>&gt;<i> b.  Aggregators of sidechain-to-minechain transfers and large whales.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   3b. How is everyone else, expected to move their coins from chain to
</I>&gt;<i> chain?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cross-system atomic swaps.
</I>&gt;<i> (I use &quot;System&quot; here since the same mechanism works for Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> channels, and channels are not blockchains.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   3c. (Obviously, this improves UX.) But why does it also improve
</I>&gt;<i> security?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Drivechain-based pegged transfers are aggregates of many smaller transfers
</I>&gt;<i> and thus every transfer out from the sidechain contributes its &quot;fee&quot; to the
</I>&gt;<i> security of the peg.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. What do the parameters b and m stand for (in the DC security model)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> m is how much people want to kill a sidechain, 0 = everybody would be sad
</I>&gt;<i> if it died and would rather burn all their BTC forever than continue
</I>&gt;<i> living, 1 = do not care, &gt; 1 people want to actively kill the sidechain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b is how much profit a mainchain miner expects from supporting a sidechain
</I>&gt;<i> (do not remember the unit though).
</I>&gt;<i> Something like u = a + b where a is the mainchain, b is the sidechain, u
</I>&gt;<i> is the total profit.
</I>&gt;<i> Or fees?  Something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5. How can m possibly be above 1? Give an example of a
</I>&gt;<i> sidechain-attribute which may cause this situation to arise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sidechain is a total scam.
</I>&gt;<i> A bug may be found in the sidechain that completely negates any security
</I>&gt;<i> it might have, thus removing any desire to protect the sidechain and
</I>&gt;<i> potentially make users want to destroy it completely rather than let it
</I>&gt;<i> continue.
</I>&gt;<i> People end up hating sidechains completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6. For which range of m, is DC designed to deter sc-theft?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> m &lt;= 1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7. If DC could be changed to magically deter theft across all ranges of
</I>&gt;<i> m, why would that be bad for sidechain users in general?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the sidechain would already be part of mainchain consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8. If imminent victims of a DC-based theft, used a mainchain UASF to
</I>&gt;<i> prohibit the future theft-withdrawal, then how would this affect non-DC
</I>&gt;<i> users?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the non-DC users do not care, then they are unaffected.
</I>&gt;<i> If the non-DC users want to actively kill the sidechain, they will
</I>&gt;<i> counterattack with an opposite UASF and we have a chainsplit and sadness
</I>&gt;<i> and mutual destruction and death and a new subreddit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9. In what ways might the BTC network one day become uncompetitive? And
</I>&gt;<i> how is this different from caring about a sidechain's m and b?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it does not enable scaling technology fast enough to actually be able
</I>&gt;<i> to enable hyperbitcoinization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sidechains are not a scaling solution, so caring about m and b is
</I>&gt;<i> different because your focus is not on scaling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10. If DC were successful, Altcoin-investors would be harmed. Two
</I>&gt;<i> Maximalist-groups would also be slightly harmed -- who are these?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
