<PRE>Hi Omer,

Thank you for raising the topic of quorum key management for Lightning.  I
believe this approach is an important direction for securing Lightning
nodes.  Please see comments below.

Well, that's an assumption. :)  In general, an attacker may also control
one or more peers, either because they compromised them or because they
initiated a connection to the target node.


&gt;<i> Usually the attacked machine/device will have security measures in place:

&gt;<i> have only read or only  write access for example which means it can steal
</I>&gt;<i> some keys while not
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Also a significant assumption, since in many cases an attacker can
completely compromise a system.  It would be a much stronger security
posture if we defended against this too.  What is the motivation for these
assumptions?  Did you feel it's too difficult to defend against arbitrary
compromise?

I also want to mention that there are many ways funds can be lost in
Lightning once we assume that the node software can be fully compromised.
I believe we can defend against all these, but it requires implementation
of a relatively large set of controls in the key management layer.  In the
Lightning Signer project we attempt to enumerate these controls - see:
<A HREF="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/docs/-/blob/master/policy-controls.md">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/docs/-/blob/master/policy-controls.md</A>

For example - one of the more complex policy controls is &quot;HTLC receive
channel validity - the funding UTXO of the receive channel must be active
on-chain with enough depth&quot;.  i.e. we have to check that routed HTLCs are
coming from a valid channel or we could have all funds siphoned off over
time.

Looking forward to further work on this.
