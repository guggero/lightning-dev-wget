&gt;<i> I think immediate broadcast of signaling TX is a bad idea even if it's done
</I>&gt;<i> over lightning since it leaks that the UTXO associated with the signaling
</I>&gt;<i> TX is creating a channel (even if the channel was meant to be private).
</I>&gt;<i> You could argue that the signaling TX need not be associated with a UTXO
</I>&gt;<i> but I find this awkward.
</I>&gt;<i> Lazily broadcast, signaling txs are a good way to protect against
</I>&gt;<i> sequential attacks but are weak against parallel attacks. Unfortunately I
</I>&gt;<i> think protection of the former means very little without the latter.
</I>
Agreed.  Let's PoDLE!

&gt;<i> Let H0 and H1 be 32-byte output hash functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In any of the `tx_add_input` messages the initiator may attach a PoDLE
</I>&gt;<i> which contains the public key for an input as well as a P2 (the public key
</I>&gt;<i> projected onto a different generator).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Upon receiving the PoDLE, the peer checks its validity and creates a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;claim&quot; message claiming the UTXO which contains.
</I>&gt;<i>     i) H0(P2)
</I>&gt;<i>     ii) A MAC (e.g. Poly1305) produced with the H1(P2) as the key and
</I>&gt;<i> claimer_node_id as the message -- required so conflicting claim messages
</I>&gt;<i> can only be produced by someone who actually knows P2.
</I>&gt;<i>     iii) The claimer_node_id and a BIP340 signature under it over the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of the message data -- required to stop spam: only accept and re-broadcast
</I>&gt;<i> these messages from nodes who have real channels.
</I>
Note: we can avoid leaking claimer_node_id (Hey, look at me, someone's
opening a channel with me now!).  The purpose of claimer_node_id is to
restrict spam (you need to have broadcasted a valid open channel to be
recognized by the network as a valid node_id), but we can make this
direct: require a utxo + the script needed to spend it, and any key in
that script will serve in place of claimer_node_id (for v1
segwit, the output itself may serve as key).

Since we're headed to an anchor (or Eltoo) world where nodes have to
keep a few UTXOs around for emergencies anyway, this may have better
privacy.  At worst, they use a key from an existing, public channel
UTXO, which is no worse than using their node_id.

&gt;<i> Now I'd like to make the strongest possible argument against it in favor of
</I>&gt;<i> just doing nothing (for now) at the protocol level about this problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the following propositions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The public nodes that will offer dual funding and are susceptible to
</I>&gt;<i> this attack will be the kind that have a lot of churn i.e. they dual fund a
</I>&gt;<i> channel, when that closes they use the remaining funds to fund another
</I>&gt;<i> channel.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Chainalysis already works very well at identifying the UTXOs these kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of nodes. If the change output of a funding or the closing output are
</I>&gt;<i> reused in another public channel it is easy to identify which node was
</I>&gt;<i> funding what with the techniques in [1,2].
</I>
Less true after taproot though?

&gt;<i> 3. It is therefore rather redundant to do this type of active UTXO probing
</I>&gt;<i> since all you need to do is wait and be patient. Churning public nodes will
</I>&gt;<i> eventually use their UTXO to do a dual or single funding. Then by
</I>&gt;<i> cross-layer de-anonymization techniques you will be able to determine that
</I>&gt;<i> they owned that UTXO without ever interacting with the node.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. These techniques can even be applied to private channels at least while
</I>&gt;<i> they are identifiable on the blockchain (in [2] using chainalysis they can
</I>&gt;<i> identify one node involved in a private channel 79% of the time).
</I>&gt;<i> 5. There is of course some extra advantage in doing this attack but looking
</I>&gt;<i> at the effectiveness of techniques in [1,2] and my intuition about how
</I>&gt;<i> churning nodes are most susceptible to these techniques I *guess* it
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be much. If this is the case then chainalysis companies may not be
</I>&gt;<i> able to justify  doing active attacks when passive attacks work almost as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. It may be more effective to deal with UTXO probing outside of the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol. For example, a group of dual-funders could maintain a shared UTXO
</I>&gt;<i> blacklist and use chainalysis on it to not only ban single UTXOs but entire
</I>&gt;<i> clusters of outputs. i.e. do chainalysis on the chainalyzers! There are
</I>&gt;<i> some efforts to create open tools to do Chainalysis [3] that could be
</I>&gt;<i> leveraged against this attack. This might be much more effective than
</I>&gt;<i> PoDLEs as just spending the output somewhere else would not be enough to
</I>&gt;<i> use it again in the attack.
</I>&gt;<i> 7. The above PoDLE proposal actually creates a new extra bit of data that
</I>&gt;<i> can be used for chainalysis -- when you broadcast the claim message you are
</I>&gt;<i> saying you're going to make a dual funded channel sometime soon. So
</I>&gt;<i> Chainalysis can look in the next block for something that looks like a dual
</I>&gt;<i> funding and know you participated. This could be quite valuable for them
</I>&gt;<i> and I would hesitate to give it to them in the anticipation of them doing
</I>&gt;<i> an attack they may never actually do.
</I>&gt;<i> 8. If all of the above points are not enough to prevent this attack from
</I>&gt;<i> being widespread and the above PoDLE proposal is still the best idea I
</I>&gt;<i> guess it wouldn't be too hard to shoehorn it into the protocol later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment my bias is towards doing nothing and keeping things simple.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems chainalysis techniques are effective at associating funding UTXOs
</I>&gt;<i> to nodes for the most common usage patterns. Taproot will change the game
</I>&gt;<i> for private channels but won't do much for public channels.
</I>&gt;<i> Having said that -- it was a thing in JoinMarket so I might be wrong. I can
</I>&gt;<i> offer some conjecture as to why JoinMarket had this issue: if you can find
</I>&gt;<i> all the maker UTXOs before and after a join then you have removed a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> the anonymity set. Since CoinJoin is a UTXO privacy technology this makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>
I also agree; it's fairly easy to add later with a feature bit, and I
think we now have a roadmap on how it should be done.  Let's not boil
the ocean.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am told there is a new revision of [1] coming out any day now that will
</I>&gt;<i> present a few more tricks and have contributions directly from a scientist
</I>&gt;<i> at Chainalsysis (the company).
</I>
I'll add to my reading list (or wait for one of my colleagues to provide
the TL;DR!).

Cheers!
Rusty.
