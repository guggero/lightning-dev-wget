<PRE>Dear Subhra,

as discussed bilaterally and after clarification of your question the
situation is as follows:

Let us assume A and B have a channel in which A has 4 tokens and B has 6
tokens

Now A offers an HTLC with the amount of 2 tokens and B accepts (receives)
the offer then A and B both have negotiated the HTLC output in the most
recent commitment transaction.

If A stops responding and B has to force close the channel a commitment
transaction with 3 UTXOs will hit the chain. One UTXO with 2 tokens
spendable by A, another one with 6 tokens spendable by B and the received
HTLC output with 2 tokens. This one can be spend by two different
conditions as in the offchain protocol

1.) Before the timelock of the HTLC has passed B can spend the output if B
knows his to_local HTLC secret AND the preimage. OR
2.) after the timelock A can spend the output if A knows the to_remote HTLC
secret.

the mechanism with HTLCs can be read upon in BOLT 2 (channel operation
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md</A>)
and the scripts can be seen in BOLT 3:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md</A>

A less technical summary that is more focused on explaining the concepts is
currently being developed in the routing chapter of mastering the lightning
network:

With kind regards Rene Pickhardt
