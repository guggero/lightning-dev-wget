The statelessness of compact block filters does look useful. Bloom
filters for
blocks can be inefficient, during a scan with a BIP37 wallet, it's
necessary to
discard already received merkle blocks as the filter has been updated
and the
previous results may have missed transactions. Both bitcoinj [1] and
breadwallet-core [2] handle it using a similar method. The alternative of
synchronizing and alternating between requesting blocks and filter
updates leads
to slow scan times. With compact block filters, a separate wallet
process (from
the full node) can make adjustments necessary to what it needs to filter
without
having to communicate with the full node.
