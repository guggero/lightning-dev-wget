</I>
This is actually somewhat my point. If the RPC interface was good for this
and *didn't* introduce risks, we could just use that and be done with it.
But I'm finding there are many use cases that you want to have low cost
ways to serve peer services to people whom you have given explicit
permission, but they shouldn't have full ability to administrate the node.

Perhaps I wasn't explicit in my previous note but what I mean is that there
seems to be a demand for something *in between* a peer interface, and an
owner interface. I have little opinion as to whether this belongs in core
or not, I think there are much more experienced folks who can weight in on
that, but without something like this, you cannot limit your exposure for
serving something like bip157 filters without removing your own ability to
make use of some of those same services.
