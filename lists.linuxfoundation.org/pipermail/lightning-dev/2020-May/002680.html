No, it cannot be shifted. This would compromise Bitcoin itself, which for 
security depends on the assumption that a supermajority of the economy is 
verifying their incoming transactions using their own full node.

The past few years has seen severe regressions in this area, to the point 
where Bitcoin's future seems quite bleak. Without serious improvements to the 
full node ratio, Bitcoin is likely to fail.

Therefore, all efforts to improve the &quot;full node-less&quot; experience are harmful, 
and should be actively avoided. BIP 157 improves privacy of fn-less usage, 
while providing no real benefits to full node users (compared to more 
efficient protocols like Stratum/Electrum).

For this reason, myself and a few others oppose merging support for BIP 157 in 
Core.

</I>&gt;<i> real financial infrastructure access.

If Bitcoin can't do it, then Bitcoin can't do it.
Bitcoin can't solve *any* problem if it becomes insecure itself.
