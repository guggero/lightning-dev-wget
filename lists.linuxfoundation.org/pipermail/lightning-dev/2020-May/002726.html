Our FullyNoded2 multisig wallet on iOS &amp; Mac, communicates with your own
personal node over RPC, securing the connection using Tor over a hidden
onion service and two-way client authentication using a v3 Tor
Authentication key: <A HREF="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2">https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2</A>

It many ways the app (and its predecessor FullyNoded1) is an interface
between a personal full node and a user.

However, we do wish that the full RPC functionality was not exposed in
bitcoin-core. I&#8217;d love to see a cryptographic capability mechanism such
that the remote wallet could only m ask the node functions that it needs,
and allow escalation for other rarer services it needs with addition
authorization.

This capability mechanism feature set should go both ways, to a minimum
subset needed for being a watch-only transaction verification tool, all the
way to things RPC can&#8217;t do like deleting a wallet and changing bitcoin.conf
parameters and rebooting, without requiring full ssh access to the server
running the node.

If there are people interested in coordinating some proposals on how to
defining different sets of wallet functionality, Blockchain Commons would
be interested in hosting that collaboration. This could start as just being
a transparent shim between bitcoin-core &amp; remote RPC, but later could
inform proposals for the future of the core wallet functionality as it gets
refactored.
