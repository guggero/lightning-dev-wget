An idea I was thinking about was having three ports for a full node:

1) Consensus bitcoin protocol. This is the existing peer-to-peer
protocol without additional services.
2) Wallet services protocol. Adds additional functionality for wallets.
For example bloom filtering, compact block filters, and potentially
output and address indexes for electrum-like support. It's nearly
identical to the consensus peer-to-peer protocol, supporting the same
wire format. As it's on another port, various middleware could be added
to support various authentication and transports.
3) Control interface. This is the existing JSON-RPC interface, without
all wallet related RPC methods.
