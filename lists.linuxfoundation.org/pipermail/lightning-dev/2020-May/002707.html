<PRE>

&gt;<i>If everyone runs such a privately-owned server, on the other hand, this
</I>&gt;<i>is not so different from having a Lightning node you run at your home
</I>&gt;<i>that has a fullnode as well and which you access via a remote control
</I>&gt;<i>mobile device, and it is the inconvenience of having such a server at
</I>&gt;<i>your home that prevents this in the first place.
</I>
Private full nodes serving headers to a handful of weak devices have been mentioned many times as a good solution against all sorts of problems in a future full of LN + SPV nodes. I agree. It should be therefore a top priority to make the UX of connecting my mobile LN client to my home full node extremely easy, so that centralised services can't improve much on that step. Especially if I already run a full node.

Could someone briefly describe how this UX looks currently? And if it's not as seamless as it could, what blockers are there?

Best,
Orfeas
