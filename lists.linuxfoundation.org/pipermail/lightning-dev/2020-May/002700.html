<PRE>Hi Christopher,

Thanks for Blockchain Commons and Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line!

&gt;<i> If there are people interested in coordinating some proposals on how to
</I>defining different sets of wallet functionality, Blockchain Commons would
be interested in hosting that collaboration. This could start as just being
a transparent shim between bitcoin-core &amp; remote RPC, but later could
inform proposals for the future of the core wallet functionality as it gets
refactored.

Yes generally refactoring in Core wallets are making good progress [0]. I'm
pretty sure feedbacks and proposals on future changes with regards to
usability would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe you can bring these during a IRC meeting ?

Antoine

</I>&gt;<i> that the remote wallet could only m ask the node functions that it needs,
</I>&gt;<i> and allow escalation for other rarer services it needs with addition
