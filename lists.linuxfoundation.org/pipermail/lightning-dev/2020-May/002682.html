Hi Luke,

I have heard this claim made several times but have never understood the
argument behind it. The question I always have is: If I get scammed by not
verifying my incoming transactions properly how can this affect anyone
else? It's very unintuative.  I've been scammed several times in my life in
fiat currency transactions but as far as I could tell it never negatively
affected the currency overall!

The links you point and from what I've seen you say before refer to &quot;miner
control&quot; as the culprit. My only thought is that this is because a light
client could follow a dishonest majority of hash power chain. But this just
brings me back to the question. If, instead of BTC, I get a payment in some
miner scamcoin on their dishonest fork (but I think it's BTC because I'm
running a light client) that still seems to only to damage me. Where does
the side effect onto others on the network come from?

Cheers,

LL
