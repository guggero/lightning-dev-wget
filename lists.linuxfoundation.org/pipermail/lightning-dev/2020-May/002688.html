<PRE>&gt;<i> The choice between whether we offer them a light client technology that
</I>is better or worse for privacy and scalability.

And offer them a solution which would scale in the long-term.

Again it's not an argumentation against BIP 157 protocol in itself, the
problem I'm interested in is how implementing BIP157 in Core will address
this issue ?

<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> There doesn't seem to be anything in the original email that's specific to
</I>&gt;<i> BIP 157. It's a restatement of the arguments against light clients:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - light clients are a burden on the full nodes that serve them
</I>&gt;<i> - if light clients become more popular, there won't be enough full nodes
</I>&gt;<i> to serve them
</I>&gt;<i> - people might build products that depend on altruistic nodes serving
</I>&gt;<i> data, which is unsustainable
</I>&gt;<i> - maybe at some point in the future, light clients will need to pay for
</I>&gt;<i> services
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The choice isn't between people using light clients or not. People already
</I>&gt;<i> use light clients. The choice between whether we offer them a light client
</I>&gt;<i> technology that is better or worse for privacy and scalability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The arguments for why BIP 157 is better than the existing light client
</I>&gt;<i> technologies are available elsewhere, but to summarize:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - they're unique for a block, which means they can easily be cached.
</I>&gt;<i> Serving a filter requires no computation, just i/o (or memory access for
</I>&gt;<i> cached filter/header data) and bandwidth. There are plenty of other
</I>&gt;<i> services that a full node offers that use i/o and bandwidth, such as
</I>&gt;<i> serving blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> - unique-for-block means clients can download from multiple sources
</I>&gt;<i> - the linked-headers/filters model allows hybrid approaches, where headers
</I>&gt;<i> checkpoints can be fetched from trusted/signed nodes, with intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> headers and filters fetched from untrusted sources
</I>&gt;<i> - less possibilities to DoS/waste resources on the serving node
</I>&gt;<i> - better for privacy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The intention, as I understood it, of putting BIP157 directly into
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoind was to essentially force all `bitcoind` users to possibly service
</I>&gt;<i> BIP157 clients
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please. No-one is forcing anyone to do anything. To serve filters, a node
</I>&gt;<i> user needs to download the latest version, set `-blockfilterindex=basic` to
</I>&gt;<i> build the compact filters index, and set `-peercfilters` to serve them over
</I>&gt;<i> P2P. This is an optional, off-by-default feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> John

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good morning ariard and luke-jr
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Trust-minimization of Bitcoin security model has always relied first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; above on running a full-node. This current paradigm may be shifted by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; where fast, affordable, confidential, censorship-resistant payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; may attract a lot of adoption without users running a full-node.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; No, it cannot be shifted. This would compromise Bitcoin itself, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; security depends on the assumption that a supermajority of the economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; verifying their incoming transactions using their own full node.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The past few years has seen severe regressions in this area, to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; where Bitcoin's future seems quite bleak. Without serious improvements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; full node ratio, Bitcoin is likely to fail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore, all efforts to improve the &quot;full node-less&quot; experience are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harmful,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and should be actively avoided. BIP 157 improves privacy of fn-less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usage,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; while providing no real benefits to full node users (compared to more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; efficient protocols like Stratum/Electrum).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For this reason, myself and a few others oppose merging support for BIP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 157 in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Core.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BIP 157 can be implemented as a separate daemon that processes the blocks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloaded by an attached `bitcoind`, i.e. what Wasabi does.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The intention, as I understood it, of putting BIP157 directly into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bitcoind was to essentially force all `bitcoind` users to possibly service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BIP157 clients, in the hope that a BIP157 client can contact any arbitrary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fullnode to get BIP157 service.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is supposed to improve to the situation relative to e.g. Electrum,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where there are far fewer Electrum servers than fullnodes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, as ariard computes, deploying BIP157 could lead to an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effective DDoS on the fullnode network if a large number of BIP157 clients
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Though maybe this will not occur very fast?  We hope?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that the thing that *could* be done would be to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watchtowers provide light-client services, since that seems to be the major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business model of watchtowers, as suggested by ariard as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is still less than ideal, but maybe is better than nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
