<PRE>Hi list,

As it has been discussed before, a solution to mitigate jamming
attacks over the Lightning Network consists in the introduction of
credentials that must be acquired by HTLC senders to lock each hop
liquidity along the forwarding path. Those credentials can be
privacy-preserving to mask the identity of the HTLC senders towards
the routing hops. They serve as a monetary hedge in case of default of
the HTLC sender on the payment of the routing fees.

As additional advantages, this credentials framework, dubbed &quot;Staking
Credentials&quot;, can be deployed to mitigate other liquidity timevalue
DoS in the Lightning landscape, e.g collaborative transaction
construction or even beyond as an enhanced paywall to access Nostr
relay services [0].

This post gives an overview of the framework by detailing the key
concepts, laying out the protocol phases, showing concrete examples
and presenting the upsides and downsides of this mitigation approach
for jamming.

## Protocol Abstractions

The protocol relies on basic mechanisms of the Lightning Network such
as the onion messages, blinded paths where the sender doesn't know who
is the recipient and gossips, an information dissemination protocol
not relying on third-party.

Beyond, new abstractions are introduced:
- credentials: unique keys establishing attributes of the bearer,
those keys can be blinded [1].
- scarce assets: e.g a Bitcoin transaction, a Lightning payment,
chaumian ecash, UTXO ownership proofs.
- Requester/Issuer entities: the Requester requires from the Issuer
authentication of credentials in exchange for submitting scarce
assets.
- Client/Provider entities: the Client requires from the Provider a
service in exchange of submitting a credential.

## Protocol Phases

The first phase of the protocol is the discovery by a user of the
`credentials_policy` and `service_policy` gossips originating
respectively from Issuers and Providers. By reading the
`service_policy`, a user can discover the list of credentials Issuer a
target service Provider is relying on.

The user in the role of the Requester starts by committing a scarce
asset as announced by the Issuer's `credentials_policy`. E.g the
Requester sends a Bitcoin on-chain to a destination scriptPubkey
previously announced by the gossip mechanism. The user attaches the
scarce asset proof with a set of blinded credentials, finds an onion
path to the Issuer and sends the whole inside an onion message.

When the Issuer receives the scarce asset proofs and the set of
credentials, the proof is first verified e.g the on-chain payment must
be confirmed to a destination scriptPubkey controlled by the Issuer.
If the proof is correct and the scarce asset cost matches the quantity
of credentials as announced by `credentials_policy`, the blinded
credentials are countersigned by the Issuer and the signatures replied
back to the Requester by using a blinded path.

The Requester receives the Issuer signature and should verify they're
correct under the announced issuance public key in
`credentials_policy`. If they are valid, the credentials can be
unblinded and consumed for the satisfaction of a service or correct
the transactional asymmetries of a Bitcoin financial contract (e.g the
signature release for a dual-funding transaction).

Alternatively, the credentials usage can be delegated to another user
under the warning than for the second-user, there is no guarantee the
credential transfer is not double-spend.

The user in the role of the Client forwards the unblinded credentials
and the corresponding Issuer signatures to a target service Provider.
The service request can be protocol-specific and linked with the
credentials submission with a simple pair of identifiers (e.g a
32-byte random value). At reception by the Provider, the signatures on
the unblinded credentials must be verified against the corresponding
Issuance public key. The quantity of credentials must be equal to the
service units requested as announced by `service_policy`.

If those checks are correct, the Provider is satisfying the Client
service request, and additionally can provide back authentication
signatures for a new set of blinded credentials (optionally attached
in the service request issued by the Client).

## Example: Lightning jamming

Alice, the routing hop, cumulates in this deployment both the role of
Issuer and Provider. As an Issuer, she announces how much Lightning
satoshis she wishes to be paid to countersign a quantity of N
credentials in `credentials_policy`. As a Provider, she announces how
much credentials she wishes to allow a lockup of her 10_000 sats
Lightning channels for 100 blocks in `service_policy`.

Bob the HTLC sender discovers Alice's `credentials_policy`, sends a
Lightning payment to Alice and then collects a quantity of N signed
blinded credentials during a issuance dance with Alice. After this,
Bob can build a payment path going through Alice, where her hop's
onion `payload` includes an identifier Z. Bob transfers the signed
unblinded credentials with the same identifier Z through onion routing
to Alice node.

Alice node verifies the credentials with respect to her
`service_policy` for the forwarding of HTLC. If this is correct, the
HTLC is forward over her 10_000 sats Lightning channel. If the HTLC
settlement is successful, a new quantity of blinded credentials is
countersigned by Alice to reward Bob for the efficient usage of her
liquidity.

## Protocol Upsides

The credentials allows a service Provider to establish a dynamic
risk-management policy, where the submission of credentials is
disabled during the &quot;peaceful&quot; state and where credentials must bind
to 100% of the timevalue of the liquidity service in case of &quot;war&quot;
state. E.g for jamming, the cost of the credentials can match 100% of
the routing fees announced in `channel_update.

The blinding of the credentials should preserve the privacy of the
HTLC senders, therefore preventing deanonymization of the payments, or
selective censorship of the HTLC forward by a specific HTLC sender.

The credentials enable an emergent discount effect, where in case of
&quot;honest&quot; behavior of the Client in the usage of the service, they can
be rewarded by fresh credentials, therefore reducing the operational
cost of their future service usage.

The credentials framework should be generic enough to adapt to
multiple Bitcoin flows beyond HTLC forwarding, and the Lightning
jamming issue. Other flows of interest can be to cover the asymmetries
in collaborative transaction construction, e.g the order of the
release of the contributed UTXOs signatures. Qualitative credentials
could be deployed enabling bounded routing fees or SLA of liquidity
during periods of Lightning network congestion.

There is a Rust implementation in early progress, with a short-term
goal to have the full Staking Credential flow working in its
non-blinded version for a 1-hop payment path.

Cheers,
Antoine
