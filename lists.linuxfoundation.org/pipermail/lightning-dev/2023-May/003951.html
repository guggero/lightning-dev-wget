<PRE>Pressumption of innocence?
Right to defend yourself?

Wow, that sounds amazing, but, for example, wouldn't me defendibg myself
from jeremy rubin be offtopic like...pretty much everywhere?
Not sure you're familiar with that story, certainly you didn't hear my side
of the story, did you?
Where would it be fine for me to defend myself?
I don't want to keep cosing bitcoin anymore, novody would review my PRs
anyway once jeremy made sure everyone thought I am evil. Or perhaps I'm
paranoid. Anyway, I would juat like to find the right venue to clean my
name or at least be allowed to try. If that venue exists at all, that is.

Personally, I feel extremely censored.
I also feel I've been judged unfairly and margibalized by many.
If it was because of my mistakes and not because jeremy and others lied
about me behind my back, well, I would like to know at least.

Am I really asking that much?
I'm surprised at how very few people are in favor of the american first
amendment, btw.

I know, I know. Offtopic. Everywhere. Every time.
If something it's offtopic everywhere, that's a censored taboo, I think.

Therefore I challenge to a public debate somewhere. For me to defend myself
and for him to defend himself too (if that's possible).
I know it's never going to happen, but I want to make sure it is known that
it is because of him, I'm more than ready to defend myself against him. Is
he?

He can call me a nazi and even though I'm not one (I'm not even racist), it
is not so easy to sue for defamation in international jurisdictions.
Imagine if I called him a pederast (kethuboth 11b, sanhesrin 69b) or a
cannibal (samhedrin 64a) without giving him a chance to defend himself.
Wouldn't that be nasty?
I want him to be able to defend himself too, or at least try it.

Now, moderators, censor this email for being offtopic and prove my point.
Jeremy will still get the email and I bet he won't want a public debate.
But I'm biased because I think he is guilty. Just like jeffrey epstein.
Is jeremy rubin a mossad agent?
Is there any reason to think so?
Or are these just rummors?
He should have a chance to try to clean his name, in my opinion. Again,
just like jeffrey epstein.

&gt;<i> Hi Tony,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a better place to have public communication? Unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> since one off topic email was sent here, it's been a ghost town. It appears
</I>&gt;<i> that there's many emails being held and only one moderator that checks them
</I>&gt;<i> once a week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I think you're referring to my post of March 21th and as the author of
</I>&gt;<i> this post, I'll politely refuse the qualification of &quot;off-topic&quot;. I had and
</I>&gt;<i> I still have the concerns of &quot;frivolous legal claims&quot; being used between
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoin developers/organizations provoking a distortion of the neutrality
</I>&gt;<i> of the development and a chilling effect of the technical discussions (i.e
</I>&gt;<i> code we compile and spec we implement). For those reasons, it was my legal
</I>&gt;<i> right and moral duty to inform the community of what is happening between
</I>&gt;<i> Chaincode and myself. And here I'm following the recommendation of one of
</I>&gt;<i> the moderators of the Lightning mailing list himself &quot;If this worries you
</I>&gt;<i> too, let's make sure we keep each other honest, OK?&quot; [0].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you think a group of people with open-source responsibilities are in
</I>&gt;<i> a situation of conflict of interests or &quot;moral hazards&quot;, or even the
</I>&gt;<i> appearance of them, you have the right to expose the wrongdoing, including
</I>&gt;<i> the _proportional_ revelation of private elements. People have done the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;free choice&quot; to conduct a career in open-source, for some even declaring
</I>&gt;<i> in some context to maintain integrity and accept their actions to be
</I>&gt;<i> submitted to external accountability [1]. While the exposure of private
</I>&gt;<i> elements of public personalities might break common courtesy, it's a
</I>&gt;<i> morally valid practice if you're familiar with the public institutions of
</I>&gt;<i> US and Europe, and I think this practice has found validity in the history
</I>&gt;<i> of open-source commons or IETF's protocol development [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond, the Bitcoin and Lightning development communication channels
</I>&gt;<i> constitute a public forum, where by nature the participants are exchanging
</I>&gt;<i> ideas and defending competing interests. In consequence, the participants'
</I>&gt;<i> rights and capabilities to contribute and speak their minds in those
</I>&gt;<i> communication channels should be protected. Those communication channels
</I>&gt;<i> are not your usual corporate workplace, and in case of conflicting
</I>&gt;<i> principles, the maintainers of those communication channels should ensure a
</I>&gt;<i> balance of rights and a proportionality in any restraining measure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And this new post is not to exonerate myself of any legal responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> for personal matters that could be recognized as the outcome of a judicial
</I>&gt;<i> process, respective of both rights of the accusation and rights of the
</I>&gt;<i> defense. Rather to enlighten the Bitcoin community that the formal
</I>&gt;<i> separation between private matters and open-source responsibilities, and
</I>&gt;<i> the adequate check-and-balances to guarantee this separation is somehow
</I>&gt;<i> what are the underlying stakes for this feud between Chaincode and myself,
</I>&gt;<i> from my perspective. I can say missing an open-source engineering meeting
</I>&gt;<i> or being revoked a few Github permissions matters far less than the clear
</I>&gt;<i> affirmation and respect of the freedom of expression, the presumption of
</I>&gt;<i> innocence and due process in the Bitcoin common space, all proportions
</I>&gt;<i> conserved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't blame any party involved in this issue, nor assign &quot;bad
</I>&gt;<i> intentions''. One position is really a function of your life experiences,
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of the legal and cultural framework and access to the factual
</I>&gt;<i> elements. As all human conflicts it is not binary rather &quot;grey&quot;. People can
</I>&gt;<i> be top executives at a billion-dollar company, having successful ventures
</I>&gt;<i> with hundreds of folks under management, or have a lot of responsibilities
</I>&gt;<i> for their relative young age, and still disagree on the set of legal and
</I>&gt;<i> moral principles to apply in the present case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, thanks to the Bitcoin friends who have reached out to call for
</I>&gt;<i> level-headedness and cool-mindness in the public discussion of this complex
</I>&gt;<i> topic. Like I said to them, in the lack of more suspected wrongdoing from
</I>&gt;<i> the other side, I won't communicate further on this subject on the Bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> and Lightning technical channels. However I still firmly believe the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on the principles, abstract in the maximum from its private
</I>&gt;<i> elements, should still be pursued on other channels. Independently, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a legal channel opened between Chaincode and myself and good progress is
</I>&gt;<i> made to find a serene and long-standing resolution to this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Antoine

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I joined the lightning community a few years ago, I was relatively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new to open source software and specification work. Rusty really impressed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on me on the importance of holding conversations, as much as possible in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Practically speaking, this encompasses IRC, this mailing list, and github
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues/PRs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reason for this is twofold.  It helps document the range of options
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered for technical decisions and it provides an interface point for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new participants to contribute to the discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given some recent mails that were posted to this list, now seems like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good time to reiterate the importance and preference of public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communication whenever possible, especially for specification or technical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussions.
