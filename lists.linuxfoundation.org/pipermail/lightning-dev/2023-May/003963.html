<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be very interested in how many repeat interactions nodes get from
</I>&gt;<i> individual senders, since that also tells us how much use we can get
</I>&gt;<i> out of local-only reputation based systems, and I wouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> surprised if, for large routing nodes, we have sufficient data for
</I>&gt;<i> them to make an informed decision, while the edges may be more
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable, but they'd also be used by way fewer senders, and the
</I>&gt;<i> impact of an attack would also be proportionally smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m unclear on what you mean by &#8220;individual senders&#8221; here? In our
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, nodes only track local reputation for their direct peers so
</I>&gt;<i> what matters is their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to
</I>&gt;<i> them (not whether they come from repeat senders).
</I>
Apologies, upon rethinking this I realized I had been mixing two different
proposals in my mind. The criticism of sender-based reputation does
not apply if all we do is track our immediate neighbors. Sorry for the
confusion.

&gt;<i> It&#8217;s true that nodes that forward fewer HTLCs are less likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes. In the
</I>&gt;<i> regular operation of the network, this should have low to no impact on
</I>&gt;<i> their activity - they don&#8217;t require much from their peers anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> During an attack, small and low activity nodes will temporarily be in
</I>&gt;<i> competition for large routing nodes&#8217; scarce liquidity and slots, but
</I>&gt;<i> will still be able to interact with similar nodes where they have
</I>&gt;<i> better chances of building a good reputation.
</I>
That matches my own interpretation very well, thanks.

Cheers,
Christian
