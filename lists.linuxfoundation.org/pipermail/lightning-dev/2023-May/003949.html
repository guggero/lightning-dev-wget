<PRE>Hi all,

&gt;<i> Some updates on channel jamming!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Next Call
</I>&gt;<i> - Monday 01 May @ 15:00 UTC
</I>&gt;<i> - <A HREF="https://meet.jit.si/UnjammingLN">https://meet.jit.si/UnjammingLN</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - Agenda: <A HREF="https://github.com/ClaraShk/LNJamming/issues/12">https://github.com/ClaraShk/LNJamming/issues/12</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Data Gathering
</I>&gt;<i> During these weekly calls, we've come to agreement that we would like
</I>&gt;<i> to gather data about the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation
</I>&gt;<i> tracking for jamming mitigation. A reminder of the full scheme is
</I>&gt;<i> included at the end of this email, and covered more verbosely in [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have a few goals in mind:
</I>&gt;<i> - Observe the effect of endorsement in the steady state with
</I>&gt;<i>   logging-only implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> - Gather real-world data for use in future simulation work.
</I>
There is anything that I can do to help here with lnmetrics tools?
With some guidance (because i lost the track of the situation here) I
can be able to deploy a metrics collector in production by the end of
May.

&gt;<i> - Experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The minimal changes required to add HTLC endorsement are outlined in [2].
</I>&gt;<i> Our suggestion is to start simple with a binary endorsement field. As
</I>&gt;<i> we learn more, we will be better equipped to understand whether a
</I>&gt;<i> more expressive value is required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> We'd be interested to hear whether there's any appetite to deploy using
</I>&gt;<i> an experimental TLV value?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Reputation Scheme
</I>&gt;<i> - Each node locally tracks the reputation of its direct neighbors.
</I>&gt;<i> - Each node allocates, per its risk tolerance:
</I>&gt;<i>   - A number of slots reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation
</I>&gt;<i>     peers.
</I>&gt;<i>   - A portion of liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high
</I>&gt;<i>     reputation peers.
</I>&gt;<i> - Forwarding of HTLCs:
</I>&gt;<i>   - If a HTLC is endorsed by a high reputation peer, it is forwarded
</I>&gt;<i>     as usual with endorsed = 1.
</I>&gt;<i>   - Otherwise, it is forwarded with endorsed = 0 if there are slots and
</I>&gt;<i>     liquidity available for unknown HTLCs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Endorsement and reputation are proposed as the first step in a two part
</I>&gt;<i> scheme for mitigating channel jamming:
</I>&gt;<i> - Reputation for slow jams which are easily detected as misbehavior.
</I>&gt;<i> - Unconditional fees for quick jams that are difficult to detect, as
</I>&gt;<i>   they can always fall under a target threshold.
</I>
Why not? I think this deserve a round on the real network also because
it is hard to simulat the real network imho, and I think
with some implementation like cln we can write an extention an deploy 
it in some nodes, I need to go deeper into it but I can help with this.

&gt;<i> Looking forward to discussing further in the upcoming call!
</I>
Unfortunatlly I ran out of routing here :) but I would love to discuss
how I can help with some implementation details.

Thanks to update in a very compact way what it is going on in the
Jamming mitigating meetins, it is helping a lot.

Cheers!

Vincent.
