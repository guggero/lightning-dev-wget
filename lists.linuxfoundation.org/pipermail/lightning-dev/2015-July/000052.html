<PRE>&gt;<i>As to BIP62 being out of date, can you point to specific things? They'll get fixed.
</I>Just one thing, actually. The &quot;Block validity&quot; section references
version 3 blocks, but those are already used by the BIP66 softfork.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment we have only the capability to push out one soft fork vote at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a time. The uncontroversial aspects of BIP62 were rushed out as BIP66 in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response to an undisclosed vulnerability, as mentioned. I believe there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus now that BIP65: CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY has higher deployment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> priority, so it will be next. There is no deployment timeline for BIP62
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because it is a low priority in this soft-fork logjam.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A slight clarification: we do have the capability to push out more than
</I>&gt;<i> one soft-fork *upgrade signaling* at a time, but this is very far from a
</I>&gt;<i> vote because if miners decide not to upgrade there is no easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> recover. The nVersion bits mechanism I co-authored with Pieter Wuille
</I>&gt;<i> and Gregory Maxwell is closer to a vote because a soft-fork failing to
</I>&gt;<i> go through has a clear and non-coercive outcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, if my own BIP65 had been accepted into v0.11.0 miners who
</I>&gt;<i> had upgraded to v0.10.x/0.9.5 would have been signaling that they
</I>&gt;<i> supported BIP66, while sumultaneously miners running v0.11.0 would be
</I>&gt;<i> signalling that they supported both BIP66 and BIP65. As adoption
</I>&gt;<i> increased BIP66 would trigger first, followed by BIP65. (theoretically
</I>&gt;<i> both could trigger on the same block too)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is if miners had decided they didn't like BIP66 but wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to implement BIP65 there would be no mechanism to do that - it depends
</I>&gt;<i> on the details, but from the point of view of at least some nodes you
</I>&gt;<i> likely would have hard-forked Bitcoin in the process of stopping the
</I>&gt;<i> failed soft-fork.
