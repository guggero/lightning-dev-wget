Hi Christopher,

The design of the HTLCs have a contestation period built-in where the
party which broadcasts the Commitment Transaction must wait a period of
time before the payment goes back to themselves.

I think your concern may have some implications for Rusty's dual
anchor/funding version. I had incorrectly stated that it might be
possible to do it only with OP_CLTV, but it clearly requires both
OP_CLTV and OP_CSV.

There's more information being attested when relying on OP_CSV for the
HTLC without a transaction chained 2 levels deep. It will require
greater time delay between each hop in the payment to account for the
relative time to prove whether the Commitment has been revoked. This
greater time creates a tradeoff which requires each channel participant
(for every hop) to watch the blockchain at a more frequent interval,
since that OP_CSV value is intrinsically linked to the payment.

With a SIGHASH_NOINPUT (or similar) model having transactions two-deep,
this contestation period can be independent of the actual HTLC payments.
In effect, the first transaction spending from the HTLC validates
whether the preimages are known, the second is whether the Commitment
itself is invalidated. With separated anchor/funding, those two steps
are combined inside the Commitment Transaction -- AFAIK, (minus the
above tradeoffs) it still works though, but I'll double-check.
