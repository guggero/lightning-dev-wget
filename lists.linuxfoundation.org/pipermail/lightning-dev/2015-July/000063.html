&gt;<i> Hey everybody,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently working on a Lightning Implementation Client/Server in
</I>&gt;<i> Java, building on bitcoinj (just as a basic framework, I wrote my own
</I>&gt;<i> classes to realize LN). Will push it into GitHub within a few weeks I
</I>&gt;<i> guess.
</I>
Hi Mats!

        Awesome, I look forward to brushing up my Java skills :)

&gt;<i> I had an implementation ready, that would not need any further changes
</I>&gt;<i> for bitcoin (works today already), but I just threw it all off the
</I>&gt;<i> ship, reading through your paper. It was based on some trust
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies and channel transactions were highly asynchronous,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that a LN-Network would not be possible (since one party will
</I>&gt;<i> always be assumed lower trust and therefore has a disadvantage in
</I>&gt;<i> enforcing the ruleset). I can share further details if there is any
</I>&gt;<i> interest (it further needed to exchange 3 transactions for each
</I>&gt;<i> payment in the channel, building up huge amount of data within a few
</I>&gt;<i> hundred payments....)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First I wanted to write up my solution for the anchor problem, but
</I>&gt;<i> then I realized, your solution makes it possible to have channels open
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely, while mine doesn't. And while it really looks fishy,
</I>&gt;<i> indefinite channels are really worth it. However, it is important to
</I>&gt;<i> wait for the anchor tx of the other party. Otherwise the server has to
</I>&gt;<i> pay transaction fees for releasing his funds again and again (which
</I>&gt;<i> can really add up..).
</I>
Yes, there's a delay waiting for the anchor(s) to be buried deep enough
to be considered irrevocable.  Also, if the anchors change, there's a
while where commitment txs need to be maintained for both the old and
new anchors.

&gt;<i> While implementing the new redeemscripts, I noticed there is no delay
</I>&gt;<i> for the 'HTLC Receiver Redeemscript', when redeeming the contract
</I>&gt;<i> using R. Doesn't this mean that revoked or not, if the receiver has R,
</I>&gt;<i> he can instantly claim these outputs. Let's assume a channel with 4
</I>&gt;<i> states:
</I>
Which paper are you reading?  The LN draft at lightning.network, or the
implementation paper at <A HREF="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/doc?">https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/doc?</A>

The rule is simple: any output condition which pays to &quot;self&quot; must be
delayed (so A's HTLC output to A must be delayed, similarly B's HTLC
output to B).

I didn't spell out all the cases in Figure 9, nor even in the Appendix.
I probably should, to make it clear...

&gt;<i> Really good work though, although I just had to delete and rewrite a
</I>&gt;<i> good share of my work. ;)
</I>
I know that feeling!  I just rewrote my test-cli utils to support dual
anchors...

Cheers,
Rusty.
