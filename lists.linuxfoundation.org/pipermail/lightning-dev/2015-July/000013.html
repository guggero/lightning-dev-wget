<PRE>&gt;<i>There is no such central processor though in this case to enforce the
</I>reputation of lightening nodes.

There's no reason why there couldn't be.

Tor, for example, has nine &quot;directory authorities.&quot; They attempt to reach
nodes in the Tor network, and record whether they're available. Then, they
vote among themselves to produce a directory consensus, and they all sign
it. Lightning could use a similar system. Unlike Tor, we don't need to
require everyone to use the same directory authorities, either.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blargh. The dumb solution here is to just shrug and say that you have to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-routing. That's pretty much equivalent to what would happen if one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the banks in the visa network had networking issues for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The big difference here though is that visa will kick you out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network if you're a bank that's consistently not meeting their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strict SLA's, and that keeps the network honest. There is no such central
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processor though in this case to enforce the reputation of lightening
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, C can just get the preimage from E and collude to steal the funds,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which is a nasty failure mode.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This scenario may even happen non-maliciously, if C has an honest outage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and attempts to pick up where it left off on each of its channels. To fix
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the non-malicious case, C could get a refund from E (a new signed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> transaction with a lower lock time), if C knows he has been offline for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> longer than B's willingness to wait before re-routing. But this isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perfect, or even good, because E cannot know that C isn't just trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> get a refund even though they have taken the payment from B. In fact, C is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> guaranteed the payment from B, since they have the pre-image.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Delaying the entire payment is a poor option; can anyone see a better
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Like you say, delaying the payment seems like a bad way to go, as then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the payments wouldn't be quite &quot;Lightning&quot; fast anymore. 99% of the payment
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could be re-routed though. Perhaps the 99% could be re-routed, while A
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> waits for C to rejoin. Or if multiple paths are being used to process the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> payment, just redistribute the remaining payments allotted for the broken
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> path among the other functioning paths.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The bigger problem here seems to be that the incentives are slightly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> skewed in favor of dishonestly. One can minimize the impact of that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dishonesty by breaking the payment into smaller chunks and across diverse
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> paths, but this comes at the cost of bandwidth and speed. Some sort of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rating system could come into play possibly, if nothing can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cryptographically worked out.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
