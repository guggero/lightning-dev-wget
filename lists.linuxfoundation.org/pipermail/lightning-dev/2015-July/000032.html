What sort of fee would this be? A percentage fee? A per-transaction fee? Both?

I can see a compelling case for any of the three.

</I>&gt;<i> Every physical hop in the Internet has related costs, e.g. in placing

</I>&gt;<i> ISP will just average out all the costs it has to make on its
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces, and present a fraction of that to each customer. At some
</I>&gt;<i> points in the middle between providers, there are places where both
</I>&gt;<i> sides have an equal interest in maintaining their link, and no fees are
</I>&gt;<i> charged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One major difference with the Internet is that we already have a
</I>&gt;<i> micro-transaction infrastructure in place, which is something the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet has never had (until now). This means it is possible to do
</I>&gt;<i> instant per-transaction payment of transaction fees. The fact that we
</I>&gt;<i> CAN do it doesn't mean we SHOULD, but I think there are advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> non-immediate payment models always require some form of trust from at
</I>&gt;<i> least one of the sides. Immediate payment of a transaction fee is as
</I>&gt;<i> simple as updating the micro-transaction channel with a slightly larger
</I>&gt;<i> amount than the to-be-forwarded transaction amount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An interesting question is whether nodes will be prepared to forward
</I>&gt;<i> payments at a net loss (the to-be-paid fee is higher than the
</I>&gt;<i> to-be-received fee); maybe they will, if they can compensate the losses
</I>&gt;<i> with higher profits on other transactions. Fee differences could play a
</I>&gt;<i> role in routing decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That brings me to another point: fees could be used as a way to
</I>&gt;<i> incentivize people to bring channels back to equilibrium. When a
</I>&gt;<i> channel's funds are almost fully assigned to one of its sides, further
</I>&gt;<i> payments towards that side become nearly impossible. Increasing fees in
</I>&gt;<i> that direction and decreasing fees in the opposite direction should
</I>&gt;<i> incentivize people to perform more transactions that bring the channel
</I>&gt;<i> back to equilibrium, and to perform less transactions that bring it
</I>&gt;<i> further out of equilibrium, or find alternative routes for those
</I>&gt;<i> transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could even offer negative fees for transactions that bring a channel
</I>&gt;<i> back to equilibrium. There could be a market for people making money
</I>&gt;<i> from bringing other peoples' channels back to equilibrium. This would
</I>&gt;<i> require either to step away from &quot;net neutrality&quot; (so, not the same fee
</I>&gt;<i> for every route / destination), or it would require some form of source
</I>&gt;<i> routing and explicitly setting the fees of intermediate nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My &quot;neutral meeting point&quot; routing design, which is effectively a
</I>&gt;<i> two-hop source routing, is already good enough: a node in the middle of
</I>&gt;<i> the network is advertising that it can benefit from a negative fee, and
</I>&gt;<i> it invites people to perform transactions and to share the profit. It
</I>&gt;<i> creates two routable addresses (one for the negative-fee interface (A)
</I>&gt;<i> and one for all other interfaces (B)). Other people can then perform a
</I>&gt;<i> payment-to-self, with payee side routing to A and payer-side routing to
</I>&gt;<i> B. Payee-side can then have a larger payment amount than payer-side, as
</I>&gt;<i> agreed with the meeting point, to transfer a part of the profit to the
</I>&gt;<i> person performing the transaction.
