A slight clarification: we do have the capability to push out more than
one soft-fork *upgrade signaling* at a time, but this is very far from a
vote because if miners decide not to upgrade there is no easy way to
recover. The nVersion bits mechanism I co-authored with Pieter Wuille
and Gregory Maxwell is closer to a vote because a soft-fork failing to
go through has a clear and non-coercive outcome.

For instance, if my own BIP65 had been accepted into v0.11.0 miners who
had upgraded to v0.10.x/0.9.5 would have been signaling that they
supported BIP66, while sumultaneously miners running v0.11.0 would be
signalling that they supported both BIP66 and BIP65. As adoption
increased BIP66 would trigger first, followed by BIP65. (theoretically
both could trigger on the same block too)

The problem is if miners had decided they didn't like BIP66 but wanted
to implement BIP65 there would be no mechanism to do that - it depends
on the details, but from the point of view of at least some nodes you
likely would have hard-forked Bitcoin in the process of stopping the
failed soft-fork.
