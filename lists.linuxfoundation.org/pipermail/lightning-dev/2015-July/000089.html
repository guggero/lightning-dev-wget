Yes, timestop would logically be a softfork add, and it should apply to
both (same logic applies).

&gt;<i> Speaking of being online all the time, checking the blockchain is

</I>
Outsourcability scales really well; once you're full-time monitoring the
blockchain, might as well get as many clients as possible.  You can also
automate the outsourcee's fee, by including it in the &quot;steal&quot; tx.

But I realized yesterday, outsourcing needs a new sighash op mode (or
normalized txids), so it's not really something to design a deployable
system around today.

Cheers,
Rusty.
