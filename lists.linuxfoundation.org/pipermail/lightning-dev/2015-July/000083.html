HTLC-TIMEOUT is an absolute time/block, not relative.  Thus
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is a noop for old HTLCs.

So, if A broadcasts, they need to wait &lt;DELAY&gt; to spend.  I don't think
I added anything new here?

&gt;<i> 2. Probably at the minimum doubles the HTLC timelock on LN payments. If
</I>&gt;<i> there is a minimum amount of time to wait to redeem funds (or receive a
</I>&gt;<i> refund), then the HTLC timeout must give you sufficient amount of time
</I>&gt;<i> to redeem as well. I suspect the amount of time necessary is about the
</I>&gt;<i> same since they're both dependent upon the estimated amount of time to

</I>&gt;<i> timeouts has some implications since it'll result in higher fees as a

</I>
Yes, the effective minimum HTLC-TIMEOUT is &quot;current-time + &lt;DELAY&gt;&quot;,
because if A broadcasts its commitment tx, the HTLC stays redeemable
until A spends it (which it can't do until after &lt;DELAY&gt;).

But it's not clear that this &quot;htlc timeout doubling&quot; applies to every
step on the route, it seems to just add one?

Or am I missing something else?

Cheers,
Rusty.
