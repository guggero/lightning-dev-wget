<PRE>Hi *,

For my own understanding I've been trying to work out what the lightning
protocol looks like at a network-protocol level. I think the following
works, maybe it's interesting for others:

For notational convenience I'm going to just list the secrets that need to
be known to use to spend an output. &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; are Alice and Bob's
respective keys, Alice_N and Bob_N are the Nth numbers in shachain
sequences [0]. I'm using TIMEOUT for the checktimelockverify construction;
DELAY for the checksequenceverify construction.

&#8203;Assume Alice and Bob already have a channel setup. Then their current
commitments might be:

Alice's commitment txn: (fully signed)
  500 Alice + DELAY | #Alice_101 + Bob
  500 Bob

Bob's commitment txn: (fully signed)
  500 Alice
  500 Bob + DELAY | #Bob_101 + Alice

Alice knows the hash of #Bob_101 and Bob knows the hash of #Alice_101
(because they've respectively seen the full txns to sign them).

If Alice wants to update the channel to reflect a conditional payment from
Bob once R is revealed, they can follow the following steps:

1) Alice proposes: (unsigned)
     500 Alice + DELAY | #Alice_102 + Bob
     400 Bob
     100 R + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT | #Alice_102 + Bob

     [1]

   Bob checks: txn structure, amounts, R, Bob key is correct
   Bob stores the hash of #Alice_102

2a) Bob declines; proposal never happened
2b) Bob approves, replies:
     signing Alice's proposal
     requesting sig of:
       500 Alice
       400 Bob + DELAY | #Bob_102 + Alice
       100 R + Alice | Bob + TIMEOUT + DELAY | #Bob_102 + Alice

    Alice checks: signature, txn structure, amounts, R, Alice key is correct
    Alice signs and stores new txn.
    Alice stores the hash of #Bob_102

3) Alice discards old commitment txn.
   Alice replies:
     signing Bob's transaction
     revealing Alice_101

    Bob checks: signature,
     Alice_101 hashes correctly (ie matches the hash of #Alice_101, stored
previously),
     Alice_101 forms hash chain with prior secrets (Alice_100, Alice_99..)
as expected

    Bob signs and stores his new commitment txn
    Bob discards the hash of #Alice_101.

4) Bob discards old commitment txn
   Bob replies:
     revealing Bob_101

    Alice checks:
     Bob_101 hashes correctly (ie #Bob_101 does clear the old txn),
     Bob_101 forms hash chain with prior secrets (Bob_100, Alice_99..) as
expected
    Alice discards the hash of #Bob_101

If the protocol follows through to completion, then they each have
matching, updated, signed commitment transactions; along with the secrets
necessary to void attempts to use older commitments. If the protocol goes
off track (checks fail, or no response from partner within a protocol
timeout), then either party can safely close the channel after any step:

 Alice can close at (500/500) up until step (3)
 Alice can close at (500/400/100) after step (2b)

 Bob can close at (500/500) up until step (4)
 Bob can close at (500/400/100) after step (3)

If Alice ever tries cheating, and publishes and old commitment:

  800 Alice + DELAY | #Alice_42 + Bob
  200 Bob

Then Bob needs to work out which of the 100 Alice_N hashes he knows or can
work out is being abused; prior to the DELAY expiring. With millions of
transactions that could be a bunch of hash calculations or a 100MB lookup
table. Might make more sense to have a dummy output of &quot;0: OP_RETURN 42&quot; to
make that calculation trivial though? That could trivially be verified as
part of the &quot;forms hash chain as expect&quot; and &quot;txn structure&quot; checks.

HTLCs are harder if you assume pay2scripthash is used though. If Alice
published:

  100 Alice + Delay | #Alice_55 + Bob
  100 Bob
  200 R1 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT1 | #Alice_55 + Bob
  200 R2 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT2 | #Alice_55 + Bob
  200 R3 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT3 | #Alice_55 + Bob
  200 R4 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT4 | #Alice_55 + Bob

well after R1..R4 were known and Alice_55 was revealed in order to try
stealing most of the channel's funds, I think Bob could only claim the
final outputs if he could unhash the scripts, which would require having
remembered R1..R4 even after those contracts had long been resolved. I
guess it could be feasible in that case to have the extra output be &quot;0:
OP_RETURN 42 #R1 #R2 #R3 #R4&quot;?

Cheers,
aj

&#8203;[0] It's easy to calculate Alice_N given Alice_M for some M &gt; N, but
unfeasible for any M &lt; N.

&#8203;[1] I don't understand the construction for HTLCs in 0.5.9 of the
lightning paper; what I'm doing instead is taking an underlying output of
&quot;Alice + R | Bob + TIMEOUT&quot; and mapping it through &quot;my key becomes my key +
DELAY&quot; + &quot;they get everything with my secret sequence and their key&quot;. I'll
post about that separately so it can get shot down :)

[2] (Unattached footnote) This project's motto is &quot;The lightning network:
it's off the chain!&quot; right?
