</I>
It might be millions.  What happens is Bob sees the anchor being spent,
checks if it's the latest commitment transaction.  It's not, so does a
backwards search to find the revocation key.

The time taken for that search is O(N), where N is the current
commitment transaction number.  But measurements on my laptop show that
1M transactions takes 5.4 seconds (see benchmark below), so I don't
think it's worth optimizing this &quot;never happens&quot; case.

&gt;<i> HTLCs are harder if you assume pay2scripthash is used though. If Alice
</I>&gt;<i> published:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   100 Alice + Delay | #Alice_55 + Bob
</I>&gt;<i>   100 Bob
</I>&gt;<i>   200 R1 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT1 | #Alice_55 + Bob
</I>&gt;<i>   200 R2 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT2 | #Alice_55 + Bob
</I>&gt;<i>   200 R3 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT3 | #Alice_55 + Bob
</I>&gt;<i>   200 R4 + Alice + DELAY | Bob + TIMEOUT4 | #Alice_55 + Bob
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> well after R1..R4 were known and Alice_55 was revealed in order to try
</I>&gt;<i> stealing most of the channel's funds, I think Bob could only claim the
</I>&gt;<i> final outputs if he could unhash the scripts, which would require having
</I>&gt;<i> remembered R1..R4 even after those contracts had long been resolved. I
</I>&gt;<i> guess it could be feasible in that case to have the extra output be &quot;0:
</I>&gt;<i> OP_RETURN 42 #R1 #R2 #R3 #R4&quot;?
</I>
Good point!  With p2sh you need to know the R hash values and timeouts
to spend the output (40 bytes).  Since OP_RETURN is length-limited to 80
bytes, you can't fit more than 2.

And if the HTLC outputs are not P2SH, they're non-standard and won't be
relayed.

What else can we come up with?

Thanks,
Rusty.

Err.... Yeah.  It's spelled &quot;caching layer for bitcoin&quot; but it's
pronounced just like that.
