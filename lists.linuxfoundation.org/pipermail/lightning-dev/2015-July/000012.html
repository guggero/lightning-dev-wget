<PRE>Blargh. The dumb solution here is to just shrug and say that you have to
trust these processors to be highly available, and never try to do
re-routing. That's pretty much equivalent to what would happen if one of
the banks in the visa network had networking issues for example.

The big difference here though is that visa will kick you out of the
network if you're a bank that's consistently not meeting their
strict SLA's, and that keeps the network honest. There is no such central
processor though in this case to enforce the reputation of lightening nodes.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This scenario may even happen non-maliciously, if C has an honest outage
</I>&gt;<i> and attempts to pick up where it left off on each of its channels. To fix
</I>&gt;<i> the non-malicious case, C could get a refund from E (a new signed
</I>&gt;<i> transaction with a lower lock time), if C knows he has been offline for
</I>&gt;<i> longer than B's willingness to wait before re-routing. But this isn't
</I>&gt;<i> perfect, or even good, because E cannot know that C isn't just trying to
</I>&gt;<i> get a refund even though they have taken the payment from B. In fact, C is
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed the payment from B, since they have the pre-image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Delaying the entire payment is a poor option; can anyone see a better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like you say, delaying the payment seems like a bad way to go, as then the
</I>&gt;<i> payments wouldn't be quite &quot;Lightning&quot; fast anymore. 99% of the payment
</I>&gt;<i> could be re-routed though. Perhaps the 99% could be re-routed, while A
</I>&gt;<i> waits for C to rejoin. Or if multiple paths are being used to process the
</I>&gt;<i> payment, just redistribute the remaining payments allotted for the broken
</I>&gt;<i> path among the other functioning paths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bigger problem here seems to be that the incentives are slightly
</I>&gt;<i> skewed in favor of dishonestly. One can minimize the impact of that
</I>&gt;<i> dishonesty by breaking the payment into smaller chunks and across diverse
</I>&gt;<i> paths, but this comes at the cost of bandwidth and speed. Some sort of a
</I>&gt;<i> rating system could come into play possibly, if nothing can be
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographically worked out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
