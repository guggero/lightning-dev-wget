Cool, I think this works.

Yeah non-cooperation risks in this model aren't that big of a deal,
because the channel is going to be closed out anyway if they're not
cooperative -- they could always refuse to route payments, and then
everyone's going to get their money back.

Yeah, there's likely some weird asymmetric economic incentive things
going on. If both channels are established with the same person, it
should be fairly clean, though. I think there will probably be some
measure of trust/reputation involved with pre-payment of the time-value
for the channel (shorter with OP_CSV, but still non-zero).

OP_CSV still requires BIP 62, though. It's possible to construct a model
with OP_CLTV without BIP 62 (described in a post earlier today) using
single-funder with some OP_CLTV'd output which returns the full balance
to the original funder at a date very far in the future after the
expiration of all Commitments and its dependent outputs.
