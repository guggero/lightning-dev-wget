</I>
Si!  As I said in a followup to CJP:

    It does follow logically: the node is given the next hop, the fee the
    transaction is prepared to pay there, and the time delta (eg. there must
    be 3 days left on the HTLC at that point).

    If it's expressed that way, there's no reason that &quot;next hop&quot; need be
    adjacent, right?

In fact, you can't really avoid them using intermediaries.

&gt;<i>    Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>     - does not let you avoid nodes
</I>&gt;<i>       + (NSA sets up a hub with negative fees in every direction, hubs
</I>&gt;<i> reroute everything though it to bump their fees)
</I>
Good point.  Especially if they're prepared to use very tight timing
(since the money is not important), so a node won't lose too much expiry
time on the HTLC.

&gt;<i>     - how to work out fees?
</I>&gt;<i>     - how to figure out how to route to other hubs you don't want to have a
</I>&gt;<i> direct channel with?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the latter two points have to be solved with some sort of global
</I>&gt;<i> (but not necessarily complete) routing announcement service, so you can
</I>&gt;<i> query who has channels and do cheapest path finding amongst them;
</I>&gt;<i> clients/leaf-nodes so they can estimate fees, hubs so they can do routing,
</I>&gt;<i> optimise fees, and work out profitable new channels to connect.
</I>
Agreed.  I think some dynamic routing protocol has to give you fees and
other info.  That's a fun, hard problem.

&gt;<i> Maybe that
</I>&gt;<i> can be derived from transactions on the blockchain though? But that's
</I>&gt;<i> already in the lightning paper.
</I>
Joseph half-seriously suggested that the anchor txs be open-kimono,
meaning that the routing info is on the blockchain already.  It's cute,
but since you need the dynamic info I'm not sure it saves anyyhing.

&gt;<i> Speaking of fees, I wonder if the &quot;fee proportional to satoshi-hours&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> backwards -- rather than saying &quot;the intermediary wants to charge for how
</I>&gt;<i> long finalisation takes&quot;, couldn't you just say &quot;the sender is willing to
</I>&gt;<i> pay inversely to how long finalisation takes&quot; in every case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm an intermediary, that works out as me being offered (F - k * t)
</I>&gt;<i> satoshi to deliver X satoshi within t seconds, for some F and k, then if I
</I>&gt;<i> want to take a cut of X*t*r to cover my costs, that just looks like me
</I>&gt;<i> onsending X satoshi plus a fee of up to (F - k * t - X*t*r) = (F - (k+X*r)
</I>&gt;<i> * t). If you can arrange that fee structure technically, a successful
</I>&gt;<i> transaction means everyone has an incentive to close the txn ASAP
</I>&gt;<i> (including the final recipient who receives the leftover fee as a
</I>&gt;<i> time-sensitive bonus). In that case you just want to choose r based on your
</I>&gt;<i> available funds in both directions, making it expensive when you're
</I>&gt;<i> over-committed, and potentially offering refunds (r&lt;0) when you're
</I>&gt;<i> unbalanced.
</I>
I think there's a natural bias to collect ASAP in every case, so I'm not
sure if further incentive there is required.

The problematic case is payment fail after timeout.  In a naive model,
if the payment succeeds (eventually), at least you get some money.  If
it fails, there's no transaction to skim the fees from.

&gt;<i> I think it's possible to cancel an unroutable transaction so that the funds
</I>&gt;<i> can be reused (by effectively routing back to the sender?); if it is,
</I>&gt;<i> nominating a smaller but still time-sensitive fee to have that happen
</I>&gt;<i> sooner rather than later might be good too. That could also be used to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a fee-enforced TTL; if the success fee is characterised by (F_1,
</I>&gt;<i> k_1) and the failure fee is (F_2, k_2), with F_1 &gt; F_2 and k_1 &gt; k_2 then
</I>&gt;<i> failing becomes more profitable than succeeding at t &gt; (F_1-F_2) /
</I>&gt;<i> (k_1-k_2). (F_2 &gt; F_1, failing is immediately better than succeeding; k_2 &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> k_1, failing never become a better option; when passing on fees, probably
</I>&gt;<i> would be clever to keep that time roughly constant, which is admittedly
</I>&gt;<i> straight-forward). That might be useful if you want the protocol to have
</I>&gt;<i> long timeouts for safety, but you want short timeouts in practice for
</I>&gt;<i> responsiveness.
</I>
The TTL in practice is the time difference each node wants for timeouts.
OP_CSV is cleverly implemented in terms of median blocktime, which makes
it less manipulable, but I wouldn't want to use a difference of less 1
hour per hop simply because there's a non-trivial chance of getting no
blocks for an hour.

&gt;<i> Offering an insufficient fee seems like it would easily render a
</I>&gt;<i> transaction unroutable; if one of the hubs is on a satellite or floating
</I>&gt;<i> platform for anonymity purposes, it might want massively high fees; if
</I>&gt;<i> onion routing is in place, this may only be discoverable mid-way through
</I>&gt;<i> the routing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you structure the transaction as &quot;&lt;Bob&gt; here's &lt;N-K*t&gt; satoshi, locked
</I>&gt;<i> with &lt;R&gt; to be revealed by &lt;Carol&gt; once you deliver &lt;M&gt; and as many of
</I>&gt;<i> those satoshi as possible to her&quot; with the actual payment Carol's expecting
</I>&gt;<i> not encoded anywhere other than (encrypted) in M, then if Bob tries taking
</I>&gt;<i> more fees than needed, he increases the risk Carol won't unlock R and he'll
</I>&gt;<i> get nothing.
</I>
No, I think fees need to be explicit.  &quot;I will pay you N satoshi to get
M satoshi to Carol&quot;.

&gt;<i> I don't quite see how channels can be safely used for independent
</I>&gt;<i> concurrent transactions though. If I (Bob) have an idle channel to Carol
</I>&gt;<i> for 100k satoshi, and I want to route 100 satoshi on behalf of Alice to
</I>&gt;<i> Dave (locked to R_1), and 200 satoshi from Anna to Doug (locked to R_2) and
</I>&gt;<i> 150 satoshi from Amelia to Drew through that channel simultaneously, how do
</I>&gt;<i> I sign things given that any combination of those transactions could fail,
</I>&gt;<i> breaking the potential &quot;chain&quot;? There's 7 scenarios that could happen then,
</I>&gt;<i> do I need to send potential transactions for all of them to Carol?
</I>
They become separate HTLCs.  That all works fine.

Cheers,
Rusty.
