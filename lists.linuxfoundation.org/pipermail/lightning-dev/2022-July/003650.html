<PRE>Hi Lisa,

&gt;<i> Adding a noticeable on-chain signal runs counter to the goal of the move
</I>&gt;<i> to taproot / gossip v2, which is to make lightning's onchain footprint
</I>&gt;<i> indistinguishable from any other onchain usage
</I>
My model of gossip v2 is something like:

  * there's no longer a 1:1 mapping of channels and UTXOs
  * verifiers don't actually care if the advertised UTXO is actually a
    channel or not
  * verifiers aren't watching the chain for spends, as channel
    advertisements expire after 2 weeks or w/e
  * there might be a degree of &quot;leverage&quot; allowing someone to advertise a 1
    BTC UTXO as having 10 BTC capacity (or w/e)

So in this model, splicing on the gossip network wouldn't really be an
explicit event. Since I'm free to advertise a series of channels that might
not actually exist, I can just say: ok, this set of 5 channels is now
actually 2 channels, and you can route a bit more over them. In this world,
re-organizing by a little corner of the channel graph isn't necessarily
tied to
making a series of on-chain transactions.

In the realm of the gossip network as it's defined today, the act of
splicing is already itself a noticeable chain signal: I see a channel close,
then another one advertised that uses that old channel as inputs, and the
closing and opening transactions are the same. As a result, for _public_
channels any of the chain signals I listed above don't actually give away
any additional information: splices are already identifiable (in theory).

I don't disagree that waiting N blocks is probably &quot;good enough&quot; for most
cases (ignoring block storms, rare long intervals between blocks, etc, etc).
Instead this is suggested in the spirit of a belt-and-suspenders approach:
if I can do something to make the signal 100% reliable, that doesn't add
extra bytes to the chain, and doesn't like additional information for public
channels (the only case where the message even matters), then why not?
