<PRE>Hi Bastien,

I vaguely remembered that the idea of inbound fees had been discussed
before. Before writing my post, I scanned through old ML posts and bolts
issues but couldn't find the discussion. Maybe it was part of a different
but related email or a bolts pr?

With regards to your objections, isn't it the case that it is always
possible to DoS your peer by just rejecting any forward that comes in from
them? Or indirectly affecting them negatively by setting high fees on all
outbound channels? To me it seems that there is nothing to lose by adding
inbound fees.

My thinking is that if I accept an incoming htlc, my local balance
increases on that incoming channel. My money gets locked up in a channel
that may or may not be interesting to me. Wouldn't it be fair to be
compensated for that?

Any thoughts from routing node operators would be welcome too (or links to
previous threads).

Joost

</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, you shouldn't care at all. If all the funds are on your peer's

</I>&gt;<i> Le ven. 1 juil. 2022 &#224; 13:10, Joost Jager &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">joost.jager at gmail.com</A>&gt; a
</I>&gt;<i> &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Path-finding algorithms that are currently in use generally don&#8217;t support
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> negative fees. But in this case, the sum of inbound and outbound fees is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still positive and therefore not a problem. If routing nodes set their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> policies accidentally or intentionally so that the sum of fees turns out
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> negative, senders can just round up to zero and find a path as normal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Correction to this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The sum of inbound and outbound are not the fees set by one single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routing node. When path-finding considers a candidate hop, this adds the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outbound fee of the &quot;from&quot; node and the inbound fee of the &quot;to&quot; node.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because those nodes don't necessarily coordinate fees, it may happen more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often that the fee goes negative. Rounding up to zero is still a quick fix
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and better than ignoring inbound fees completely.
