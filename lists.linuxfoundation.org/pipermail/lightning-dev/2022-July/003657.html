You're still thinking about this in a costing world, but this really is a networking problem, not a 
costing one.

&gt;<i> I'm not saying we should 100% compare onion messages to Tor, but that we might

</I>&gt;<i> aren't identical, but have some similarities.
</I>
To DoS here you have to have *very* asymmetric attack power - regular ol' invoice requests are 
trivial amounts of bandwidth, like, really, really trivial. Like, 1000x less bandwidth than an 
average ol' home node on a DOCSIS high-latency line with 20Mbps up has available. Closer to 
1,000,000x less if we're talking about &quot;real metal&quot;.

More importantly, Tor's current attack actually *isn't* a simple DoS attack. The attack there isn't 
relevant to onion messages at all, you're just throwing up roadblocks with nonsense here.


&gt;<i> On the topic of parameters across the network: could we end up in a scenario
</I>&gt;<i> where someone is doing like streaming payments for a live stream (or w/e),
</I>&gt;<i> ends up fetching a ton of invoices (actual traffic leading to payments), but
</I>&gt;<i> then ends up being erroneously rate limited by their peers? Assuming they
</I>&gt;<i> have 1 or 2 channels that have now all been clamped down, is waiting N
</I>&gt;<i> minutes (or w/e) their only option? If so then this might lead to their
</I>&gt;<i> livestream (data being transmitted elsewhere) being shut off. Oops, they just
</I>&gt;<i> missed the greatest World Cup goal in history!&#160; You had to be there, you had to
</I>&gt;<i> be there, you had to *be* there...
</I>
You're basically making a &quot;you had to have more inbound capacity&quot; argument, which, sure, yes, you 
do. Even better, though, onion messages are *cheap*, like absurdly cheap, so if you have enough 
inbound capacity you're almost certain to have enough inbound *network* capacity to handle some 
invoice requests, hell, they're a millionth the cost of the HTLCs you're about to receive 
anyway...this argument is just nonsense.


&gt;<i> Another question on my mind is: if this works really well for rate limiting of
</I>&gt;<i> onion messages, then why can't we use it for HTLCs as well?
</I>
We do? 400-some-odd HTLCs in flight at once is a *really* tight rate limit, even! Order of 
magnitudes tighter than onion message rate limits need to be :)
