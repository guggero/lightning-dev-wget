&gt;<i> Dear list, pardon me that I haven't investigated the Lightning implementations in depth yet, but one discussion has made me wonder how you approach the below described situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rene was talking about virtual channels in his article [1]. His motivation was that a company running multiple nodes has to open channels between its own nodes in order to transact between them.
</I>
Rene CC'd.

The issue with virtual channels is that we rely on proving that funding
transactions exist as a simple spam-prevention mechanism.  However,
that's just for gossip messages which advertize a public channel.

Two things to note:

1.  You can advertize anything you want in BOLT-11 `r` fields; this is
    the correct place for virtual channels, or private channels.  We
    might also allow some kind of local channel advertisements in the
    future.

2.  The advertisement of existence of a channel doesn't require its use.
    If you have a trust relationship you can just say &quot;please send this&quot;
    etc.

Hope that helps!
Rusty.

&gt;<i> My vision of LN was to allow for much heterogeneity. Not only a company should be able to transact between its own nodes, but also with other entities it has a trust relationship with. Let me give you an example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Say I trust you unconditionally. Alice asks me to send a satoshi to Bob. I don't have a channel with him, but you do. No channel between us. I receive HTLC from Alice, give you the image. You create HTLC with Bob, using that image. Bob checks - everything is OK. Bob executes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is source routing. Alice creates the whole payment chain, so she should be aware of our relationship. A solution could be advertising our trust as being a single node or introducing virtual channels as Rene suggests, constantly figuring out our respective balances. Is there a way to do so or do you see any other solution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the word 'trust' is repulsive, but think of the case with a single company running multiple nodes for whatever reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Dima
