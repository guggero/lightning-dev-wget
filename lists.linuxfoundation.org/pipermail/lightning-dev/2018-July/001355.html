<PRE>A simple way to see how rebalancing could be beneficial, is to observe that you only know the channel capacity (not the balance!) of the channels you don&#8217;t belong to.
If everybody is being good stewards and are rebalancing their channels, then picking a route to send a payment over is more likely to succeed than if everybody only has channels depleted in one direction (extreme case).

Hi Olaoluwa,

I&#185;m glad we&#185;re thinking the same direction.

Generally, I think we (the community) worry too much about equilibrium.
There is no really proof that it improves the network. On the other hand,
money being locked in channel is of major issue. Some nodes may be used
mostly for sending payments, whereas others mostly receiving. Therefore,
the distribution of funds in channels should be dictated not by
equilibrium but by nodes' plans to send and receive.

&gt;<i> In this case, equilibrium means being able to recv as much as you can
</I>&gt;<i>send on all your channels.
</I>
Now it seems there are two ways to define equilibrium. You have described
one where each node is trying to keep the ability to send and receive at
the same level. I&#185;ll repeat the above argument, some nodes may be used
mostly for sending payments, whereas others mostly receiving. Therefore,
such definition is unjustified from the individual viewpoint. Another
definition of equilibrium is when a node distributes equally the available
balance amongst the channels it has. Your argument still stands here as
such equilibrium minimises the number of depleted channels.

&gt;<i> The argument here is that by maintaining this balance, one is likely to
</I>&gt;<i>reduce the number of routing failures from failed HTLC forwarding, as the
</I>&gt;<i>channel is equally likely to be able to carry an HTLC in either direction.
</I>
If a node has no balance, its channels are depleted. There is nothing we
can do with this. Such nodes are bad for topology and should be
discouraged. Possibly by the autopilot.

&gt;<i> However if a few sources/sinks dominate, then channels may regularly
</I>&gt;<i>become biased requiring more maintenance.
</I>
Now you&#185;re bringing up even more important question. If we had balanced
payments, LN could function without touching blockchain ever again
indefinitely. Skewed traffic is a big problem. Re-balancing won&#185;t be of
use here because having a fixed nodes&#185; balances, there is only a limited
max flow that can be pushed in a particular direction. I believe autopilot
could mitigate the problem. Please, find my argument at the bottom of [1].

Subject: Re: [Lightning-dev] Rebalancing argument


Hi Dmytro,

Thanks for bringing this up! Sometime last year when I was at a developer
meetup that cdecker also attended, we briefly discussed a similar
question. We
we're discussing if &quot;active rebalancing&quot; was actually ever really
necessary.
&gt;<i>From my PoV, active rebalancing is rebalancing done for the purpose of
</I>being
able to send/recv a particular payment. On white board, cdecer sketched
out a
similar argument as to Lemma 2 in that paper you linked: namely that there
will
exist an alternative path, therefore active rebalancing isn't necessary.

IMO, in a world pre-AMP, it is indeed necessary. Consider a node Bob that
wishes to receive a payment of 0.5 BTC. Bob has two channels, one with 2
BTC
max capacity, and the other with 1 BTC max capacity. If channel 1 only has
0.2
available for him to receive, and channel 2 only has 0.3 available for him
to
receive, then without active rebalancing, he's unable to receive the
payment.
However, if he completes a circular payment from channel 1 to channel 2
(or the
other way around), then he's able to receive the payment (under ideal
conditions).

In a world post-AMP, then this would seem to no longer apply. Alice the
sender
may be able to utilize the aggregate bandwidth of the network to send
minimally
two payment flows (one 0.2 and one 0.3) to satisfy the payment. As a
result,
active rebalancing isn't needed as payments can be split up to fully
utilize
the payment bandwidth at both the sender and the receiver.

&gt;<i> total balances of nodes in the network define the feasibility of a
</I>&gt;<i>particular
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, not the distribution of balances.
</I>
With multi-path payments this is precisely the case!

However, there might be an argument in favor of &quot;passive rebalancing&quot;. I
define
passive rebalancing as rebalancing a node carries out independent of
needing to
send/receive payments themselves, in order to ensure an equilibrium state
amongst the available balances of their channels. In this case, equilibrium
means being able to recv as much as you can send on all your channels. The
argument here is that by maintaining this balance, one is likely to reduce
the
number of routing failures from failed HTLC forwarding, as the channel is
equally likely to be able to carry an HTLC in either direction.

One relevant detail w.r.t to the necessity of active rebalancing is the
directionality of payment flows in the network. If payment flows are more
or
less balanced (kinda like the ideal world Byran Vu describes in the post
[1]),
meaning people are sending out as much as they receive (so they get their
paycheck streamed to them over LN, then stream BitFlix w/ that), then it's
possible passive rebalancing isn't really necessary. However if a few
sources/sinks dominate, then channels may regularly become biased requiring
more maintenance.

Also thanks for bringing this paper to my attention! Haven't yet read it in
full yet, but happy to discover that this isn't completes new territory
and is
a problem that's been explored in the existing literature.

Hi everyone,

I have been working academically on the Lightning network for a while now.
I didn&#185;t not participate in the list to form my own vision of what it
should be. So please, bear with me if I&#185;ll be saying nonsense sometimes.

There has been a lot of discussion on sending cycle transactions to
oneself to &#338;re-balance&#185; the network. On LN mailing list
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/00">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/00</A>
1005.html&gt; [1] or numerous
places elsewhere. There has been even a paper suggesting a smart
mechanism to do the re-balancing (see Revive or Liquidity network [2]). My
question is what do we actually get from it? [3] states that the
distribution of funds in channels does not really affect
the network liquidity. I can see cheaper fees or shorter paths if the
network is kept balanced. But don&#185;t you think that a smart fee strategy
will do the job?

To save your time, [4] explains the gist from [3].
