<PRE>Hi, new guy here. I've also been a bit confused about the process from just 
reading the BOLTs.

I'm working on an implementation of the BOLTs with the intention of 
experimenting with new features.
My concerns are mainly about assignment of values for types and feature bits, 
and how we can test new features without conflicting with other developers. 

For example, looking at the current BOLT#9, it appears bits 8/9 are the next 
free bits available for use, so if I were implementing a new optional feature, 
I would pick the next available bits, 
however, I find that other developers have also opted to use the same bits: 
<A HREF="https://github.com/rgb-org/spec/blob/master/04-lightning-network.md">https://github.com/rgb-org/spec/blob/master/04-lightning-network.md</A>

I think issue of requiring centralized number assignment can be easily avoided 
for experimental features by using a unique identifier for the feature instead, 
such as a hash of the feature name. 
This should make it simpler for independent developers to try new features 
before creating new pull requests for a BOLT assignment.

Here's an extremely rough draft of the idea. The intent is that once an 
experiment has been tested and is succesful, it can move towards being 
standardized as a BOLT. Is it worth adding something like this?

--- BOLT #(-1): Experimental Features  [tentatively named]

Overview

The experimental features protocol is intended for testing protocol features 
which are not necessarily intended to become standard BOLTs.

* Lightning base protocol messages:

** experiment

A message for arbitrary protocol implementaion with a unique ID for each 
feature supported.

  type: &lt;??&gt;
  data:
    [32: experiment_name_hash]
    [2: payloadlen]
    [payloadlen: payload]

`experiment_name_hash` is be a SHA256 of the feature name, in ASCII, 
concatenated with a good source of randomness to avoid any conflict if any two 
developers chose the same name.

`payloadlen` is the length of the remaining message, which MUST equal the 
length of the outer message -34 bytes.

`payload` is the payload of the experiment message, which should have the same 
format as a regular Lightning message described in BOLT #1.

A sending node:
    - MUST send the `init_experiments` message with `experiment_name_hash` set 
to 0 before any other `experiment` message is sent.
    - MUST NOT send an experiment message with any non-zero 
`experiment_name_hash` if the receiver has not already declared support for 
the feature_hash.

A receiving node:
    - If experiment_name_hash is zero:
        - Treat the payload as the same format of lightning message, ie, a 16-
bit big endian experiment_type followed by the data.
    - If the experiment_name_hash is not recognized or disabled, MUST ignore 
the message. (SHOULD also fail the channels?)

Rationale:

The base lightning layer allows extension through feature bits and new odd 
message types, but these require centralized assignment by the Lightning 
community. 
This creates a chicken and egg problem for developers testing experimental 
features: In order to be assigned numbers, we need to standarize our feature 
through the BOLT process,
but we might not wish to attempt standardization until our experimental 
features have been tested. 
Without standardization, different teams working on different experimental 
features may cause conflicts if different clients are treating feature bits or 
message types differently.

By moving all experimental features to a new message where they are wrapped in 
a unique feature name, this eradicates chance of conflicting implementations.

Additionally, this message can serve as a generic transport mechanism between 
any two lightning nodes who have agreed to support the expierment_name_hash, 
as there is no restriction on the format of the payload. This may make it 
possible to serve e.g: HTTP over Lightning.


* General experiment messages:

If `experiment_name_hash` in the experiment message is 0, treat its payload as 
on of the following messages:

** init_experiments message

Informs a peer of features supported by the client.

  1. experiment_type: 16
  2. data:
      * [2: eflen]
      * [eflen*32: experiment_name_hashes]

A sending node:
   * MUST send the `init_experiments` message before any other `experiment` 
message for each connection.
   * SHOULD send the `experiment_name_hash` for any features supported and set 
to enabled in their software client.

A receiving node:
   * For each experiment_name_hash:
      * If the hash is unknown or 0: Ignore the feature
      * If the hash is known: SHOULD enable the feature for communication with 
this peer.

** experiment_error message

 experiment_type: 17
 data:
    [32: channel_id]
    [32: experiment_name_hash]
    [2: len]
    [len: data]

For all messages before funding_created: Must use temporary_channel_id in lieu 
of channel_id.

A sending node:
   * If error is critical, should also send the regular lightning `error` 
message from BOLT #1
   * If the error is not specific to any channel: set channel_id to 0.

A receiving node
   * If experiment_name_hash is unknown:
      - MUST fail the channel.
   * If channel_id is 0
      - MUST fail all the channels

Rationale

This message is not intended to replace `error` for criticial errors, but is 
provided for additional debugging information
related to the experimental feature being used. 
A client may decide whether or not it can recover from such errors 
individually per experimental feature, which may include aborting channels and 
the connection.

TODO: Define gossip/query messages related to nodes/channels which support 
features by experiment_hash_name.
