Hi Laolu!

        I consider that proof-of-payer, which would be great.
proof-of-payment (though ours is trivially forgable by the payee) is
useful for the common case of &quot;I paid, and you never shipped me my
widget!&quot; arguments (assuming description is invoice is useful, such as
containing shipping address).

Our network of early adopters with no significant malicious players will
not last, regrettably.

&gt;<i> Aside from that, spontaneous payments is amongst the most request feature
</I>&gt;<i> request I get from users and developers.
</I>
But they're terrible for anything but donations.  Businesses do *not*
want people to get into the habit of resuing old invoices (even if we
used dlog methods so it wasn't massively broken).

push-payments was one of the first support headaches we had at the
Blockstream Store, and I'm not eager to repeat it.  At least in that
case we knew where to return the funds!

To be clear: (opt-in) reusable invoices are vital.  But it's still part
of an 'invoice -&gt; pay' flow (though with the pay step repeated).

&gt;&gt;<i> And yeah, I called it Schnorr-Eltoonicorn not only because it's sooooo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pretty, but because actually capturing it will be a saga.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> eltoo won't be the end-all-be-all as it comes along with several tradeoffs,
</I>&gt;<i> like everything else does.
</I>
I somewhat agree that it has caveats, but it'll improve things
significantly against what we have today.

&gt;<i> Also, everything we can do with Schnorr, we can also do with ECDSA, but
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>
True.  But it should be much easier...

Cheers,
Rusty.
