BTW, my thinking was that we should add an optional funding tx + merkle
proof to channel_announce (or maybe a new channel_announce_with_proof
msg).  A node would use a feature bit to indicate it wants this.  Or we
could have a req/response for specific proofs.

We could also tunnel bitcoin block headers through the network, which
would also help lite nodes.

Cheers,
Rusty.
