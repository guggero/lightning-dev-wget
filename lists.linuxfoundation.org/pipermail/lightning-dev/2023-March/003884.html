<PRE>Hi,

This is unclear on which criterias the endorsement decision is made
&gt;<i>
</I>
A node endorses an HTLC if and only if it came from a neighbour that has
reputation 1 that endorsed it.


&gt;<i> Additionally, this is unclear how the available liquidity/slots on a given
</I>&gt;<i> outbound channel are initially distributed between all the inbound channels
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g proportional to the capacity) and how they're balanced once the
</I>&gt;<i> inbound channels start to accumulate reputation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The quotas are for any incoming HTLC that is either from a neighbour with
reputation 0, or is not endorsed. For each channel, the quotas
are independent of other channels and independent of the neighbour that
forwarded the HTLC.



&gt;<i> I don't know if this local reputation scheme precises how reputation is
</I>&gt;<i> slashed in case of HTLC failure, and if any &quot;grace&quot; amount/rate is granted
</I>&gt;<i> to the inbound channel counterparty, e.g Alice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Independently of those considerations, I think this local reputation
</I>&gt;<i> scheme might suffer from exploitable reputation asymmetries by a jamming
</I>&gt;<i> adversary.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say you have the topology:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice - Bob - Caroll - Dave
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice accumulated a reputation of 1 towards Bob and same for Bob towards
</I>&gt;<i> Caroll. As `fee_base_msat` Bob picked up 1000 msat and Caroll picked up
</I>&gt;<i> 2000 msat. If Alice forwards a HTLC to Bob and it is endorsed by him
</I>&gt;<i> before relay to Caroll, Alice can now inflict a 50 sat damage to Caroll,
</I>&gt;<i> while only encumbering the lower-priced reputational cost towards Bob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This concern could hold in case of asymmetries arising from the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> adjustment of routing fees during an evaluated period of time. E.g both Bob
</I>&gt;<i> and Caroll requires routing fees of 1000 msat. Alice builds up a reputation
</I>&gt;<i> of 1 towards Bob during this period N. At period N+1, Caroll bumps her
</I>&gt;<i> routing fees to 2000 msat. From now on, Alice can exploit this asymmetry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In general, if Bob is a low flow node (resulting in it having a low
threshold for reputation), he cannot have a high reputation with Carroll as
he will never forward enough. Taking into account the differences in fees
is interesting, but should be checked further.
