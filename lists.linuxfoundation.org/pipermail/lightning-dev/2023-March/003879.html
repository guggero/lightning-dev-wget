<PRE>&gt;<i> With a binary solution a single attacker can easily fill your quota of
</I>&gt;<i> low-confidence HTLCs and then all low-reputation nodes are blocked. But not
</I>&gt;<i> all of them are attackers, some of them just don't send you enough traffic
</I>&gt;<i> to get a high reputation for instance and you're going to block them too.
</I>&gt;<i> With a continuous solution you can differentiate between an active attacker
</I>&gt;<i> and someone who just sends to nodes with poor connectivity and only block
</I>&gt;<i> the first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If it's very cheap to behave like a neighbour with poor connectivity, why
wouldn't the attacker mimic this, and then block?
Differentiating between a potential attacker and just a low-traffic
neighbour is very difficult. I think that instead of &quot;low/high reputation&quot;
a better way to think about it is &quot;unknown/endorsed&quot;, and just consider
which neighbour needs access to all resources and which one doesn't.

The idea of different bins was brought up a few times and might help a bit,
but I am not sure at all that it is worth the complication.

For reporting c truthfully, if you report it too high you will be penalized
&gt;<i> by having your reputation lowered, if you report it too low you will
</I>&gt;<i> penalize your HTLCs and still get the same reputation as if you had
</I>&gt;<i> reported it truthfully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It might be that there is a strong motivation to underestimate than
overestimate. That is &#8211; the punishment for underestimating by X is
significantly smaller than for overestimating by X (or vice versa). The
formula you choose can affect this significantly.
