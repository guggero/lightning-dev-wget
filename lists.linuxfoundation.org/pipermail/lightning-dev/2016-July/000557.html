<PRE>Hi Christian, welcome to the mailing list!

Excellent work! I've been meaning to re-visit my implementation since I
finished it last October but have been busy tending to other lnd related
items.
Thanks for the cleanups and optimizations you've added to my initial Sphinx
implementation. Once we've finished fleshing out the initial specification,
I'd
be happy to get those changes merged!

I've taken a look at the diff against the existing implementation, plus the
current spec draft. I'd say the current spec draft is the *clearest*
description of Sphinx I've encountered, especially the padding bits. IMO,
the
notation within the paper describing how to construct+process the
mix-header is
rather opaque.

I see you've modified the encryption scheme of the end-to-end payload,
switching from the arbitrary block-size block cipher (LIONESS) to purely a
stream cipher (ChaCha20). Initially I was under the impression that this
might
compromise one of the security arguments of the scheme, but on closer
inspection this is perfectly fine if one extends the header MAC to the
entire
payload as you've done. If one was staying true to the original
construction,
then this would eliminate the possibility of Single-Use Reply Blocks
(SURB's)
since the sender would be unable to construct the reply mix-header as she
would
be unaware of they responder's message. It's clear to me now that a MAC
covering
the end-to-end payload was omitted in the original version since the proof
of
computational indistinguishability of replies vs responses depends on the
structure+processing being identical for both messages types. However I
don't
see us having any use for SURB's so this is an excellent change.
Additionally,
modifications to the end-to-end payload will instantly cause packet
corruption,
stopping invalid packets from propagating through the network.

I really like the addition of the per-hop payload! It's a change to the
original construction that I've seriously considered proposing. Such a
payload
should prove to be very useful in the future for information such as:
limits on
the per-hop absolute timeout, fee information, etc.

The addition of a version byte is also very welcome. This'll streamline
future
modifications we may make to the mix-header format in the future, such as
increasing the size of the per-hop payload, or switching to an alternative
format to encoding the &quot;next hop&quot; address.

The current draft doesn't specify the processor's action in the scenario
that
they're unable to locate the next hop node within their local routing table.
Just to be explicit, I think a final paragraph should be inserted under the
&quot;Packet Forwarding&quot; section detailing the abort procedure.


&gt;<i> However, they could easily be made variable should we decide that sending
</I>&gt;<i> mostly empty messages is wasteful.
</I>
I strongly think we should maintain the size uniformity of the packet
throughout processing, changes in payload size between hop can give away
information w.r.t a node's position within the route.

We might want to consider dropping the end-to-end payload altogether
though. I
can't really think of a clear use case for the e2e payload within our
specific
application.  That would save us 1k bytes, reducing the size of the full
mix-header to 1234 bytes. Accounting for the additional fields within an
HTLC
&quot;add&quot; message, plus some additional overhead, this should keep us below
typical
MTU sizes, avoiding fragmentation of HTLC &quot;add&quot; messages.

&gt;<i> This specification is limited to version 0 packets and the structure of
</I>&gt;<i> future version may change. The receiving node then splits the packet into
</I>its
&gt;<i> fields.
</I>
Packets with a non-zero version byte should be immediately rejected, as
well as
packets which aren't *exactly* 2258 bytes (or 1234 bytes if we drop the e2e
payload).

&gt;<i> The resulting HMAC is compared with the HMAC from the packet. Should the
</I>&gt;<i> computed HMAC and the HMAC from the packet differ then the node MUST abort
</I>&gt;<i> processing and report a route failure.
</I>
Perhaps we should explicitly specify that the HMAC equality check MUST be
performed without leaking timing information (constant time comparison)? I
can't think of a precise potential vulnerability otherwise since the scheme
uses an encrypt-then-MAC construction with a semantically secure encryption
scheme. I don't see any clear downsides in specifying that the comparison be
made in constant.

&gt;<i> The sender computes a route {n_1, ..., n_{r-1}, n_r}, where n_1 is a peer
</I>of
&gt;<i> the sender and n_r is the recipient.
</I>
In order to eliminate ambiguity, I think this should be more explicit,
specifying that &quot;n_1&quot; is a *direct neighbor* of the sender

&gt;<i> A special HMAC value of 20 0x00 bytes indicates that the currently
</I>&gt;<i> processing hop is the intended recipient and that the packet should not be
</I>&gt;<i> forwarded. At this point the end-to-end payload is fully decrypted and the
</I>&gt;<i> route has terminated.
</I>
It seems that with the current construction, then the &quot;next hop&quot; address
will
also be zero bytes if a packet processor is the last hop in the route.
Alternatively, if the sender is aware that the receiver is actually a
&quot;virtual
channel&quot;, then an additional address could be used instead of the
zero-address
to facilitate de-multiplexing at the last hop to the destination virtual
channel.

&gt;<i> In the pocessing phase the secret is the node's private key...
</I>
Typo here, it should read &quot;In the processing phase...&quot;

I think two key onion-routing related aspects are under specified within the
current draft: replay protection, and key rotation. Although we might want
to
place details concerning key rotation in a separate document covering the
initial routing protocol as the two are closely related.

First, lets talk replay protection. The current draft specifies that:

&gt;<i> The node MUST keep a log of previously used shared secrets. Should the
</I>shared
&gt;<i> secret already be in the log it MUST abort processing the packet and
</I>report a
&gt;<i> route failure, since this is likely a replay attack, otherwise the shared
</I>&gt;<i> secret is added to the log
</I>
This is definitely necessary, however as dictated this would require nodes
to
allocate a potentially *unbounded* amount of storage to the shared secret
&quot;seen&quot; log. I think we can allow nodes to periodically truncate this log by
adding an additional session time stamp to the mix-header, either placed
directly after the version byte, or within the per-hop payload.

With this absolute timestamp, each entry within the &quot;seen&quot; log becomes a
two-tuple: the shared secret itself, and the corresponding timestamp
specified
within the mix-header. Before the absolute timestamp has passed, the entry
within the log remains, and mix-headers received with duplicated shared
secret
are rejected. If we enforce an upper bound on the &quot;session lifetime&quot;, then
nodes can periodically prune this log, discarding obsolete shared secrets.
Once an entry has been pruned, although a node may not know if a shared
secret
is being duplicated, they can reject expired sessions according to the
timestamp achieving a similar affect.

Reasonable session times may be something around 30-minutes to an hour or
two.

With this scheme, I think that we can achieve near perfect replay protection
without unbounded storage.

On to the second aspect: key rotation. Ignoring the possible time-stamped
log
solution, the (possibly) only other way to allow nodes to prune their shared
secret log is to periodically rotate keys. Once a node rotates a key, it can
safely delete its *entire* previous shared secret log, as replay attacks
will
fail on the HMAC check. Independent of replay attack prevention, key
rotation
is useful in order to provide a degree of forward secrecy. Without key
rotation, when a node is compromised by the adversary (assuming the node
keeps
*all* prior mix-headers), the adversary learns of the next-node within the
route, and also the per-hop payload for the compromised node. With key
rotation, assuming the prior keys are deleted, then the adversary is only
able
to decrypt partially ciphertexts from the current epoch.

So then a question arises: how do we perform key rotation within the network
globally with loose synchronization? I say loose synchronization since if
rotations aren't synchronized to a degree, then the payments of source nodes
may fail as an intermediate hop is unable to process the packet since it
used an
obsolete onion key. Therefore published onion keys should come in pairs
(with
overlapping lifetimes), and also be authenticated by a node's identity key.

A key rotation scheme might look something like the following:
    * A node publishes two keys, along with a block hash of a block beyond a
      &quot;safe&quot; re-org distance, and a signature (under the identity pubkey)
      covering the advertisement.
    * The first key is intended for use until N blocks after the specified
      block hash, with nodes switching to the second key afterwards.
    * At the N/2 point, the original node publishes a new advertisement with
      the second key from the original advertisement listed as the &quot;first&quot;
key,
      and a new fresh quasi-ephemeral onion key. The original node performs
      this rotation at intervals at the mid-point of expiration of the
oldest
      key.
    * Nodes who receive this new advertisement (aware of the previous)
record
      this as the node's next rotation key. Nodes who receive this
      advertisement, unaware of the previous treat this as the node's
initial
      pair of quasi-ephemeral onion keys.

With this scheme, rotations are synchronized very loosely, perhaps in the
timespan of half-days, days, etc. There is a new cost however, when
processing
packets, a node must attempt to derive the shared secret with both active
onion
keys. Alternatively, instead of block hashes, we can use some other time
based
beacon as a switch over point in order to accommodate peers on multiple
blockchains.

I'll take a few more passes through the current draft spec, as well are your
commits in your fork of my original implementation, following up with any
other
questions/comments.
