<PRE>&gt;<i> Well one of 6, 36, 144, 432 or 1008 is probably more than enough choice.
</I>
Indeed, that seems entirely reasonable.

&gt;<i> Most of the time, local commitments are not in play.  But if your node
</I>&gt;<i> drops out, remote commitments definitely will be.
</I>
That's true, although in my experience, the refund delay after a local
commitment is often a period when the user may decide to do unexpected
things, because &quot;something went wrong and a reinstall may fix it&quot;.

&gt;<i> I think being able to rescue some funds from a pre-lightning wallet is a
</I>&gt;<i> nice thing to have at this stage.
</I>
Right, but it does introduce some uncertainty: depending on the exact
nature of the close, something may or may not appear in the user's
wallet. I think that would have been the correct approach for BOLT 1,
but now I'd favor a well designed recovery tool. Since the Electrum
team is working on LN, maybe we could get them to support this simple
heuristic?
