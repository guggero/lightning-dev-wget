<PRE>Hi Lloyd,

Glad you like it :) And to address your concern, I think that although
certainly it is possible for oracles to sell options contracts, it is also
possible to have a more decentralized setup with normal DLC oracles (that
can be used for all kinds of things as all they do is schnorr sign messages
with pre-commited R values), and then have the CETs be 3-of-3 multisig
outputs. In this way the oracle is still not learning about the contract,
just like normal DLCs.

Best,
Nadav

</I>&gt;<i> This is cool idea. I always imagined oracles would either give their DLC
</I>&gt;<i> signatures away for free or work via a subscription model.

</I>&gt;<i> The downside to this proposal is that the seller of the signature knows
</I>&gt;<i> which signature they're selling and therefore learns what kind of contract

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I recently posted a proposal here for a scheme through which a trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data provider can utilize the Lightning Network to privately sell data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where data is received atomically with purchase.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've more recently been thinking about situations where a party, that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *not* trusted, is attempting to sell its signature to a known message. One
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example of a situation where this would be useful is if someone is trying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to offer a DLC-like Option contract where they are essentially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collateralizing themselves in a funding transaction and then selling their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signatures to Contract Execution Transactions (CETs). In this example, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must ensure that the buyer of the signatures pays if and only if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receive valid signatures for the CETs which are known.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe that this is achievable in a relatively straightforward way if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we were to use ZmnSCPxj's proposed payment points with scalars (as opposed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to payment hashes with pre-images). The (Schnorr) signature seller could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give the buyer their one-time public key, `R = k*G`, through which the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buyer could compute the payment point whose scalar is the seller's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signature: `sig*G = R + h(m, R)*A` where `A` is the seller's public key.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using this value as the payment point, the buyer could be assured that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pay if and only if they receive `sig` from the seller, where `sig` is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> desired valid signature of `m`!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nadav
