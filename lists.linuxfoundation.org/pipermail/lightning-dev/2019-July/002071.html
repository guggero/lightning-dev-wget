<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Dear fellow BOLT devs,

in this mail I want to suggest a congestion and flow control mechanism to
improve the speed and reliability of multi path routing schemes. This is
the first of a couple of emails that I will write in the following weeks as
I have used my break in hospital not only to recover but to tinker quite
a bit about path finding and routing algorithms on the lightning network.

Problem statement
===============
Currently on the lightning network we have the issue of stuck payments [0].
As soon as an onion is sent it is out of the sender's control. This problem
seems to be in particular drastic if we wish to use Atomic Multi Path
routing [1] (which in the described form is not compatible with my
proposal. I believe my proposal should be compatible with the status quo of
base-AMP). The entire payments and HTLCs of a multipath payment will only
be settled once enough incoming HTLCs arrived at the recipient (meaning the
sum of amounts is bigger or equal to the amount specified in the invoice).
This has the following list of downsides:

- One malicious actor (who is just not forwarding the onion but also not
signaling an error) is enough to interrupt the entire payment process and
freeze all other HTLCs even of partial payments the actor is not part of.
- The entire payment process takes as long as `max_{p \in paths}(t(p))`
where `t(p)` is the time it took for path `p` to set up (and settle) HTLCs
- More HTLCs will be reserved by the network for a longer time. This means
more liquidity is bound / reserved and channels could even become unusable
if the 483 HTLC limit is reached.

Protocol Goals
===========
I looked at the windowing mechanism used in TCP to achieve congestion
control and transferred this concept to the setting of the Lightning
Network. This idea is motivated by the Spider Network paper [2] which
mentions that in a simulation the success rate of payments is increased
when changing the lightning network from a circuit switched payment process
(which we currently have with our atomicity requirements) to a packet
switched mechanism that includes congestion control (though in that
publication congestion control had a different semantics than in has in my
proposal).

Protocol Benefits
=============
- Improve the speed of multipath payments
- Reduce load from the network (in particular don't lock liquidity for such
a long time)
- less congestion at single nodes (I assume this is not a problem at this
point in time)
- more privacy (different preimages are used along different paths and
overall payments might become smaller or of uniform size)
- usual benefits from AMP

Protocol idea (base version)
=====================
Disclaimer: This base version has obvious drawbacks but I decided to
include it as it transports the idea.

A regular payment on the Lightning Network for amount `x` has a Payment
Hash `H` and a preimage `r`.  If a recipient would now accept that this
payment could be split over up to `n` paths the recipient would create a
sha-chain of preimages and payment hashes with `n` elements

```
r_0 = rand()
H_0 = H(r_0)
r_{i+1} = H_i
H_{i+1} = H(r_{i+1})
```

The payment process is initiated by the recipient providing H_{n-1} and
signaling (in the invoice) that up to `n` preimages are available to
complete this payment.

A sender can now decide to split the payment amount `x` into `n` seperate
payments for example of the amounts `x/n` though different splits should be
possible. Once the preimage of the first partial payment is returned the
payer learns the payment hash wich can be used for the next partial
payment. (One issue is that while we have a proof of payment we do not
necessarily have a proof of amount - which is true for the regular
lightning case though with a single atomic payment this is not an issue as
the preimage will not be relased if the amount is too low. We could avoid
this issue by demanding that mulipath payments have to be at least of size
`x/n`)

This protocol makes the AMP process sequential and reduces the load from
the network. Congestion (which is a local problem of routing nodes) becomes
less likely if only HTLCs are locked up for a partial payment independent
of the success or failure of other partial payments. However in the base
version there is a severe downside:

**Sequential payments will make the payment process even longer since it is
not the max time needed over all payments but the sum of times needed.**

We can resolve this issue by introducing flow control via a windowing
mechanism and allowing concurrency of partial payments

Protocol Overview (suggested version)
==============================
Let us assume the receiving node supports a window size of `s` concurrent
payments. Now the payee will not only create one sha-chain of `n` payment
hashes as in the base version but `s` sha-chains of `n` payment hashes.
In the invoice we would now transport the following data:

* `n` (we need a different letter as n is already taken) = amount of
partial payments that are supported per payment hash
* `s` = number of concurrent payments supported (window size)
* `s` many `p` fields which contain the `s` different top elements H_{n-1}
for each sha-chain

Note that technically the payment amount could now be even split up into
`s*n` partial payments though I would recommend to still go with `n`
partial payments.

The advantage with this mechanism are the following:
* As long as less then `s` payments get stuck the protocol can continue to
deliver partial payments.
* Nodes already agree to do some overpayments to obfuscate the payment
amount. If the stuck payments are really small they could be considered as
overpayments (in case they eventually go through). This would work if the
sender sends overall `n+k` payments where `k` is the number of currently
stuck payments.

Potential Improvements (for better privacy)
================================
* Instead of using a sha-chain we could xor every preimage with a sequence
number making it harder for an attacker to correlate two consecutive
payments in the stream of payments via
```
r_0=rand()
H_0(r_0)
r_{i+1} = H_0 ^ (i+1)
H_{i+1} = H(r_{i+1})
```
Instead of a sequence number we could also do something like `(i+1)*x` (as
attackers should not be aware of the overall payment amount it will be hard
to guess that number). I guess you folks are aware of much better
cryptographic tricks to achieve what I suggest here. So please take this
just as an idea from a beginner in cryptography.

* If paths are reused for partial payments the sender should switch to a
preimage from a different sha-chain creating some path decorellation
* Even when going away from hashedpreimages when changing to MuSig and
multilocks a mechanism similar to HD-wallets should be usable for this
scheme


Sender Requirements
=================
The sender needs to keep track how many payments have been successfully
sent and how many are in transition / stuck.
For the privacy parts the sender additionally needs to watch out to cycle
through the shachains when reusing paths

Receiver Requirements
==================
More data needs to be stored / held in memory. (either `s` complete
sha-chains) or the `s` times the initial preimage of each chain and the
current payment hash. in the later case the computational overhead will be
increased.

Conclusion
=========
* With introduction of two new fields in BOLT 11 invoices and rather simple
code changes for invoice creation / preimage releasing we have the ability
to introduce flow and congestion control to multipath routing of payments.
* The proposed mechanism is not atomic. It is possible that a payee
receives only a fraction of all payments and stops collaborating
* Less HTLCs and liquidity will be bound in multipath routing schemes
resulting in a reduction of load for the network
* A few stuck payments can be neglected as &quot;cost&quot; of operation. While I
strongly support ideas from [0] we might not need them with this simple
trick.
* As I used the term `stream of payments` in the text this mechanism could
also be extended for a streaming payments protocol.

I am curios on your thoughts.

With kind regards Rene
