<PRE>Hi all,

Eltoo has been criticized to lower the cost for a malicious party to
test your monitoring of the chain. If we're able to reintroduce some
form of punishment without breaking transaction symmetry that would be
great.

Transaction symmetry implies that we can't deduce from observing
txid which party broadcast a previous state. How to assign the
faulty broadcast to the right party to punish it in consequence ?
Thanks to taproot we have cheap witness asymmetry.
Witness asymmetry can be used as a way to force the broadcaster to reveal
a secret, and so committing thatn the transaction is the latest one.

If the party misbehaves, we wish to use the revealed secret to punish
him on a second stage transaction. Doing so would be really insecure
in case of reorg or even mempool monitoring by enabling a replay attack
of your committed secret on a lower state update tx. i.e Mallory
would counterfeit being Alice, and so enable the use of a punishment tx
against an honest peer.

To solve the assignment problem, we need to have per-update credentials,
a secret committed to a state number. You need a scheme were both your
highest credential can't be used against you while at the same time if some
attacker broadcast a transaction with a lower credential you are able to
punish him.

How to make Bitcoin Script aware of a secret committed to
a lower state number ? To do so, we may use some SIGHASH magic, if you sign
two messages with the same key and we can be sure thatn the only difference
between
them is the nLocktime (encoding the state-number in eltoo), that means you
tried to breach the contract.

Without access to arbitrary messages on the stack, the only messages we can
enforce signatures on are Bitcoin transactions. We force a party
broadcasting an Update tx to sign it with
SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTSCRIPT|SIGHASH_NONE|SIGHASH_SINGLE. If someone can shows
a
Litigation Tx with a higher state than the Update, we know that this one
has
been revoked, and someone is cheating among channel parties. We enter in a
Litigation phase, the Settlement Tx will be encumbered by a Challenge Tx
against
which you will need to produce a signature with the same SIGHASH flags as
the Update Tx.,
The only difference will be the nLocktime inherited from Litigation.

Assume Alice is trying to cheat, now Bob can take the signature from her
broadcast Update tx
and Alice&#8217;s signature on the Challenge tx, pass it as witness to a script
verifying their validity
and identity. If their validity is true and identity is false, you can
spend with a Justice tx,
splitting Alice&#8217;s funds between the other parties. If validity is true and
identity is true, then the script should fail. After timelock expiration,
if no one has proven Alice misbehaved,
she can redeem her funds.

Eltoo-Penalty Transaction Tree
==============================




                               Friendly Settlement Tx
                Challenge Tx -- Justice Tx
                                 /
                          /
                                /
                       /
Funding-Output -- Update Tx -- Litigation Tx -- .. -- Hostile Settlement Tx
--  Challenge Tx -- Justice Tx

                      \

                       \  Challenge Tx -- Justice Tx

(I've omitted chaperon signatures)

]

UPDATE TX:
nLocktime: 500e6 + n
output 0:
P = muSig(A,B,C)
scripts = [
&quot;OP_1 CHECKSIGVERIFY&quot; (friendly settlement script path)
&quot;OP_1 CHECKSGIVERIFY 500e6+n OP_CLTV OP_DROP&quot; (litigation script path)

&quot;sig(A, hash_type=SINGLE|ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT|NONE) sig(P,

&quot;sig(B, hash_type=SINGLE|ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT|NONE) sig(P,
hash_type=SINGLE)&quot;  (Bob commitment signature)
&quot;sig(C, hash_type=SINGLE|ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT|NONE) sig(P,

&quot;OP_1 CHECKSIG&quot; (litigation script path)
&quot;OP_1 CHECKSIGVERIFY&quot; (hostile settlement script path)

&quot;sig(P, hash_type=SINGLE|ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT)

P = muSig(A,B,C)
scripts = [
&quot;OP_1 CHECHSIGVERIFY &lt;Alice_key&gt; CHECKSIGVERIFY 500e6n OP_CLTV OP_DROP&quot;
(Alice challenge script path)
]
output 1: (to_Bob)
P = muSig(A,B,C)

&quot;OP_1 CHECHSIGVERIFY &lt;Bob_key&gt; CHECKSIGVERIFY 500e6n OP_CLTV OP_DROP&quot; (Bob

&quot;OP_1 CHECHSIGVERIFY &lt;Caroll_key&gt; CHECKSIGVERIFY 500e6n OP_CLTV OP_DROP&quot;
(Caroll challenge script path)

    OP_EQUAL OP_NOT OP_VERIFY&quot;  (proof-of-Alice-fraud script path)
&quot;&lt;n&gt; OP_CSV &lt;Alice refund_key&gt; (refund Alice script path)
]

output 0: (to_Caroll)
output 1: (to_Bob)
witness:
&quot;sig_Alice_from_update_tx sig_Alice_from_challenge_tx sig(P, hash_type=ALL)&quot;


State Update
============

Alice, Bob and Caroll build new friendly Settlement tx N, new Update Tx and
revoke old one by
generating a Justice tx with state higher than the previous one, a hostile
Settlement tx plus
Y challenge txn and Y justice txn with Y number of parties.

Cooperative Case
================

After X updates, Alice, Bob, Caroll, cooperate to closing transaction using
key path
spending of funding Taproot output, the spending transactions contains
accurate balances.

Unilateral Case
================

After X updates, Alice broadcast the last Update tx N, by signing it with
her private key with
SIGHASH_NONE,SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT,SIGHASH_SINGLE and use MuSig
previously distributed
between parties at state update. Her signature doesn't protect anything
except commitment to
the latest state number.

After finalization of the friendly settlement tx, she can redeem her
balance, and timeout/fulfill
her outputs.

If she has broadcast the latest state, none of the parties should be able
to broadcast a Litigation
tx with a highest state number. Her signature committing to the locktime,
no one is able to
counterfeit her identity by spending the funding taproot output with a
lowest update tx.

Malicious Case
==============

Bob is broadcasting a lowest Update tx with his signature committing to it.
Alice use Litigation tx
to spend it, if anyone has a highest Litigation tx, he can use it. After
Litigation tx finalization,
hostile settlement transaction is used. Each output returning to a channel
party, is encumbered
by a &quot;challenge&quot;. To unlock your funds, you must provide a signature
against same pubkey and same
SIGHASH flags than the one encumbering your tapscript for funding output.

Challenge tx is using a taproot output, one leaf returning fund to Alice
after some timelock,
The other one, let anyone with a MuSig and two valid signatures committing
to different nLocktime
to send challenged fund to a Justice tx, doing an equal split between other
channel parties.

You need signatures to be safe against third-party malleability, i.e being
able to tweak
your signatures to be still valid but diff being interpreted as a proof of
commitment on lowest state number. On the Justice tx, you need a new key
type to enforce that every signature must have sighash
SIGHASH_MASKLOCKTIMEWITH, where you expect the signature to be followed by
the state number which is going to be used as locktime in transaction
digest algorithm. So in this way state number are provided in witness and
you can equivocate Justice tx as both revoked Update Tx and Challenge Tx.

Okay, I'm quite sure that Script gurus on this list are going to point
flaws of this scheme.
It's more a thought experiment and I was curious if anyone has other ideas
to get Eltoo + penalties,
if yes let it know !
