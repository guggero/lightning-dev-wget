As long as there's no conflict created by using both relative and
absolute locktimes in the same transaction, I don't think there's any
problem.  Multiple versions of a commitment transaction may be signed,
each with different nLockTimes but all other parts of the transaction
the same (including any relative timelocks).  This obviously requires a
tiny bit of extra CPU plus modest amounts of extra bandwidth and
storage, but it seems within reason for people who want better privacy.

</I>&gt;<i> Then we would hide the Lightning relative-locktime transactions with an `nLockTime` of 0.
</I>
Commitment transactions for current two-party LN have at least two
outputs; the chance of both outputs being spent with an nLockTime of 0
is 25% (assuming every non-LN onchain transaction uses the above
scheme).  That's a fairly significant bias that can be combined with
other indicators to identify LN transactions for analytics or censorship.
