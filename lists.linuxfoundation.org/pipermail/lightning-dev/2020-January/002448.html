<PRE>Hi all,

At present, BOLT-3 commitment transactions provide a two-layer
pay-to-self path, so that you can reduce the three options:

  1) pay-to-them due to revoked commitment
  2) pay-to-me due to timeout (or: preimage known)
  3) pay-to-them due to preimage known (or: timeout)

to just the two options:

  1) pay-to-them due to revoked commitment
  2) pay-to-me due to timeout (or: preimage known)

This allows the `to_self_delay` and the HTLC timeout (and hence the
`cltv_expiry_delta`) to be chosen independently.

As it stands, both the original eltoo proposal [0] and the
ANYPREVOUT-based sketch [1] don't have this property, which means that
either the `cltv_expiry_delta` needs to take the `to_self_delay` into
account, or you risk not being able to claim funds to cover payments
you forward.

[0] <A HREF="https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf">https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf</A>
[1] <A HREF="../2019-May/001996.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-May/001996.html</A>

I think if we drop the commitment to the input value from
ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT signatures, it's possible to come up with a scheme
that preserves the other benefits of eltoo while also having the same
benefits BOLT-3 currently achieves. I think for eltoo it needs to be a
channel-wide &quot;shared_delay&quot; rather than a &quot;to_self&quot; delay, so I'll use
that.

Here's the setup. We have four types of transaction:

 * funding transaction, posted on-chain as part of channel setup
 * update transaction, posted on-chain to close the channel at a
   given state
 * revocable claim transaction, posted on-chain to reveal a preimage
   or establish a timeout has passed
 * settlement transaction, to actually claim funds

As with eltoo, if a stale update transaction is posted, it can be spent
via any subsequent update transaction with no penalty. The revocable
claim transactions have roughly the same goal as the second layer BOLT-3
transactions, that is going from:

  1) spent by a later update transaction
  2) pay-to-me due to timeout (or: preimage known)
  3) pay-to-them due to preimage known (or: timeout)

to

  1) spent by a later update transaction
  2) pay-to-me due to timeout (or: preimage known)

In detail:

 * Get a pubkey from each peer (A, B), and calculate P=MuSig(A,B).

 * Each state update involves constructing and calculating signatures
   for new update transactions, revocable claim transactions and
   settlement transactions.

 * The update transaction has k+2 outputs, where k is the number of open
   PTLCs. Each PTLC output pays to P as the internal key, and:

     IF CODESEP [i] ELSE [500e6+n+1] CLTV ENDIF DROP OP_1 CHECKSIG

   as the script. i varies from 1..k; n is the state counter, starting
   at 1 and counting up.

   Each balance output pays to P as the internal key and:

     IF CODESEP IF [balance_pubkey_n] [shared_delay] CSV ELSE OP_1 OP_0 ENDIF
     ELSE OP_1 [500e6+n+1] CLTV ENDIF 
     DROP CHECKSIG

   as the script.

   The signature that allows an update tx to spend a previous update tx
   is calculated using ALL|ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT, a locktime of 500e6+n,
   with the key P, and codesep_pos=0xffff_ffff.

 * For each output of the update tx and each party that can spend it,
   we also construct a revocable claim transaction. These are designed
   to update a single output of each PTLC, and their output pays to P
   as the internal key, and the script:

     IF [i*P+p] CODESEP ELSE [500e6+n+1] CLTV ENDIF DROP OP_1 CHECKSIG

   (swapping the position of the CODESEP opcode, and encoding both i and
   p in the script -- P is the number of peers in the channel, so 2
   here, and p is an identifier for each peer so either 0 or 1; i=1..k
   for HTLCs, i=0 for the balances)

   The signature that allows this tx to be applied to the update tx
   is calculated as SINGLE|ANYPREVOUT, with the script committed and
   codesep_pos=1. This signature should be made conditional for each
   PTLC, either by being an adaptor signature requiring the point preimage
   to be added, or by having a locktime given.

 * For each revocable claim transaction, we also construct a settlement
   transaction. The outputs of the settlement transactions are just
   an address for whichever peer receives the funds.

   These are also done by SINGLE|ANYPREVOUT signatures, with nSequence
   set to the shared_delay. There's no locktime or adaptor signatures
   needed here, since they were taken care of for the revocable claim
   transaction.  The signatures commit to the respective scripts, and
   set codesep_pos to either 1 or 2 depending on whether a revocable
   claim is being spent or not.

 * The funding transaction pays to internal key P, with tapscript:

     &quot;OP_1 CHECKSIGVERIFY 500e6 CLTV&quot;

Then: to spend from the funding transaction cooperatively, you make a
new SIGHASH_ALL signature based the output key Q for the funding tx.

If you can't do that, you post two transactions: the latest update tx,
and another tx that includes any revocable claim tx's you can already
claim and an input to cover fees, and any change from the fees. You then
wait for the shared_delay to pass, and can then use the settlement txs
to finish claiming the funds, and do whatever you like afterwards.

If someone else posts an update tx, and you have a later one, then
you construct a new update tx, with an input for each unspent output
(whether directly from the update tx, or from a revocable claim tx),
with the witness for each being the update tx's ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT
signature (and a &quot;0&quot; to choose the right path of the IF). You then post
that, and another tx that includes your revocable claims txs and pays
the fees, and continue as before.

If someone else posts the latest update tx, you can post any revocable
claims you have to lock those funds in, then need to just wait for the
shared_delay to pass, so that you can claim your balance and post and
settlement txs you have. If you'd had a bad crash and lost the current
channel state, you can work out which output is your balance, and claim
it using just your private key, however you'll lose any PTLCs you may
have otherwise been able to claim.

There's &quot;only&quot; 1+2*(P+2*k) signatures that need to be calculated for
each state -- 1 for the update transaction, and 2 (revocable commit and
settlement) for each of the P balances and both of the ways (preimage
reveal and timeout) each of the k PTLCs can be claimed.


I think you can distinguish each signature so it's only used for the
appropriate transaction,

 -&gt; update sig has codesep_pos=0xffff_ffff which forces the CLTV path
    to be taken, and nLockTime set so it's only valid for earlier
    updates' scripts

 -&gt; revocable claim sig has codesep_pos=1 and commits to the script
    which encodes by the state n and either the HTLC index i, or the
    balance's owner's pubkey

 -&gt; settlement sig has codesep_pos=2 and commits to the script, which
    encodes the state n, the HTLC index i, and the peer who claimed the
    funds

This doesn't work well with HTLCs because you'd need to encode the HTLC
in script, which means you need to keep a record of every HTLC hash in
case it appears in an old published update tx that you want to update
to a new update transaction. I think more generally it's only compatible
with contracts that can be encoded in a scriptless script, as otherwise
you'd need to remember the contract details in perpetuity in case an old
state was published that you needed to update. I think deferring the
contract details to settlement would solve the revocable part of the
problem, but would bring back the delay/locktime conflict so doesn't
seem helpful.

This should work fine with the &quot;A CHECKSIGVERIFY B CHECKSIG&quot; alternate
scripts mentioned in [2] for shortcutting roundtrips, though having more
than one script path would make every uncooperative close more expensive
than only having one script path.

[2] <A HREF="../2019-December/002385.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-December/002385.html</A>

I think this construction generalises fine to multiparty channels,
though maybe there are cheaper ones for two-party channels which might
be worth optimising for. I think the obvious optimisations to two-party
channels fail if you bring in untrusted watchtowers -- though that might
be fixable if you make it so watchtowers get signatures that apply
against earlier update tx's but not the funding tx -- I think that'd
just require calculating an extra signature per state.

It's a pretty artificial structure all round, so definitely gives away
that eltoo is in use as soon as an uncooperative close starts, and
also gives away the number of participants in the channel (because the
balance outputs are distinguishable in order to allow balance recovery
after loss of state info).


This all only works if ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT doesn't commit to the value of
the input -- otherwise reusing the single &quot;update&quot; signature won't allow
you to collect every revocable claim tx output back to redistribute all
their funds correctly. That's a significant change to NOINPUT/BIP 118 as
it stands.

Cheers,
aj
