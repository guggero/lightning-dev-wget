<PRE>Good morning David,

</I>
Unfortunately it does not quite work to have a transaction with *both* non-zero `nLockTime` and relative-locktime `nSequence`.

For `nLockTime`-only (no relative locktime, i.e. all `nSequence` is 0xFFFFFFE), these are used in HTLC / PTLC contracts.
The beneficiary of the timelock branch of the HTLC/PTLC will publish it at around the `nLockTime`, which matches with the behavior that Bitcoin Core will produce.

For `nSequence` relative-locktime transactions that protect the security of the channel mechanism, these are used in unilateral closes.
The issue is that a unilateral close might occur far, far in the future.
Thus, any non-0 `nLockTime` you signed up for at the time the commitment transaction was signed, will likely be obsolete.

Instead, what Bitcoin Core would have to do would be something like:

* Toss a coin:
  * If it is heads, use a non-relative-locktime `nSequence` and an `nLockTime` of the next block (i.e. current behavior).
  * If it is tails, use a relative-locktime `nSequence` equal to the confirmations of the output being spent, and an `nLockTime` of 0.

Then we would hide the Lightning relative-locktime transactions with an `nLockTime` of 0.

Note that `nLockTime` transactions can be used in general as a backoff for cooperative protocols such as CoinSwap.
I allude to this use here: <A HREF="https://github.com/AdamISZ/CoinSwapCS/issues/53">https://github.com/AdamISZ/CoinSwapCS/issues/53</A>
Thus we expect that there will be more users of `nLockTime`d transactions than relative-timelock `nSequence` transactions.
It might be wise to bias the above coin towards using the relative-locktime `nSequence` more often than the `nLockTime`.

As far as I can tell, relative-locktime is most often used for unlimited-lifetime offchain updateable mechanisms, of which Lightning Poon-Dryja, Decker-Wattenhofer, and &quot;eltoo&quot; Decker-Russell-Osuntokun are the examples most readily available from my cortex-analogue.
All intra-chain swaps (submarine swaps, CoinSwap, Lightning multi-hop routing) should use absolute-locktime, and can be optimized to some extent by use of `nLockTime` ordinary spends.

ZmnSCPxj
