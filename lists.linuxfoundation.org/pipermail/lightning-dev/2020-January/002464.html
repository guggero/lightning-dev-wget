<PRE>Good morning Matt,

Thread-hijack...

&gt;<i> route-hijacks (aka someone providing routing for a lower fee
</I>&gt;<i> and users happily taking it)
</I>
I observe that this is something of a catch-22.

If users *notice* lower fees and go to lower-fee channels, then route-hijacking is possible and surveillors can pay (via sacrificed fees) for better surveillance.
If users *ignore* lower fees, then forwarding nodes will jack up their prices to 21 million Bitcoin `fee_base`, because users are going to go through their nodes with equal probability as lower-priced nodes.

In many ways, traits that make one a good forwarding node (large number of channels, cheap fees, central location, high uptime, low latency...) also makes one a good surveillance node, sigh.
Fortunately this second-layer Lightning network remains censorship-resistant (censorship leads to loss of profit from fees, same as on the blockchain layer, and censors can be evicted by jacking up your willingness to pay fees (including onchain fees to move your channels away from the censoring node and towards the node you want to pay to, which again is an eviction of the censor), just as effectively as on the blockchain layer).

&gt;<i> in the routing DB today. The issue of
</I>&gt;<i> anti-DoS is somewhat different - we do have reasonable protection from
</I>&gt;<i> someone OOM'ing every node on the network by opening a billion channels.
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-DoS could reasonably be accomplished with simple equivalent proofs,
</I>&gt;<i> though of course they would be somewhat more expensive to create/validate.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So introducing proof of knowledge of fund locked instead of revealing the amount of fund locked by counterparties will introduce added complexity while routing but how effective is this going to be against handling attacks like hijacking of routes and channel exhaustion ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The added complexity is spam-prevention, as mentioned, and not routing in particular.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pathfinding algorithms can just use the lower limit of the rangeproof to filter out channels too small to pass a particular payment through, C-Lightning (and probably other implementations) already does this, using the known channel capacity as the limit (knowledge of the exact channel capacity is a rangeproof whose lower limit equals the upper limit, yes?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, since the proofs involved are likely to be larger than just a simple 64-bit integer that indicates the location of the funding transaction on the blockchain (24-bit blockheight, 24-bit transaction index within block, 16-bit output index), the spam-prevention might end up requiring more data than the spam it stops, so ---
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Though if Matt has some ideas here I would be greatly interested --- we do have to change the encodings of short-channel-ids at some point, if only to support channel factories....)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; they do it doesn't really matter. Allowing things like non-lightning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;channels&quot; (eg just a contractual agreement to settle up later between

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This information is broadcasted in the `channel_announcement` message in

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What can be the potential problem if a channel is opened
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whereby the channel capacity is not revealed publicly but just a range
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proof of the attribute (capacity &gt;0 and capacity &lt; value) is provided ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Will it pose a problem during routing of transaction ? What are the pros
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and cons ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that revealing channel capacity make the channels susceptible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; channel exhaustion attack or a particular node might be targeted for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node isolation attack ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yours sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subhra Mazumdar.
