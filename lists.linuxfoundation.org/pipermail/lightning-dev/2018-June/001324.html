<PRE>Hi Ren&#233;,

Speaking at a high level, the main differ between modifying autopilot
strategies (channel bootstrapping, and maintenance) vs something like
splicing, is that the former is purely policy while the latter is actually a
protocol modifications. With respect to difficulty, the first option (in lnd
at least) requires a dev to work solely on a high level (implementing a
series of &quot;pure&quot; interfaces), on the other hand something like splicing
requires a bit more low-level knowledge of Bitcoin, the protocol, and also
specific details of an implementation (funding channels, signing, sync,
etc).

Splicing is likely something to be included (along with many other things on
our various wish lists) within BOLT 1.1, which will start to be &quot;officially&quot;
drafted late fall of this year. However of course it's possible for
implementations to start to draft up working versions, reserving a temporary
feature bit.

&gt;<i> They people from lightning labs told me that they are currently started
</I>&gt;<i> working on splicing
</I>
Yep, I have a branch locally that has started a full async version of
splicing. Mostly started to see if any implementation level details would be
a surprise, compared to how we think it all should work in our heads.

&gt;<i> but even though it seems technically straight forward t
</I>
Well the full async implementation may be a bit involved, depending on the
architecture of the implementation (see the second point below).

In the abstract, I'd say a splicing proposal should include the following:

  * a generic message for both splice in/out
    * this allows both sides to schedule/queue up possible changes,
      opportunistically piggy-backing then on top of the other sides
      initiation
    * most of the channel params can also be re-negotiated as this point,
      another upside is this effectively allows garbage collecting old
      revocation state
  * fully async splice in/out
     * async is ideal as we don't need to block channel operation for
       confirmations, this greatly improves the UX of the process
     * async splice in should use a technique similar to what Conner has
       suggested in the past [0], otherwise it would need to block :(
  * a sort of pre-announcement gossip messages
     * purpose of this is to signal to other nodes &quot;hey this channel is
       about to change outpoints, but you can keep routing through it&quot;
     * otherwise, if this doesn't exist, then nodes would interpret the
       action as a close then open of a channel, rather than a re-allocation

Jumping down to a lower level detail, the inclusion of a sort of &quot;scheduler&quot;
for splicing can also allow implementations to greatly batch all their
operations. One example is using a splicing session initiated by the remote
party to open channels, send regular on-chain payments, CPFP pending
sweeps/commitments, etc.

&gt;<i> Hey everyone,

</I>&gt;<i> The background for my question: Last weekend I have been attending the 2nd
