<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,


&gt;<i> &gt; That is definitely a concern. It is up to senders how to interpret the
</I>&gt;<i> received timestamps. They can decide to tolerate slight variations. Or they
</I>&gt;<i> could just look at the difference between the in and out timestamp,
</I>&gt;<i> abandoning the synchronization requirement altogether (a node could also
</I>&gt;<i> just report that difference instead of two timestamps). The held duration
</I>&gt;<i> is enough to identify a pair of nodes from which one of the nodes is
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for the delay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example (held durations between parenthesis):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A (15 secs) -&gt; B (14 secs) -&gt; C (3 secs) -&gt; D (2 secs)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this case either B or C is delaying the payment. We'd penalize the
</I>&gt;<i> channel between B and C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems better.
</I>&gt;<i> If B is at fault, it could lie and reduce its reported delta time, but
</I>&gt;<i> that simply means it will be punished with A.
</I>&gt;<i> If C is at fault, it could lie and increase its reported delta time, but
</I>&gt;<i> that simply means it will be punished with D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I presume that the delta time is the time difference from when it sends
</I>&gt;<i> `update_add_htlc` and when it receives `update_fulfill_htlc`, or when it
</I>&gt;<i> gets an irrevocably committed `update_fail_htlc` + `revoke_and_ack`.
</I>&gt;<i> Is that accurate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes that is accurate, although using the time difference between receiving
the `update_add_htlc` and sending back the `update_fail_htlc` would work
too. It would then include the node's processing time.


&gt;<i> Unit should probably be milliseconds
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, we probably want sub-second resolution for this.

An alternative that comes to mind is to use active probing and tracking
&gt;<i> persistent data per node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For each node we record two pieces of information:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Total imposed delay.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Number of attempts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose a probe or payment takes N milliseconds on a route with M nodes to
</I>&gt;<i> fulfill or irrevocably fail at the payer.
</I>&gt;<i> For each node on the route, we increase Total imposed delay by N / M
</I>&gt;<i> rounded up, and increment Number of attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> For error reports we can shorten the route if we get an error response
</I>&gt;<i> that points to a specific failing node, or penalize the entire route in
</I>&gt;<i> case of a completely undecodable error response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When finding a route for a &quot;real&quot; payment, we adjust the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> traversing a node by the ratio Total imposed delay / Number of attempts (we
</I>&gt;<i> can avoid undefined math by starting both fields at 1).
</I>&gt;<i> For probes we can probably ignore this factor in order to give nodes that
</I>&gt;<i> happened to be borked by a different slow node on the trial route another
</I>&gt;<i> chance to exonerate their apparent slowness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This does not need changes in the current spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think we could indeed do more with the information that we currently have
and gather some more by probing. But in the end we would still be sampling
a noisy signal. More scenarios to take into account, less accurate results
and probably more non-ideal payment attempts. Failed, slow or stuck
payments degrade the user experience of lightning, while &quot;fat errors&quot;
arguably don't impact the user in a noticeable way.
