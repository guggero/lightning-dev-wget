<PRE>Hi Joost,

I agree that this would be desirable and would unlock better
decision-making about node and channel pruning.

A fixed length message in which hops shift some previous (unused) data out
&gt;<i> from the message to create space to add their own data does not seem to
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that shifting out data doesn't work. An alternative solution would
be to use a very big fixed-size message starting with some padding followed
by a variable-length message. Every node would add its mac to the internal
variable-length message and decrease the size of the initial padding.
However this becomes complex to handle when a malicious node reduces the
padding so that previous nodes don't have enough space to include their own
macs and timestamps.
That leads me to think that a fixed-size message won't resist arbitrary
malicious behavior (and might not offer much compared to a variable-length
message).

Another direction might be to use a variable length message, but have the
&gt;<i> error source add a seemingly random length padding. The actual length could
</I>&gt;<i> be deterministically derived from the shared secret, so that the erring
</I>&gt;<i> node cannot just not add padding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What about having each node add some padding along the way? The erring
node's padding should be bigger than intermediate nodes' padding (ideally
using a deterministic construction as you suggest) so details need to be
fleshed out, but it could mitigate even more the possibility of
intermediate nodes figuring out their approximate position.
That also mitigates the risk that a network observer correlates error
messages between hops (because in the variable-length message that you
propose, a network observer can easily track an error message across the
whole payment path).

I'm not a big fan of probing. If we can find a better solution than probing
I think it would always be desirable.

Cheers,
Bastien

Le mer. 12 juin 2019 &#224; 15:02, Joost Jager &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">joost.jager at gmail.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hello list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Lightning, the reliability of payments is dependent on the reliability
</I>&gt;<i> of the chosen route. Information about previous payment attempts helps to
</I>&gt;<i> select better routes and improve the payment experience. Therefore
</I>&gt;<i> implementations usually track the past performance of nodes and channels.
</I>&gt;<i> This can be as simple as a black list that contains previously failed
</I>&gt;<i> channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order for this mechanism to be most effective, it is important to know
</I>&gt;<i> which node is to blame for a non-ideal payment attempt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Non-ideal payment attempts are not only failed payment attempts (either
</I>&gt;<i> instantly failed or after a delay), but also successful payments for which
</I>&gt;<i> it took a long time to receive the `htlc_fulfill` message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For non-ideal payment attempts, we are currently not always able to
</I>&gt;<i> determine the node that should be penalized. In particular:
</I>&gt;<i> * If an attempt takes long to complete (settle or fail), we have no
</I>&gt;<i> information that points us to the source of the delay.
</I>&gt;<i> * Nodes can return a corrupt failure message. When this message arrives at
</I>&gt;<i> the sender after a number of encryption rounds, the sender is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> able to pinpoint the node that failed the payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A potential solution is to change the failure message such that every hop
</I>&gt;<i> along the backward path adds an hmac to the message (currently only the
</I>&gt;<i> error source authenticates the message). This allows the source of a
</I>&gt;<i> corruption to be narrowed down to a pair of nodes, which is enough to
</I>&gt;<i> properly apply a penalty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to that, all hops could add two timestamps to the failure
</I>&gt;<i> message: the htlc add time and the htlc fail time. Using this information,
</I>&gt;<i> the sender of the payment can identify the source of the delay down to,
</I>&gt;<i> again, a pair of nodes. Those timestamps could be added to the settle
</I>&gt;<i> message as well, to also allow diagnostics on slow settled payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The challenge here is to design the failure message format in such a way
</I>&gt;<i> that hops cannot learn their position in the path. Just appending
</I>&gt;<i> timestamps and hmacs to a variable length message would reveal the distance
</I>&gt;<i> between a node and the error source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A fixed length message in which hops shift some previous (unused) data out
</I>&gt;<i> from the message to create space to add their own data does not seem to
</I>&gt;<i> work. What happens is that the earlier nodes calculate their hmac over data
</I>&gt;<i> that is shifted out and cannot be recovered anymore by the sender. The
</I>&gt;<i> sender has no way to verify the hmac in that case. Regenerating the shifted
</I>&gt;<i> out data (similar to deterministic padding on the forward path) isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> solution either, because a node may modify that (unused) data before
</I>&gt;<i> passing the message on. This would invalidate all hmacs, denying the sender
</I>&gt;<i> from locating the responsible node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One space-inefficient solution is to have every hop add hmacs for every
</I>&gt;<i> possible (real) message length, but this would require n^2 hmacs in total
</I>&gt;<i> (20*20*32 bytes). Half of these could be discarded along the way, but it
</I>&gt;<i> would still leave 10*20*32=6.4kb of hmacs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another direction might be to use a variable length message, but have the
</I>&gt;<i> error source add a seemingly random length padding. The actual length could
</I>&gt;<i> be deterministically derived from the shared secret, so that the erring
</I>&gt;<i> node cannot just not add padding. This obfuscates the distance to the error
</I>&gt;<i> source somewhat, but still reveals a bit of information. If one knows that
</I>&gt;<i> the padding length is somewhere between 0 and 20 blocks worth of bytes, a
</I>&gt;<i> message length of say 25 blocks would reveal that the err source is at
</I>&gt;<i> least 5 hops away. It could be a fair trade-off though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An alternative to all of this is to try to locate bad nodes by probing
</I>&gt;<i> with different route lengths and coming from different angles. This will
</I>&gt;<i> however require more attempts and more complex processing of the outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a level of indirectness because not all information is
</I>&gt;<i> gathered in a single roundtrip. And in addition to that, a malicious node
</I>&gt;<i> may somehow act differently if it manages to recognize the probes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be interested to hear your opinions about the importance of being able
</I>&gt;<i> to locate bad nodes irrefutably, as well as ideas around the failure
</I>&gt;<i> message format.
