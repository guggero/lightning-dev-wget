<PRE>Good morning group,

My friend came to similar (almost the same) conclusions over a year ago,
and I were working on implementation of this. I had first working prototype
based on clightning (but not trustless), but at that time there were so
many troubles with c-lightning, co I decided to make this solution based on
LND. Unfortunately, I have other issues with LND also. There are some API
method missing in LND and c-lightning also. This is the reason, I'm
seriously tired doing this. I think, that was mistake to start working on
that without more talks with you and community.

Tomorrow, we scheduled to talk if it make sense to continue. A lot of
options are possible. If you, agree, it would be valuable to make such
thing, I can work on it as full time job (my friend is wiling to pay for
that). I prefer to write it in Java rather and also need your support
especially in terms of lack of some API methods.

Please let me know, if we can build cross-implementation group to work on
such thing and if you are willing to help.

Best Regards,
Cezary Dziemian

&gt;<i> Good morning lisa,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can simply close the channel. So if I'm charging for liquidity, I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; want to charge for the amount (in mSAT/BTC) times time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So perhaps you could make a market here by establishing a channel saying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   &quot;I'll pay 32 msat per 500 satoshi per hour for the first 3 days&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you open the channel with 500,000 satoshi donated by the other guy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're then obliged to transfer 32 satoshi every hour to the other guy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for three days (so a total of 14c or so).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the channel fails beforehand, they don't get paid; if you stop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paying you can still theoretically do a mutual close.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this can also be gamed by a second, cooperating node that
</I>&gt;<i> sends payments through the channel to meet the rate and capture the fees
</I>&gt;<i> for the first. You can make this less likely by charging higher
</I>&gt;<i> transmission fees that make such an attack infeasible, and it's less
</I>&gt;<i> 'damaging' than an immediate close in that there's still open capacity
</I>&gt;<i> available for some time, at least until the 'bogus' payments have drained
</I>&gt;<i> the capacity that you solicited in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe not?
</I>&gt;<i> I do not see any terms in the contract regarding payments through the
</I>&gt;<i> channel other than the &quot;liveness&quot; payment.
</I>&gt;<i> So regardless of activity (or lack of activity) in the channel, the above
</I>&gt;<i> payments should be made.
</I>&gt;<i> If the taker misses a payment, the maker closes the channel outright,
</I>&gt;<i> freeing itself from the obligation.
</I>&gt;<i> If the maker refuses to route, it loses out on potential routing fees.
</I>&gt;<i> Any activity through it do not seem to matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This mechanism may actually be superior to the CLTV-encumberance I and
</I>&gt;<i> Rene proposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
