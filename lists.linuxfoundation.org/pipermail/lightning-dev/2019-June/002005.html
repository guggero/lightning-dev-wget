<PRE>Hey Pierre, 

 

That&#8217;s what I am having a hard time understanding. Although it is timelocked in the second stage HTLC-timeout, I can still spend the original commitment transaction although after some time. This is what my thought process is:

 

*	Offer the Htlc output and sign the commitment transactions
*	Broadcast the commitment transaction containing the offered HTLC outputs to the main chain. The outputs of commitment tx are: (1) to remote; (2) to local with to_self_delay and (3) to P2WSH (the script I pasted earlier)
*	Commitment transaction gets mined
*	Spend the third output using 0 &lt;remotehtlcsig&gt; &lt;localhtlcsig&gt; 0 in the witness stack which will send the outputs to &lt;local_delayed_pubkey&gt; using to_self_delay

Now I think when you say the HTLC time out transaction is timelocked, you are referring the to the to_self_delay when spending the htlc-timeout. But although there is that timeout, the commitment transaction is already broadcasted, and the P2WSH output is already sent to my public key (although with a delay I can still spend that without my counterparty&#8217;s assent). Now, my counterparty on the other hand  when he gets the pre-image, does not have the P2WSH output to claim his bitcoins with the pre-image because it has been already locked with my &lt;local_delayed_pubkey&gt; which I can spend when the to_senf_delay` is over

Hello Ugam,

 

The HTLC-Timeout transaction &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md#htlc-timeout-and-htlc-success-transactions">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/03-transactions.md#htlc-timeout-and-htlc-success-transactions</A>&gt;  is timelocked (with locktime=cltv_expiry).

 

Cheers,

 

Pierre
