<PRE>Good morning Stepan,



&gt;<i> Hi ZmnSCPxj,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The online node in your proposal is unable to extract `K`, a the next-node-ID is never transmitted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then currently for the vending machines we can use a pre-shared common secret set up at installation time (may be unique for every machine) and use it for preimage generation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> preimage = hmac(common_secret, amount | nonce)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can pass this nonce as a channel id. This is exactly what we did for the hackathon project. Such invoice has to be paid with exact amount, there is no way to include a tip - otherwise preimage generation will fail.
</I>
I observe that any tip worth its name would be a positive delta over the invoice face value.

Thus, if you want to accept tips up to (say) 25% above the invoice face value, you can just iterate from `amount_to_forward` down to `0.8 * amount_to_forward` and see if it yields a preimage that matches the payment hash.

This may require some grinding; but remember that you have several blocks in which you can compute this.

This is particularly relevant for older versions of C-lightning which implemented value randomization (i.e. adding a small random tip in an attempt to fool analysts from determining the actual value being paid --- BOLT spec specifically allows this behavior).
(This was inadvertently removed/not implemented in newer versions after the pay algorithm was moved to a plugin; since nobody but me was interested in value randomization anyway, I decided not to reimplement it until somebody else asks for it)


&gt;<i> Online node can try to generate the preimage for every htlc offer with all known common secrets and the channel ID, and if it fails - try to route the payment as usual.
</I>
It is probably faster on most implementations to look up the channel ID in some hash table first, i.e. try to route first before generating preimages.
Of course, 64-bit `short_channel_id` as nonce is likely to hit a &quot;real&quot; channel ID, but you can avoid this by restricting the range to far-future blockheights and/or before the `when_lightning_became_cool` blockheight.


Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
