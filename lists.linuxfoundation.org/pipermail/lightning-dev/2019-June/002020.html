<PRE>Good morning Bastien and Joost,

Before proceeding with discussing HMACs and preventing nodes from putting words in the mouths of other nodes, perhaps we should consider, how we can ensure that nodes can be forced to be accurate about what happened.

For instance, a proposal is for nodes to put timestamps for certain events.
Does this imply that all nodes along the route **MUST** have their clocks strongly synchronized to some global clock?
If a node along the route happens to be 15 seconds early or 15 seconds late, can it be erroneously &quot;dinged&quot; for this when a later hop delays a successful payment for 20 seconds?

If it requires that hop nodes have strong synchrony with some global clock service, why would I want to run a hop node then?
What happens if some global clock service is attacked in order to convince nodes to route to particular nodes (using a competing global clock service) on the Lightning network?

&gt;<i> I'm not a big fan of probing. If we can find a better solution than probing I think it would always be desirable.
</I>
It has the significant advantage of giving you accurate real-world data, for only the opportunity cost of locking some tiny fraction of your funds.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another direction might be to use a variable length message, but have the error source add a seemingly random length padding. The actual length could be deterministically derived from the shared secret, so that the erring node cannot just not add padding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about having each node add some padding along the way? The erring node's padding should be bigger than intermediate nodes' padding (ideally using a deterministic construction as you suggest) so details need to be fleshed out, but it could mitigate even more the possibility of intermediate nodes figuring out their approximate position.
</I>&gt;<i> That also mitigates the risk that a network observer correlates error messages between hops (because in the variable-length message that you propose, a network observer can easily track an error message across the whole payment path).

</I>&gt;<i> Le&#160;mer. 12 juin 2019 &#224;&#160;15:02, Joost Jager &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">joost.jager at gmail.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit&#160;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello list,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In Lightning, the reliability of payments is dependent on the reliability of the chosen route. Information about previous payment attempts helps to select better routes and improve the payment experience. Therefore implementations usually track the past performance of nodes and channels. This can be as simple as a black list that contains previously failed channels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order for this mechanism to be most effective, it is important to know which node is to blame for a non-ideal payment attempt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Non-ideal payment attempts are not only failed payment attempts (either instantly failed or after a delay), but also successful payments for which it took a long time to receive the `htlc_fulfill` message.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For non-ideal payment attempts, we are currently not always able to determine the node that should be penalized. In particular:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * If an attempt takes long to complete (settle or fail), we have no information that points us to the source of the delay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Nodes can return a corrupt failure message. When this message arrives at the sender after a number of encryption rounds, the sender is no longer able to pinpoint the node that failed the payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A potential solution is to change the failure message such that every hop along the backward path adds an hmac to the message (currently only the error source authenticates the message). This allows the source of a corruption to be narrowed down to a pair of nodes, which is enough to properly apply a penalty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition to that, all hops could add two timestamps to the failure message: the htlc add time and the htlc fail time. Using this information, the sender of the payment can identify the source of the delay down to, again, a pair of nodes. Those timestamps could be added to the settle message as well, to also allow diagnostics on slow settled payments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The challenge here is to design the failure message format in such a way that hops cannot learn their position in the path. Just appending timestamps and hmacs to a variable length message would reveal the distance between a node and the error source.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A fixed length message in which hops shift some previous (unused) data out from the message to create space to add their own data does not seem to work. What happens is that the earlier nodes calculate their hmac over data that is shifted out and cannot be recovered anymore by the sender. The sender has no way to verify the hmac in that case. Regenerating the shifted out data (similar to deterministic padding on the forward path) isn't a solution either, because a node may modify that (unused) data before passing the message on. This would invalidate all hmacs, denying the sender from locating the responsible node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One space-inefficient solution is to have every hop add hmacs for every possible (real) message length, but this would require n^2 hmacs in total (20*20*32 bytes). Half of these could be discarded along the way, but it would still leave 10*20*32=6.4kb of hmacs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another direction might be to use a variable length message, but have the error source add a seemingly random length padding. The actual length could be deterministically derived from the shared secret, so that the erring node cannot just not add padding. This obfuscates the distance to the error source somewhat, but still reveals a bit of information. If one knows that the padding length is somewhere between 0 and 20 blocks worth of bytes, a message length of say 25 blocks would reveal that the err source is at least 5 hops away. It could be a fair trade-off though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An alternative to all of this is to try to locate bad nodes by probing with different route lengths and coming from different angles. This will however require more attempts and more complex processing of the outcomes. There is also a level of indirectness because not all information is gathered in a single roundtrip. And in addition to that, a malicious node may somehow act differently if it manages to recognize the probes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be interested to hear your opinions about the importance of being able to locate bad nodes irrefutably, as well as ideas around the failure message format.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
