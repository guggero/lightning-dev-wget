<PRE>Hello list,

In Lightning, the reliability of payments is dependent on the reliability
of the chosen route. Information about previous payment attempts helps to
select better routes and improve the payment experience. Therefore
implementations usually track the past performance of nodes and channels.
This can be as simple as a black list that contains previously failed
channels.

In order for this mechanism to be most effective, it is important to know
which node is to blame for a non-ideal payment attempt.

Non-ideal payment attempts are not only failed payment attempts (either
instantly failed or after a delay), but also successful payments for which
it took a long time to receive the `htlc_fulfill` message.

For non-ideal payment attempts, we are currently not always able to
determine the node that should be penalized. In particular:
* If an attempt takes long to complete (settle or fail), we have no
information that points us to the source of the delay.
* Nodes can return a corrupt failure message. When this message arrives at
the sender after a number of encryption rounds, the sender is no longer
able to pinpoint the node that failed the payment.

A potential solution is to change the failure message such that every hop
along the backward path adds an hmac to the message (currently only the
error source authenticates the message). This allows the source of a
corruption to be narrowed down to a pair of nodes, which is enough to
properly apply a penalty.

In addition to that, all hops could add two timestamps to the failure
message: the htlc add time and the htlc fail time. Using this information,
the sender of the payment can identify the source of the delay down to,
again, a pair of nodes. Those timestamps could be added to the settle
message as well, to also allow diagnostics on slow settled payments.

The challenge here is to design the failure message format in such a way
that hops cannot learn their position in the path. Just appending
timestamps and hmacs to a variable length message would reveal the distance
between a node and the error source.

A fixed length message in which hops shift some previous (unused) data out
from the message to create space to add their own data does not seem to
work. What happens is that the earlier nodes calculate their hmac over data
that is shifted out and cannot be recovered anymore by the sender. The
sender has no way to verify the hmac in that case. Regenerating the shifted
out data (similar to deterministic padding on the forward path) isn't a
solution either, because a node may modify that (unused) data before
passing the message on. This would invalidate all hmacs, denying the sender
from locating the responsible node.

One space-inefficient solution is to have every hop add hmacs for every
possible (real) message length, but this would require n^2 hmacs in total
(20*20*32 bytes). Half of these could be discarded along the way, but it
would still leave 10*20*32=6.4kb of hmacs.

Another direction might be to use a variable length message, but have the
error source add a seemingly random length padding. The actual length could
be deterministically derived from the shared secret, so that the erring
node cannot just not add padding. This obfuscates the distance to the error
source somewhat, but still reveals a bit of information. If one knows that
the padding length is somewhere between 0 and 20 blocks worth of bytes, a
message length of say 25 blocks would reveal that the err source is at
least 5 hops away. It could be a fair trade-off though.

An alternative to all of this is to try to locate bad nodes by probing with
different route lengths and coming from different angles. This will however
require more attempts and more complex processing of the outcomes. There is
also a level of indirectness because not all information is gathered in a
single roundtrip. And in addition to that, a malicious node may somehow act
differently if it manages to recognize the probes.

I'd be interested to hear your opinions about the importance of being able
to locate bad nodes irrefutably, as well as ideas around the failure
message format.
