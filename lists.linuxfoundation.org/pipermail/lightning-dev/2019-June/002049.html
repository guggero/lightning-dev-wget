<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj and Bastien,

When I was putting together this proposal, I thought it would be difficult
for me to consider all the security and privacy issues. I am very glad that
you raised the possible issues.

&gt;<i> So my opinion, it is best to retain this property of &quot;D does not know
</I>payer A&quot;.

I agree with your opinion too. I thought there was no problem if the ACK
and the PoP were responses of the HTLCs and the key respectively. But,

&gt;<i> The added communication round may allow intermediate node to guess the
</I>payer.

&gt;<i> With addition of new ACK-key turnaround, intermediate node can measure
</I>time from send of ACK to receive of key, and guess its distance to payer.

Right.

&gt;<i> A can select another route (e.g. D -&gt; E -&gt; F -&gt; A) and can create the ACK
</I>&gt;<i> onion packet during the setup phase.
</I>&gt;<i> A can then embed this ACK packet inside the last hop payload of the
</I>&gt;<i> *add_htlc* onion packet.
</I>&gt;<i> When D receives it, it simply sends that onion to the indicated recipient
</I>&gt;<i> (E) which will unwrap and forward.
</I>&gt;<i> This way D doesn't learn anything about A, and intermediate nodes aren't
</I>&gt;<i> included in the ACK route so
</I>&gt;<i> they don't learn anything either.
</I>
I think this is likely to be an improvement. This could also be generalized
as a case where a packet we send goes back to us via a given node. I need
to understand more precisely the limitations of the onion packet including
new specs under development. In the process, I will also consider
combination of this proposal with AMP and new routing algorithms
(Trampoline, Rendezvous).

Regards,
Hiroki
