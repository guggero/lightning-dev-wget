Of course, uninformed people _do_ read all kinds of technical materials. And
more importantly, those technical materials get quoted by journalists,
scammers, etc.

Please don't trim quoted text to the point where all context is lost. Lots of
people read this mailing list and doing that isn't helpful to them.

&gt;<i> &gt; Remember that OTS simply proves data in the past. Nothing more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OTS doesn't have a chain of transactions
</I>&gt;<i> Gotcha -- I've not been able to find an actual spec of Open Time Stamps
</I>
The technical spec of OpenTimestamps is of course the normative validation
source code, currently python-opentimestamps, similar to how the technical spec
of Bitcoin is the consensus parts of the Bitcoin Core codebase. The explanatory
docs are linked on <A HREF="https://opentimestamps.org">https://opentimestamps.org</A> under the &quot;How It Works&quot; section.
It'd be good to take the linked post in that section and turn it into better
explanatory materials with graphics (esp interactive/animated graphics).

&gt;<i> anywhere, so I suppose I just assumed based on how I think it *should*
</I>&gt;<i> work. Having a chain of transactions would serve to linearize history of
</I>&gt;<i> OTS commitments which would let you prove, given reorgs, that knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i> commit A was before B a bit more robustly.
</I>
I'll reply to this as a separate email as this discussion - while useful - is
getting quite off topic for this thread.

&gt;<i> &gt;  I'd rather do one transaction with all pending commitments at a
</I>&gt;<i> particular time
</I>&gt;<i> rather than waste money on mining two transactions for a given set of
</I>&gt;<i> commitments
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like a personal preference v.s. a technical requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You aren't doing any extra transactions in the model i showed, what you're
</I>&gt;<i> doing is selecting the window for the next based on the prior conf.
</I>
...the model you showed is wrong, as there is no reason to have a linearized
transaction history. OpenTimestamps proofs don't even have the concept of
transactions: the proof format proves that data existed prior to a merkle root
of a particular Bitcoin block. Not a Bitcoin transaction.

&gt;<i> See the diagram below, you would have to (if OTS is correct) support this
</I>&gt;<i> sort of 'attempt/confirm' head that tracks attempted commitments and
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed ones and 'rewinds' after a confirm to make the next commit
</I>&gt;<i> contain the prior attempts that didn't make it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [.........................................................................]
</I>&gt;<i>  ------^ confirm head tx 0 at height 34
</I>&gt;<i>         ------------------------^ attempt head after tx 0
</I>&gt;<i>          -----------^ confirm head tx 1 at height 35
</I>&gt;<i>                       --------------------------^ attempt head after tx 1
</I>&gt;<i>                       ------------^ confirm head tx 2 at height 36
</I>&gt;<i>                                      -------------------------------^
</I>&gt;<i> attempt head after tx 2
</I>&gt;<i>                                       -------------------------------^
</I>&gt;<i> confirm head tx 3 at height 37
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> you can compare this to a &quot;spherical cow&quot; model where RBF is always perfect
</I>&gt;<i> and guaranteed inclusion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [.........................................................................]
</I>&gt;<i>  ------^ confirm head tx 0 at height 34
</I>&gt;<i>        -------------------------^ confirm head tx 1 at height 35
</I>&gt;<i>                                        -----------^ confirm head at tx 1
</I>&gt;<i> height 36
</I>&gt;<i>                                                        -----------------^
</I>&gt;<i> confirm head tx 3 at height 37
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same number of transactions gets used over the time period.
</I>
None of the above has anything to do with how OpenTimestamps works.

Anyway, getting back to the topic at hand, I remain of the opinion that in the
unlikely event that fee accounts is ever implemented, it should be opt-in.
