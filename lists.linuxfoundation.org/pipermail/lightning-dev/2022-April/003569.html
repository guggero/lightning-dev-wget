Hmm? I'm a bit confused, let me attempt to restate to make sure we're on the same page. What I 
*think* you said here is: &quot;If you have a node which is rejecting a large percentage *channel*'s 
updates (on a per-channel, not per-update basis), and it tries to sync, you'll end up having to keep 
some huge set of 'I dont want any more updates for that channel' on a per-peer basis&quot;? Or maybe you 
might have said &quot;When you rate-limit, you have to tell your peer that you rate-limited a channel 
update and that it shouldn't add that update to its next sketch&quot;?

Either way, I don't think its all that interesting an issue. The first case is definitely an issue, 
but is an issue in both a new-data-only sketch and all-data sketch world, and is not completely 
solved with identical rate-limits in any case. It can be largely addressed by sane software defaults 
and roughly-similar rate-limits, though, and because its a per-channel, not per-update issue I'm 
much less concerned.

The second potential thing I think you might have meant here I don't see as an issue at all? You can 
simply...let the sketch include one channel update that you ignored? See above discussion of similar 
rate-limits.

&gt;<i> So you end up doing that LND and core-lightning do, which is &quot;pick 3
</I>&gt;<i> peers to gossip with&quot; and tell everyone else to shut up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet the point of minisketch is robustness; you can (at cost of 1 message
</I>&gt;<i> per minute) keep in sync with an arbitrary number of peers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, we might as well define a preferred ratelimit, so nodes know that
</I>&gt;<i> spamming past a certain point is not going to propagate.  At the moment,
</I>&gt;<i> LND has no effective ratelimit at all, so it's a race to the bottom.
</I>
I agree there should be *some* rough consensus, but rate-limits are a locally-enforced thing, not a 
global one. There will always be races and updates you reject that your peers dont, no matter the 
rate-limit, and while I agree we should have guidelines, we can't &quot;just make them the same&quot; - it 
both doesn't solve the problem and means we can't change them in the future.

Ultimately, a updates-based sync is more robust in such a case - if there's some race and your peer 
accepts something you don't it may mean one more entry in the sketch one time, but it won't hang 
around forever.

&gt;<i> We need that limit eventually, this just makes it more of a priority.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure in a world where you do &quot;update-based-sketch&quot; gossip sync you're any worse off than today even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with different rate-limit policies, though I obviously agree there are substantial issues with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> massively inconsistent rate-limit policies we see today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can't really do it, since rate-limited junk overwhelms the sketch
</I>&gt;<i> really fast :(
</I>
How is this any better in a non-update-based-sketch? The only way to address it is to have a bigger 
sketch, which you can do no matter the thing you're building the sketch over.

Maybe lets schedule a call to get on the same page, throwing text at each other will likely not move 
very quickly.
