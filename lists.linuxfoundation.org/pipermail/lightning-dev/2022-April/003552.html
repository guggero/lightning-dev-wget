<PRE>Good morning Alex,

I&#8217;ve been investigating set reconciliation as a means to reduce bandwidth

and redundancy of gossip message propagation.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Cool project, glad to see someone working on it! The main difficulty here
will
indeed be to ensure that the number of differences between sets is bounded.
We will need to maintain a mechanism to sync the whole graph from scratch
for new nodes, so the minisketch diff must be efficient enough otherwise
nodes
will just fall back to a full sync way too often (which would waste a lot of
bandwidth).

Picking several offending channel ids, and digging further, the majority of
&gt;<i> these
</I>
appear to be flapping due to Tor or otherwise intermittent connections.
&gt;<i>
</I>
One thing that may help here from an implementation's point of view is to
avoid
sending a disabled channel update every time a channel goes offline. What
eclair does to avoid spamming is to only send a disabled channel update when
someone actually tries to use that channel. Of course, if people choose this
offline node in their route, you don't have a choice and will need to send a
disabled channel update, but we've observed that many channels come back
online before we actually need to use them, so we're saving two channel
updates
(one to disable the channel and one to re-enable it). I think all
implementations
should do this. Is that the case today?

We could go even further, and when we receive an htlc that should be relayed
to an offline node, wait a bit to give them an opportunity to come online
instead
of failing the htlc and sending a disabled channel update. Eclair currently
doesn't
do that, but it would be very easy to add.

- A common listing of current default rate limits across lightning network
&gt;<i> implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Eclair doesn't do any rate-limiting. We wanted to &quot;feel the pain&quot; before
adding
anything, and to be honest we haven't really felt it yet.

which will use a common, simple heuristic to accept or reject a gossip
&gt;<i> message.
</I>
(Think one channel update per block, or perhaps one per block_height &lt;&lt; 5.)
&gt;<i>
</I>
I think it would be easy to come to agreement between implementations and
restrict channel updates to at most one every N blocks. We simply need to
add
the `block_height` in a tlv in `channel_update` and then we'll be able to
actually
rate-limit based on it. Given how much time it takes to upgrade most of the
network, it may be a good idea to add the `block_height` tlv now in the
spec,
and act on it later? Unless your work requires bigger changes in channel
update
in which case it will probably be a new message.

Note that it will never be completely accurate though, as different nodes
can
have different blockchain tips. My nodes may be one or two blocks late
compared
to the node that emits the channel update. We need to allow a bit of leeway
there.

Cheers,
Bastien

&gt;<i> Hello lightning developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve been investigating set reconciliation as a means to reduce bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> and redundancy of gossip message propagation. This builds on some earlier work
</I>&gt;<i> from Rusty using the minisketch library [1]. The idea is that each node
</I>&gt;<i> will build a sketch representing it&#8217;s own gossip set. Alice&#8217;s node will
</I>&gt;<i> encode and transmit this sketch to Bob&#8217;s node, where it will be merged with
</I>&gt;<i> his own sketch, and the differences produced. These differences should
</I>&gt;<i> ideally be exactly the latest missing gossip of both nodes. Due to size
</I>&gt;<i> constraints, the set differences will necessarily be encoded, but Bob&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> node will be able to identify which gossip Alice is missing, and may then
</I>&gt;<i> transmit exactly those messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This process is relatively straightforward, with the caveat that the sets
</I>&gt;<i> must otherwise match very closely (each sketch has a maximum capacity for
</I>&gt;<i> differences.) The difficulty here is that each node and lightning
</I>&gt;<i> implementation may have its own rules for gossip acceptance and
</I>&gt;<i> propagation. Depending on their gossip partners, not all gossip may
</I>&gt;<i> propagate to the entire network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Core-lightning implements rate limiting for incoming channel updates and
</I>&gt;<i> node announcements. The default rate limit is 1 per day, with a burst of
</I>&gt;<i> 4. I analyzed my node&#8217;s gossip over a 14 day period, and found that, of
</I>&gt;<i> all publicly broadcasting half-channels, 18% of them fell afoul of our
</I>&gt;<i> spam-limiting rules at least once. [2]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Picking several offending channel ids, and digging further, the majority
</I>&gt;<i> of these appear to be flapping due to Tor or otherwise intermittent
</I>&gt;<i> connections. Well connected nodes may be more susceptible to this due to more
</I>&gt;<i> frequent routing attempts, and failures resulting in a returned channel
</I>&gt;<i> update (which otherwise might not have been broadcast.) A slight
</I>&gt;<i> relaxation of the rate limit resolves the majority of these cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A smaller subset of channels broadcast frequent channel updates with minor
</I>&gt;<i> adjustments to htlc_maximum_msat and fee_proportional_millionths
</I>&gt;<i> parameters. These nodes appear to be power users, with many channels and
</I>&gt;<i> large balances. I assume this is automated channel management at work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Core-Lightning has updated rate-limiting in the upcoming release to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve a higher acceptance of incoming gossip, however, it seems that a
</I>&gt;<i> broader discussion of rate limits may now be worthwhile. A few immediate
</I>&gt;<i> ideas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A common listing of current default rate limits across lightning
</I>&gt;<i> network implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Internal checks of RPC input to limit or warn of network propagation
</I>&gt;<i> issues if certain rates are exceeded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A commonly adopted rate-limit standard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My aim is a set reconciliation gossip type, which will use a common,
</I>&gt;<i> simple heuristic to accept or reject a gossip message. (Think one channel
</I>&gt;<i> update per block, or perhaps one per block_height &lt;&lt; 5.) See my github
</I>&gt;<i> for my current draft. [3] This solution allows tighter consensus, yet suffers
</I>&gt;<i> from the same problem as original anti-spam measures &#8211; it remains
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat arbitrary. I would like to start a conversation regarding gossip
</I>&gt;<i> propagation, channel_update and node_announcement usage, and perhaps even
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth goals for syncing gossip in the future (how about a million
</I>&gt;<i> channels?) This would aid in the development of gossip set
</I>&gt;<i> reconciliation, but could also benefit current node connection and
</I>&gt;<i> routing reliability more generally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
