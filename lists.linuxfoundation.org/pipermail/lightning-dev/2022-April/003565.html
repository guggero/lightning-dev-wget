&gt;&gt;<i> Allowing only 1 a day, ended up with 18% of channels hitting the spam
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limit.  We cannot fit that many channel differences inside a set!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps Alex should post his more detailed results, but it's pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clear that we can't stay in sync with this many differences :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, the fact that most nodes don't do any limiting at all and y'all have a *very* aggressive (by 
</I>&gt;<i> comparison) limit is going to be an issue in any context.
</I>
I'm unable to find the post years ago where I proposed this limit
and nobody had major objections.  I just volunteered to go first :)

&gt;<i> We could set some guidelines and improve 
</I>&gt;<i> things, but luckily regular-update-sync bypasses some of these issues anyway - if we sync once per 
</I>&gt;<i> block and your limit is once per block, getting 1000 updates per block for some channel doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> result in multiple failures in the sync. Sure, multiple peers sending different updates for that 
</I>&gt;<i> channel can still cause some failures, but its still much better.
</I>
Nodes will want to aggressively spam as much as they can, so I think we
need a widely-agreed limit.  I don't really care what it is, but
somewhere between per 1 and 1000 blocks makes sense?

Normally I'd suggest a burst, but that's bad for consensus: better to
say &quot;just create your update N-6 blocks behind so you can always create a
new one 6 blocks behind&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> gossip queries  is broken in at least five ways.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Naah, it's perfect if you simply want to ask &quot;give me updates since XXX&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get you close enough on reconnect to start using set reconciliation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This might allow us to remove some of the other features?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but that's *just* the &quot;gossip_timestamp_filter&quot; message, there's several other messages and a 
</I>&gt;<i> whole query system that we can throw away if we just want that message :)
</I>
I agree.  Removing features would be nice :)

&gt;&gt;<i> But we might end up with a gossip2 if we want to enable taproot, and use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blockheight as timestamps, in which case we could probably just support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that one operation (and maybe a direct query op).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Like eclair, we don&#8217;t bother to rate limit and don&#8217;t see any issues with it, though we will skip relaying outbound updates if we&#8217;re saturating outbound connections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, we did as a trial, and in some cases it's become limiting.  In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular, people restarting their LND nodes once a day resulting in 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updates per day (which, in 0.11.0, we now allow).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean &quot;its become limiting&quot;? As in you hit some reasonably-low CPU/disk/bandwidth limit 
</I>&gt;<i> in doing this? We have a pretty aggressive bandwidth limit for this kinda stuff (well, indirect 
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth limit) and it very rarely hits in my experience (unless the peer is very overloaded and 
</I>&gt;<i> not responding to pings, which is a somewhat separate thing...)
</I>
By rejecting more than 1 per day, some LND nodes had 50% of their
channels left disabled :(

This same problem will occur if *anyone* does ratelimiting, unless
*everyone* does.  And with minisketch, there's a good reason to do so.

Cheers,
Rusty.
