Please, no. initial_routing_sync was removed from most implementations (it sucks) and gossip queries 
is broken in at least five ways. May we can recover it by adding yet more extensions but if we're 
gonna add a minisketch-based sync anyway, please lets also use it for initial sync after restart 
(unless you have no channels at all, in which case lets maybe revive initial_routing_sync...)
