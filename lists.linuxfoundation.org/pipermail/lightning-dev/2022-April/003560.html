Let's be clear: it's a problem.

Allowing only 1 a day, ended up with 18% of channels hitting the spam
limit.  We cannot fit that many channel differences inside a set!

Perhaps Alex should post his more detailed results, but it's pretty
clear that we can't stay in sync with this many differences :(

&gt;<i> gossip queries  is broken in at least five ways.
</I>
Naah, it's perfect if you simply want to ask &quot;give me updates since XXX&quot;
to get you close enough on reconnect to start using set reconciliation.
This might allow us to remove some of the other features?

But we might end up with a gossip2 if we want to enable taproot, and use
blockheight as timestamps, in which case we could probably just support
that one operation (and maybe a direct query op).

&gt;<i> Like eclair, we don&#8217;t bother to rate limit and don&#8217;t see any issues with it, though we will skip relaying outbound updates if we&#8217;re saturating outbound connections.
</I>
Yeah, we did as a trial, and in some cases it's become limiting.  In
particular, people restarting their LND nodes once a day resulting in 2
updates per day (which, in 0.11.0, we now allow).

Cheers,
Rusty.
