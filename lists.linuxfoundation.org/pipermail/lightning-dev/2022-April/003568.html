</I>
You can't do this, with minisketch.  You end up having to keep all the
ratelimited differences you're ignoring *per peer*, and then cancelling
them out of the minisketch on every receive or send.

So you end up doing that LND and core-lightning do, which is &quot;pick 3
peers to gossip with&quot; and tell everyone else to shut up.

Yet the point of minisketch is robustness; you can (at cost of 1 message
per minute) keep in sync with an arbitrary number of peers.

So, we might as well define a preferred ratelimit, so nodes know that
spamming past a certain point is not going to propagate.  At the moment,
LND has no effective ratelimit at all, so it's a race to the bottom.

We need that limit eventually, this just makes it more of a priority.

&gt;<i> I'm not really 
</I>&gt;<i> sure in a world where you do &quot;update-based-sketch&quot; gossip sync you're any worse off than today even 
</I>&gt;<i> with different rate-limit policies, though I obviously agree there are substantial issues with the 
</I>&gt;<i> massively inconsistent rate-limit policies we see today.
</I>
You can't really do it, since rate-limited junk overwhelms the sketch
really fast :(

Note, we *can* actually change the ratelimit in future, either by
running two sketches (feature bit!), or by changing the rate slowly
enough that they can handle the small differences.

Cheers,
Rusty.
