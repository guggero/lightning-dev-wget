It's pretty simple: bitcoin-dev is read by hundreds of people. This has nothing
to do with authority. It's about not wasting the time of those people.

&gt;<i> concretely, I am confused by how OTS can both support RBF for updating to

</I>&gt;<i> about the issue you see with how sponsors works.
</I>
OpenTimestamps is, as the name suggests, for cryptographic timestamping. As is
obvious to anyone with a good knowledge of cryptography, a cryptographic
timestamp proves that data existed prior to some point in time. That's it.

&gt;<i> further, I think that if there is something that sponsors does that could
</I>&gt;<i> make a hypothetical OTS-like service work better, in a way that would be
</I>&gt;<i> opaque (read: soft-fork like wrt compatibility) to clients, then we should
</I>&gt;<i> just change what OTS is rather than committing ourselves to a worse design
</I>&gt;<i> in service of some unstated design goals. In particular, it seems that
</I>&gt;<i> OTS's servers can be linearized and because old clients aren't looking for
</I>&gt;<i> linearization, then the new linearization won't be a breaking change for
</I>&gt;<i> old clients, just calendar servers. And new clients can benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> linearization.
</I>
The fact you keep bringing up linearization for a timestmaping service makes me
think something is missing in your understanding of cryptography. Tell me, how
exactly do you think linearization would help in an example use-case? More
specifically, what attack would be prevented?
