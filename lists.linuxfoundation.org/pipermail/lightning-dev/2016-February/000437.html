I think the options are:

 a) keep the channel open
 b) they close the channel unilaterally
 c) you close the channel unilaterally
 d) you both close the channel cooperatively

At any point, I believe the preferences are strictly: d &gt; b &gt; c

(b) is better than (c) because of the OP_CSV delay; and (d) is better
than (b) if you can use a lower transaction fee than you use for your
commitment transactions, or spend directly to a useful output address
(opening up a new channel eg).

If you find yourself trying to convince the other person to do (b)
to avoid doing (c) yourself, I think it's a dominating strategy to
simply do (d) -- you prefer that over (b) anyway, and they will prefer
it over (c).

With the current arrangement, I don't think your counterparty can
realistically make any threats: &quot;you'll close the channel? okay,
that's better than me closing it!&quot; and &quot;you'll close the channel
unilaterally? well, that's a lot worse for you as it is for me,
so whatever&quot;.

With an OP_CSV on both sides of HTLCs, you can make a somewhat
realistic threat: &quot;if you don't pay me $x to do a cooperative close,
I'll close unilaterally which will lock your funds up. sure you can
close unilaterally yourself, but your funds will still be locked up that
way too.&quot;

So changing seems like it would make things marginally worse, but no
better, to me.

Cheers,
aj
