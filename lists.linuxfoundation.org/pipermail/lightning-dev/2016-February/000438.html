</I>&gt;<i> Referring to Appendix A of the paper, under &quot;HTLC Receiver Redeemscript&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (since Alice offers Eve the HTLC, Eve is B):
</I>&gt;<i> [..]
</I>
So, summarized, the &quot;HTLC Receiver Redeemscript&quot; is actually something
like:

R-VALUE &amp; OP_CSV &amp; SIG-PAYEE
OR
HTLC-TIMEOUT &amp; SIG-PAYER
OR
REVOCATION-B &amp; SIG A

Now, I thought it wouldn't be OK to add an OP_CSV there, so let's see if
I can exploit it.

Same situation: Alice and Eve, connected with two channels. Eve performs
a payment to herself, routed through these two channels.

Now, Eve allows the transaction to succeed on the channel where she
receives: Eve sends the R value to Alice, and Alice sends Eve a commit
transaction update where the HTLC is removed and Eve receives the funds.

On the other channel, Alice sends the R value to Eve, but Eve does not
send Alice a commit transaction update. In fact, Eve becomes completely
unresponsive on this channel. This forces Alice to broadcast her commit
transaction, containing the HTLC. She has to do this *before* the CLTV
of the HTLC times out, or otherwise Eve can try to claim the HTLC funds.

Now, the question is: which times out first, Alice's CSV or Eve's CLTV?
The one that times out first will be the first to be able to claim the
funds. This *should* of course be Alice, so Alice's CSV should be the
first to time out.

Let's assume the HTLC timeout is T0 + 1 day on the channel where Eve
receives, T0 + 2 days on the channel where Eve sends. Eve wants to delay
Alice's commit transaction as long as possible, so she sends the R value
just before T0 + 1 day. That means Alice's CSV should have a delay *less
than* one day. If the CSV delay is set to 0.5 day, that means Alice has
a remaining 0.5 day time window in which her node must be up and running
and connected to the Bitcoin network, to claim the HTLC funds.

So, I think it *is possible*. However, this leads to some uncomfortable
time trade-offs. The CSV delay determines how often your node must be up
and running, to catch the use of revoked commit transactions. Longer is
better: I'd be much more comfortable with 30 days than with 1 day. The
HTLC timeout increment determines how long funds can be locked up and
payment status can stay undetermined (worst-case); it adds up over the
entire route. For this, shorter is better: 1 day would be much better
than 30 days.

Even if you assume &quot;always-on, always connected&quot; nodes, e.g. cell
phones, service providers and home servers, you have to take into
account that systems can fail, and manual intervention may be needed to
restore them. The downtime / DoS attack -&gt; theft escalation is something
we don't want to happen.
