Only once you've sent the signature; they ack the signature with the old
revocation preimage.  It's a single-RTT window.

</I>
I don't think anything can save a node which goes offline in the middle
of an exchange.  Not sure this makes it worse?

&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> optimizing against payment failure on the ADD side, as failure may
</I>&gt;<i> require a re-route in the opposite direction to do a full cancel with a
</I>&gt;<i> non-responsive node in multi-hop payments (as an add request/accept
</I>&gt;<i> structure has lower time windows for going offline).
</I>
I'm not convinced the re-route scheme will be used in practice.  We're
probably going to need to distinguish (for fee reasons) payments
expected to resolve quickly, and those expected to take a long time.
Re-routing in the opposite direction is worst case: it ties up funds for
a long time with no actual likely redemption, thus would require a large
up-front fee.

I think in practice, if a node goes down with possibly-live HTLCs, those
HTLCs get delayed.  The node loses channels, too, so it's not free for
them either.

&gt;<i> However, I agree if
</I>&gt;<i> both nodes are well connected, then this is more optimal if latency is
</I>&gt;<i> the primary concern.
</I>
This offers 3x inter-node latency, which is optimal AFAICT (I know I
talked about cut-through, but while possible for route discovery it
turns out not to help total end-to-end commit latency).

As I said before, I was unsure on your commitment scheme, so maybe I'm
missing a trick?

Thanks!
Rusty.
