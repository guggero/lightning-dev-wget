&gt;<i> Same situation: Alice and Eve, connected with two channels. Eve performs
</I>&gt;<i> a payment to herself, routed through these two channels.
</I>
Okay, so the channels are:

   Eve &lt;-&gt; Alice
   Evelyn &lt;-&gt; Alice  (Eve's alias)

with the delay (OP_CSV) parameter for both channels set at the value
&quot;D&quot;. In addition, Alice's commitments include a fee that she expects will
result in confirmation in less than a delay of &quot;F&quot;, and she's confident
that a transaction can be spent so long as its been in the blockchain for
&quot;N&quot; units of time.

The HTLCs are:

   Eve pays Alice $X on receipt of R, CLTV at time T
   Alice pays Evelyn $X on receipt of R, CLTV at time T'

Per the mail above, when forwarding the HTLC, Alice calculates T' such that

   T' &lt;= T - D - 2*F - N

and

   T' &gt;= now + D + F

&gt;<i> Now, Eve allows the transaction to succeed on the channel where she
</I>&gt;<i> receives: Eve sends the R value to Alice, and Alice sends Eve a commit
</I>&gt;<i> transaction update where the HTLC is removed and Eve receives the funds.
</I>
Assuming that all works out, and Evelyn reveals R and collects $X straight
away, the second HTLC is dealt with, and things are fine so far.

&gt;<i> On the other channel, Alice sends the R value to Eve, but Eve does not
</I>&gt;<i> send Alice a commit transaction update. In fact, Eve becomes completely
</I>&gt;<i> unresponsive on this channel.
</I>
At this point Alice should start the timer ticking. If she doesn't get
an ack from Eve prior to T-D-F, she must go to the blockchain. Suppose
she leaves it to the last minute.

&gt;<i> This forces Alice to broadcast her commit
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, containing the HTLC. She has to do this *before* the CLTV
</I>&gt;<i> of the HTLC times out, or otherwise Eve can try to claim the HTLC funds.
</I>
So she publishes her commitment transaction at T-D-F. The transaction
gets mined before &quot;F&quot; time units transpire, so the time is now T-D-x.
After an additional &quot;D&quot; time units, the time is T-x, at which point Alice
can spend the transaction, but Eve cannot.

&gt;<i> Now, the question is: which times out first, Alice's CSV or Eve's CLTV?
</I>&gt;<i> The one that times out first will be the first to be able to claim the
</I>&gt;<i> funds. This *should* of course be Alice, so Alice's CSV should be the
</I>&gt;<i> first to time out.
</I>
So I think that answers the question.

&gt;<i> Let's assume the HTLC timeout is T0 + 1 day on the channel where Eve
</I>&gt;<i> receives, T0 + 2 days on the channel where Eve sends. 
</I>
In that case, from the above inequalities:

   D + 2*F + N &lt;= 1 day

&gt;<i> Eve wants to delay
</I>&gt;<i> Alice's commit transaction as long as possible, so she sends the R value
</I>&gt;<i> just before T0 + 1 day.
</I>
That doesn't work: if the forwarded HTLC isn't resolved by T'-D-F she
has to close the channel on the blockchain to be safe. If her fees are
high enough, D+F could perhaps be as low as an hour, though, so T0+23
hours might be reasonable.

&gt;<i> That means Alice's CSV should have a delay *less
</I>&gt;<i> than* one day. If the CSV delay is set to 0.5 day, that means Alice has
</I>&gt;<i> a remaining 0.5 day time window in which her node must be up and running
</I>&gt;<i> and connected to the Bitcoin network, to claim the HTLC funds.
</I>
Yes, rearranging the inequality above gives D &lt;= (T-T') - 2*F - N, so
it has to be quite a bit smaller than the delta between timeouts across
a given node.

Cheers,
aj
