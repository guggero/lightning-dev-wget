I would simply disallow skipping as a protocol violation.

I think this approach also leads neatly to an gentler close protocol:
sending close would simply imply the initiator would send no more adds,
and reject all received.  It could take a while to clean out all the
remaining HTLCs for mutual close (assuming we still don't support close
with htlcs), but at least the other side knows what we're doing and
can open new channels to replace capacity if it wants to.

I'm going to try to document your protocol in another mail, let's see
how close I get this time!

Thanks,
Rusty.
