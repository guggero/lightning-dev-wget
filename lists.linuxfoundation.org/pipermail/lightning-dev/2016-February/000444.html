&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've had another look at C-Lightning protocol description[1], in the
</I>&gt;<i> hope to make a sort of match between your message types and the message
</I>&gt;<i> types in Amiko Pay. In the best case, there would be a near-perfect
</I>&gt;<i> match; in the worst case, the entire sequence would be different
</I>&gt;<i> (unlikely, since we try to accomplish similar things).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result was a bit unexpected: there was hardly any match at all, but
</I>&gt;<i> this was not due to solving things in different ways, but because of
</I>&gt;<i> implementing nearly opposite subsets of the functionality of Lightning.
</I>
Indeed!  I kind of like that we're approaching from opposite ends, it
means we can steal off each other.

&gt;<i> For me, this was a bit of an eye-opener, though I should have expected
</I>&gt;<i> it, from what I know about C-Lightning. C-Lightning's protocol
</I>&gt;<i> description will be a nice guide for developing a true Lightning style
</I>&gt;<i> channel in Amiko Pay. Judging the development time and lines of code in
</I>&gt;<i> C-lightning, I guess the part that is implemented in C-lightning has
</I>&gt;<i> quite a bit of complexity, so I hope to build on Rusty's experience and
</I>&gt;<i> expertise, to do things a bit faster in Amiko Pay.
</I>
Yes.  I'm right now reworking it to do the update pipelining, and it's
removed some of the complexity.  But it's not complete yet, so some
might come back :)

I'm off on paternity leave for a couple of weeks, but I've pushed my
unworking code to the multi-htlc branch, so you can see the changes in
the protocol as per my email to the list.

Cheers!
Rusty.
