&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * Message confirmation: this is done manually (instead of relying on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; TCP), so that a node knows which messages were received / need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; re-transmitted, even after a crash + restart.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the protocol itself needs to be robust against retransmissions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's no way to know if the other side received your acknowledgement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before a crash, so you will always need to handle duplication on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-establishment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Amiko Pay does that: It assigns a number to every message, and the
</I>&gt;<i> receiving side can confirm &quot;I've received up to this number&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Not-yet-confirmed messages will be retransmitted, and the receiving
</I>&gt;<i> sides will ignore duplicates (except it will send a confirmation again,
</I>&gt;<i> in case the previous confirmation was lost).
</I>
Yes, I think packet numbers make sense.  I encoded the packet length and
order in one single value (ie. byte counter at the end of this packet),
but it's too weird for too little gain IMHO.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * There is not only two-way communication between linked peers, but also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; between payer and payee. This is necessary for Amiko Pay's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; bi-directional routing, but also useful e.g. for transmitting meta-data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that doesn't fit in a QR code. Amiko Pay transmits an arbitrary-contents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;receipt&quot; from payee to payer; in the future, this might be digitally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; signed by the payee, as a &quot;proof of transfer of ownership&quot; of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; non-cryptographic goods.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree.  There's room in the initial onion design for payer -&gt; payee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages, but we don't have a channel for responses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't see an easy way to implement the payee --&gt; payer comms reliably:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be reliable it would have to be published on-chain in the commit tx.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Which we could do by constructing HTLCs such that they require a blob
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signed by the payee, but that's tracable ...).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mats and Laolu wanted to add an arbitrary comms protocol layer, but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that's something we can defer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Amiko Pay, payer &lt;-&gt; payee communication is done on a direct TCP
</I>&gt;<i> stream between them. Note that this also reduces latency: once
</I>&gt;<i> transaction locking reaches the payee, the payee knows (s)he's capable
</I>&gt;<i> of claiming the money, and can tell the payer that the payment is
</I>&gt;<i> completed. If reduced latency is in the interest of the payee, this is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to happen.
</I>
I think for v1.0 of the protocol we'll be assuming such a channel for
simplicity; that somehow the R hash and route is known by the payer.

&gt;<i> On latency: what latency do you think is needed for different use cases,
</I>&gt;<i> and what can we reach? Does this extra step really make a difference?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My estimate is that we'll typically have 10 hops (&quot;six degrees of
</I>&gt;<i> separation&quot; theory), and 100ms to transmit a message(*) over one hop.
</I>...
&gt;<i> (*) Not counting sending the confirmation back: a node that receives a
</I>&gt;<i> message can immediately forward a message on the next hop; message
</I>&gt;<i> confirmation on the receiving side can occur in parallel.
</I>
That's a good point; you can offer the next hop and abort if the prior
hop fails to deliver a signature.  Nice, my estimates were double
yours...

&gt;<i> Without reserving, you need to traverse all hops once(**) (the locking
</I>&gt;<i> operation) before payer(***)+payee know that the transaction has
</I>&gt;<i> succeeded. Actual settlement on the channels happens afterwards, but is
</I>&gt;<i> no longer critical for the latency as seen by payer+payee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With reserving, you need to traverse all hops three times(**), in the
</I>&gt;<i> worst case that the meeting point is on one of the end points of the
</I>&gt;<i> route: once for making the route and reserving funds, once for
</I>&gt;<i> confirming that the route has been established and once for locking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, instead of one second, a transaction might take three seconds. Is
</I>&gt;<i> that a game changer? Maybe it is for e.g. public transport access gates,
</I>&gt;<i> where passenger throughput is essential. But then, people could reduce
</I>&gt;<i> latency a lot by having a direct channel with the public transport
</I>&gt;<i> operator.
</I>
I worry that higher latency is a centralization pressure, and encourages
people to sacrifice privacy.  I don't know where the threshold is,
though, so currently I'm more nervous about complexity :)

Cheers,
Rusty.
