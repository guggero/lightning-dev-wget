</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With an OP_CSV on both sides of HTLCs, you can make a somewhat

Fair point.  The issue will improve when we have close with outstanding
HTLCs.  Meanwhile it disturbs me that the party which goes offline pays
the least penalty; their counterparties have their funds tied though.

Cheers,
Rusty.
