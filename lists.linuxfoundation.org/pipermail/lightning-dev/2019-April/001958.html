<PRE>Good morning Pierre and list,

&gt;<i>     There is another unrelated issue: because trampoline nodes don't know
</I>&gt;<i>     anything about what happened before they received the onion, they may
</I>&gt;<i>     unintentionnaly create overlapping routes. So we can't simply use the
</I>&gt;<i>     payment_hash as we currently do, we would have to use something a bit
</I>&gt;<i>     more elaborate.
</I>
Just to be clear, the issue is for example with a network like:


    A ------- B -------- C
             / \
            /   \
           /     \
          /       \
         D ------- E

Then, A creates an inner trampoline onion &quot;E-&gt;C&quot;, and an outer onion &quot;A-&gt;B-&gt;E&quot;.

E, on receiving the inner trampoline onion &quot;E-&gt;C&quot;, finds that E-&gt;B direction is low capacity, so routes over the outer onion &quot;E-&gt;D-&gt;B-&gt;C&quot; with inner trampoline onion &quot;C&quot;.

This creates an overall route A-&gt;B-&gt;E-&gt;D-&gt;B-&gt;C.

When the B-&gt;C HTLC is resolved, B can instead claim the A-&gt;B HTLC and just fail the D-&gt;B HTLC, thereby removing D and E from the route and claiming their fees, even though they participated in the route.

&gt;<i> (maybe private keys?)
</I>
Do you refer to the changing from &quot;H&quot;TLC to &quot;P&quot;TLC point-locked timelocked contracts?
i.e. instead of payment hash / preimage, we use payment point / scalar.

I think a few ideas would be improved by this.

1.  Trampoline payments, as described above.
2.  Offline vending machines
    - Instead of storing a fixed number of invoices from the always-online payment node, store a HD parent point and derive child points for payments.
3.  Enables payment decorrelation.

Perhaps we should consider switching to payment points/scalars sometime soon.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
