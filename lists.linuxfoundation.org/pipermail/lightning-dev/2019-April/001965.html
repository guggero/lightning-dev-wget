<PRE>Good morning list,


&gt;<i> Could this be implemented by replacing only the front of the trampoline-level onion?
</I>&gt;<i> (presumably with some adjustment of how the HMAC is computed for the new trampoline layer)
</I>
I am trying to design a trampoline-level onion that would allow replacement of the first hop of the onion.

Below is what I came up with.
As I am neither a cryptographer nor a mathematician, I am unable to consider, whether this may have some problem in security.

Now the &quot;normal&quot; onion, the first hop is encrypted to the recipient.

I propose that for the &quot;inner&quot; trampoline-level onion, the first hop be sent &quot;in the clear&quot;.
I think this is still secure, as the &quot;inner&quot; trampoline-level onion will still be wrapped by the outer link-level onion, which would still encrypt it.

When a node receives a trampoline-level onion, it checks if it is the first hop.
If it is, then it decrypts the rest of the onion and tries to route to the next trampoline-level node.
If not, then it is being delegated to, to find the trampoline.

If the node cannot find the front of the trampoline-level onion, then it can route it to another node that it suspects is more likely to know the destination (such as the mechanisms in discussion in the &quot;Routemap Scaling&quot; thread).

Let me provide a concrete example.

Payer Z creates a trampoline-level onion C-&gt;D-&gt;E:

C | Z | encrypt(Z * C, D | encrypt(Z * D, E))

Then Z routes to link-level onion A-&gt;B-&gt;C, with the payload to C being the above trampoline-level onion:

encrypt(Z * A, &quot;link level&quot; | B | encrypt(Z * B, &quot;link level&quot; | C | encrypt(Z * C, &quot;trampoline level&quot; | C | Z | encrypt(Z * C, D | encrypt(Z * D, E)))))

Upon reaching C, it sees it is given a trampoline-level onion, and if C is unable to find D in its local map, it can delegate it to some other node.

For example, if C thinks its neighbor M knows D, it can create:

encrypt(C * M, &quot;link level&quot; | M | encrypt(C * M, &quot;trampoline level&quot; | D | Z | encrypt(Z * D, E)))

M finds that it is not the first hop in the trampoline-level onion.
So M finds a route to D, for example via M-&gt;N-&gt;D, and gives:

encrypt(M * N, &quot;link level&quot; | D | encrypt(M * D, &quot;trampoline level&quot; | D | Z | encrypt(Z * D, E)))

Is this workable?
Note that it seems to encounter the same problem as Rendezvous Routing.
I assume it is possible to do this somehow (else how would hidden services in Tor work?), but the details, I am uncertain of.
I only play a cryptographer on Internet.

ZmnSCPxj
