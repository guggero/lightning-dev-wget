Alice, Bob and Carol sure seem simpler than Zmn YAI and Rusty...

It would have made more sense to me for Alice (Zmn) to generate
the nonce, hash it, and prepare the onion, so that the nonce is
revealed to Dave (Rusty) if/when the message ever actually reaches its
destination. Otherwise Rusty has to send AAAAA to Zmn already so that
Zmn can prepare the onion?

I'm not sure why lucky hashing should result in a discount? You're
giving a linear discount for exponentially more luck in hashing which
also seems odd.

You've only got two nonce choices -- the initial AAAA and the depth
that you tell Bob and Carol to hash to as steps in the route; so the
incentive there seems to be to do a large depth, so you might hash
AAAA 1000 times, and figure that you'll find a leading eight 0's once
in the first 256 entries, then another by the time you get up to 512,
and another by the time you get to 768, which gets you discounts on
three intermediaries. But the cost there is that your intermediaries
collectively have to do the same amount of hashing you did, so it's not
proof-of-work, because it's as hard to verify as it is to generate.

I think you could just make the scheme be:

  Alice sends HTLC(k,v) + 1250 msat to Bob
  Bob unwraps the onion and forwards HTLC(k,v) + 500 msat to Carol
  Carol unwraps the onion and forwards HTLC(k,v) + 250 msat to Dave
  Dave redeems the HTLC, claims an extra 300 msat and refunds 200 msat to Carol
  Carol redeems the HTLC and refunds 200 msat to Bob
  Bob redeems the HTLC and refunds 200 msat to Alice

If there's a failure, Alice loses the 1250 msat, and someone in the
path steals the funds. You could make the accountable by having Alice
also provide &quot;Hash(AAAA, refund=200)&quot; to everyone, encoding AAAA in the
onion to Dave, and then each hop reveals AAAA and refunds 200msat to
demonstrate their honesty.

Does that miss anything that all the hashing achieves?

I think the idea here is that you're paying tiny amounts for the
bandwidth, which when it's successful does in fact pay for the bandwidth;
and when it's unsuccessful results in a channel closure, which makes it
unprofitable to cheat the system, but doesn't change the economics of
lightning much overall because channel closures can happen anytime anyway.
I think that approach makes sense.

Cheers,
aj
