&gt;<i> Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We spoke in detail about this after your presentation at LNconf. I'm one of
</I>&gt;<i> the contributors to LNURL so I am a little familiar with what you're trying
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve and am very grateful you're considering implementing something
</I>&gt;<i> similar to the mainnet protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can only see delivery address being a nightmare for the network or wallet
</I>&gt;<i> providers. If you take a quick look at any Shopify website right now and
</I>&gt;<i> try to buy something to be delivered you will see validation of address
</I>&gt;<i> inputs before accepting payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the 'expected' UX of consumer applications in 2019. If offers were
</I>&gt;<i> to not validate address inputs correctly the user will not receive the
</I>&gt;<i> product, lose money, and have a [very] negative review of both the
</I>&gt;<i> wallet-providing and the offer-providing businesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Handling these UX expectations will require either the wallet provider or
</I>&gt;<i> the offer provider to validate the inputs before proceeding with the sale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. If the offer provider handles validation then the network will have
</I>&gt;<i>    to accommodate potentially infinite validation attempts (big no no I assume)
</I>&gt;<i>    2. If the wallet provider were to provide the UX for input validation
</I>&gt;<i>    they are taking on significant workload to develop a robust address input
</I>&gt;<i>    UI, but more importantly the responsibility to correctly validate. There is
</I>&gt;<i>    plenty of room to screw up and create a catastrophic user experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think address validation input is only possible via 2. but I think it
</I>&gt;<i> is too much workload and responsibility to expect from wallet providers.
</I>
This is not the area I worry about, TBH, since every shopping website in
existence has implemented address input (and some form of validation).
I'm sure it'll be primitive to start with.

Of course, UBL has a standard 'AddressType' too:

        <A HREF="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.2/xsd/common/UBL-CommonAggregateComponents-2.2.xsd">http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.2/xsd/common/UBL-CommonAggregateComponents-2.2.xsd</A>

&gt;&gt;<i>From what I can see, it would not be impossible to bring delivery address
</I>&gt;<i> functionality into offers retroactively after offers was already in prod.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps icebox it?
</I>
Quite possibly something we can delay; most current goods are virtual
anyway.  However, delivery address standardization would greatly improve
the UX for such things.

Cheers,
Rusty.
