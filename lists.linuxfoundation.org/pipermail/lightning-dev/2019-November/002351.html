<PRE>Good morning Orfeas,

The thread is now off-topic, thus I changed the subject.

&gt;<i> &gt; This can be made &quot;the same&quot; by any of the following methods:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -   Burning the up-front fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would impose a hard maximum of 21 * 10^6 * 10^8 global lifetime hops, and a much lower practical one. PoW OTOH doesn't impose such limits. Hence different dynamics.
</I>
Granted, but do note that we can trivially &quot;move the decimal&quot;.
Perhaps not &quot;trivially&quot; but it is possible to do so, thus still the same overall dynamics.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -   Locking the up-front fees for a time, then reverting them to the original sender.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that I can burst-spam today, wait until unlock, repeat. If the PoW scheme somehow enforces fresh PoWs (e.g. by needing (nonce || recent block hash) as proof), I can't do this attack.
</I>
But in order for PoW to actively limit spam, the PoW target must be high enough that you can burst-spam today, wait until you get your *next* passes-the-threshold PoW, repeat.
The difference is that PoW has more variance, but that variance itself can limit non-spam usage (in much the same way that too high an up-front locktime would also limit non-spam usage).

I do not think you can get better than this, given the physics of this universe.
Money represents the allocation of available energy (by the simple mechanism of purchasing energy using money; the invisible hand is really the mechanism which directs energy towards the production of goods that are demanded), and PoW is a proof that somebody allocated available energy for the production of the PoW.
I do not know what argument you would consider &quot;formal enough&quot; but that is the only argument I have, and I find it sufficient.

Would this be enough?

We postulate that there is an amount of energy E, whose consumption produces a proof-of-work we can present on network, and that this required amount of consumed energy E is sufficient to deter spam.
The proof-of-work attesting to this energy E can be bought in a sufficiently mature market, using money, and thus this amount of energy E has some equivalent market price of money M, the spending of which is sufficient to deter spam.
If spending amount M was not sufficient to deter spam, or equivalently if M is too cheap to deter spam, then spammers will spend M to get E to drive proof-of-work instead of deriving their proof-of-work directly, increasing demand for energy until the market price of E becomes M' such that M' is sufficiently high enough to deter spam.

Or in simpler terms: with a stable enough monetary system and market, you can buy PoW, thus PoW and fees are equivalent.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
