</I>There are situations when lot of people need to send each other lot of
messages in a small period of time, in protests for instance. In this
case, people are ready to pay a little to communicate. It's true that
they can be censored even when paying for messaging, but in this case,
it's a voluntary (and politic) decision. But when using a rate limiting
mechanism, it's an economic decision with politic implications.

</I>
Currently, if you install a smtp server in you home computer or in a
server you rent and you try to send an email to someone with an email
from any big provider, it will be marked as spam, because you need to
have a good &quot;reputation&quot;. And if you try to send so called &quot;marketing&quot;
emails, you'll be marked as spammer even if the same emails sent by big
providers are not rejected. This is the effect of using any reputation
system. The path from reputation to propaganda is very short.

&gt;<i> One difference is that afaik emails don't traverse a path through
</I>&gt;<i> multiple mail &quot;nodes&quot;. Another is that inboxes of users are very
</I>&gt;<i> centralized (gmail and co).
</I>
I can imagine a system where people who want to use the messaging system
based on Lightning will have to open a channel to big nodes in order to
be able to reach their recipient. In this case, those big nodes can
censor as they want because they have access to a lot of metadata.
