</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; simplify this to a single to_self_delay that is proposed by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initiator,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but what was the original reason to allow distinct values?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because I didn't fight hard enough for simplicity :(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the people you were fighting with, what reason did they have? Just
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility in general, or was there an actual use case? Maybe these people
</I>&gt;<i> are reading this email and can comment?
</I>
Compromise among the committee meant adding everything to the spec if
there was a conceivable reason for it; the simplicity argument was less
strong then (maybe because we hadn't implemented it all yet!).

&gt;<i> So then because unilateral close is the only way to resolve atm, it is
</I>&gt;<i> correct also in theory that there will never be a commitment tx where the
</I>&gt;<i> non-initiator pays fees? But the point is clear, channels can get stuck.
</I>
Yeah.  Generally, it doesn't happen because we insist on a reasonable
balance in the channel, but it's theoretically possible.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If we hard-code a constant, we won't be able to adapt to changes of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; `dustRelayFee` in the bitcoin network. And we'd also need to deal with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; peer picking a value higher than that constant for its regular funding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; dust limit parameter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that we can't adapt to dustRelayFee *today*, since we can't change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it after funding (another thing we probably need to fix).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can't for an existing channel, but at least for a new channel you can
</I>&gt;<i> pick a different value. Which wouldn't be possible if we'd put a fixed
</I>&gt;<i> (anchor) amount in the spec.
</I>
That's not really much consolation though for the existing network.

Still Matt assures me that the relay dust limit is not going to change,
so I think we're best off cutting down our test matrix by choosing a
value and putting it directly into the spec.

By my calculations, at minfee it will cost you ~94 satoshis to spend.
Dust limit is 294 for Segwit outputs (basically assuming 3x minfee).

So I'm actually happy to say &quot;anchor outputs are 294 satoshi&quot;.  These
are simply spendable, and still only $3 each if BTC is $1M.  Lower is
better (as long as we stick with funder-pays), as long as they do
eventually get spent.

&gt;&gt;<i> If we really want to make it adjustable, could we make each side pay for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its own; if you can't afford it, you don't get one?  There's no point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the funder paying for a fundee-anchor if the fundee has no skin in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> game.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That reduces the pressure somewhat, I think?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't afford you don't get one, not sure about that. I could open a
</I>&gt;<i> channel, send out the total capacity an in htlc to myself via some other
</I>&gt;<i> hops, force close with a very low commit fee, then pull in the htlc (one
</I>&gt;<i> time the money). The victim then needs to get the commit confirmed to claim
</I>&gt;<i> the money, but there is no anchor unfortunately. I wait for the htlc to
</I>&gt;<i> expire, then anchor down the commit tx and time out the htlc (twice the
</I>&gt;<i> money).
</I>
Excellent point.  And the complexity of some &quot;you can only use a little
bit of capacity until I have an anchor too&quot; is worse, so let's stick
with your proposal as the simplest: funder pays for two, always.

&gt;&gt;<i> Or what about we rotate the anchors and nothing else, which (assuming we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make it anyone-can-spend-after-N-blocks) reduces the amount of onchain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spam if someone completely loses their keys?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a bigger change, but maybe it's worth it?
</I>&gt;<i> We now have David's great proposal to reuse the funding keys for the anchor
</I>&gt;<i> output. That allows us to always let anyone spend after confirmation,
</I>&gt;<i> because they can reconstruct the spend script. But I think this also means
</I>&gt;<i> that we cannot do rotation on the anchor keys. We need to use the funding
</I>&gt;<i> pubkey as is.
</I>
I missed that proposal, thanks!

It's stronger than my scheme, in that it works even if neither anchor is
spent; which, if we keep update_fee, is a distinct possibility.  And
makes the script shorter (my fee calc above assume this).

We *could* tweak both anchors by the same amount, but then you'd still
need to see one of them to spend the other.

Cheers,
Rusty.
