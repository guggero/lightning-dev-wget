<PRE>Good morning Konstantin and yas,

Indeed, yas is quite correct: the money is still locked, and all that this proposal adds is to limit the funds locked by having S be a direct peer of the payer.
In the case proposed by Konstantin, this is simply locked between both A and S only, but it *must* be locked, or else timing shenanigans can be performed to defraud S.


A proposal, is to add some sort of `please_poll` flag TLV to Trampoline onions, where if `please_poll` is enabled for a Trampoline node, it will perform the above-mentioned polling of once every 6 blocks.
That way, any node that supports Trampoline *and* `please_poll` can work as an S (or Rod) for a possibly-offline next step.

Alternatively, Trampoline implementations might actually just implement the polling behavior automatically without a `please_poll` flag; this might be viable especially if the Trampoline is given a substantial fee and time budget anyway.


The only thing needed is for Trampoline to allow prepending of onions, then even the payee gets privacy from the payer.


Regards,
ZmnSCPxj

&gt;<i> [Resending in Plain Text. Sorry for the spam]
</I>&gt;<i> Hello Konstantin,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In asynchronous payments we want to be sure that there are only two states:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Before B received the payment.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  After B received the payment.
</I>&gt;<i>     In state 1), we want A to still have the control of the amount, and at
</I>&gt;<i>     the same time we want to let B decide (until a certain timeout) to
</I>&gt;<i>     receive the payment. In this state, S can only help B to be paid, or
</I>&gt;<i>     cancel the whole transfer, but in this case, A cannot lose the amount.
</I>&gt;<i>     In state 2), we want to be sure that no money is lost by S (and
</I>&gt;<i>     consequently that the amount in A wallet is decremented by amt).
</I>&gt;<i>     As ZmnSCPxj wrote in
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="../2019-October/002260.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-October/002260.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>     (as I understand the last sentences), there is no way to do that without
</I>&gt;<i>     locking the amount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In order to increase the privacy, we are improving the specification to
</I>&gt;<i>     be be able to use several Rod nodes: a list of nodes chosen by the payer
</I>&gt;<i>     and another list by the payee.
</I>&gt;<i>     The Rod nodes are supposed to be almost always online, so standard https
</I>&gt;<i>     can be used to communicate with them and between them.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently, both parties have to be online at the same time to send/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receive money. This can be avoided by using something like the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lightning Rod Protocol by Breez
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="https://github.com/breez/LightningRod">https://github.com/breez/LightningRod</A>). However, funds have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locked up longer than usual. We can do better than that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ---------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The payer A pre-signs a transaction handing over money to their local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channel partner S and sends the transaction to the payee B in an end
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to end encrypted communication channel. B can then sell the signature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the transaction to S using pay-for-signature made possible by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payment points and scalars.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="../2019-July/002077.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-July/002077.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We will be using eltoo because we don't have to worry about toxic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channel states.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A and S are online, A and S have a channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  A contacts S: they commit and exchange the R (= k*G) part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Schnorr Signature for the update and settlement transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  A and S sign the settlement transaction increasing the balance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     between them by amt + fee in favor of S and exchange the signatures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  A signs the corresponding update transaction but does not give it so S
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  A sends the update transaction to B using an end to end encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     asynchronous communication channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A can go offline
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B comes online
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  Decrypts the update transaction and sells the signature s to S for amt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When A comes back online S gives A the invoice (with the payment point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; s*G) signed by B, the corresponding scalar s (the signature from A for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the update transaction) and signature from S for the update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction. They can now proceed as normal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition to enabling asynchronous payments, this outsources the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routing to S.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ### Potential issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #### Privacy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; S currently knows both the sender and the receiver of the payment. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we split the payment from S to B into two payments between S and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public routing node P and P and B by still using the same scalar +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payment point, S now only knows the sender and P only knows the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receiver. To further increase privacy we can split the payment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple times but all nodes involved must support this feature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #### Locked up capital
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While B hasn't yet claimed its money, the funds in the channel between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A and S are essentially locked up. However, A and S could simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overwrite the payment (new update + settlement transaction), then A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could send multiple payments with the remaining balance and before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going offline A would do the procedure again. If A has sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inbound capacity in other channels it can also re-balance its channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A-S so that the outbound capacity - (amt + fees) in this channel is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; zero and then do the procedure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #### Communication channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obviously, the communication channel must be end to end encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; otherwise this is highly insecure. Hopefully, we will have a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decentralized paid mail server system which is compatible across all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LN wallets and part of BOLT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #### Proof of payment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The invoice by B with the payment point s*G and s are not sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a PoP because S can simply give A the invoice and A already knows s.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the other way around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ---------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can also do it in a way that A can instantly send B (who is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offline) money but now A is in charge of enforcing the channel state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if S cheats. Because it has more issues like who pays the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fees if S cheats and because I believe Lightning is generally not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; designed for people who are offline for a long time I prefer the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one. But here is the other one:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B and S are online, B and S have a channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  B and S sign a new settlement transaction increasing balance in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     favor of B by amt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  B signs the corresponding update transaction, encrypts it and sends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     it together with the settlement transaction to A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B can go offline
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A comes online
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  A decrypts the transactions, A pays S to sign the update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     transaction which makes this new channel state valid/ enforceable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  now A essentially acts like a watchtower while B is offline
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Conclusion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -----------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This enables truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and is yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another reason to move to payment points and scalars.
