<PRE>Hi all,


Since starting to hack on LDK, I&#8217;ve been interested in running some
components of a Lightning node in a dedicated hardware environment, in the
image of what is done by the smart card industry. We have been doing a
bunch of refactoring in that sense early on to isolate our signing
operations [0].

Building on top of this generic signing interface, the Validating Lightning
Signer has been growing into a mature Lightning signer during the past
years, performing a comprehensive set of policy checks to ensure the keys
are not misused [1]. The module development is advanced enough to be
functional with both deployment of LDK and CLN nodes (waiting internal
refactoring by other implementations for eventual support).

During the past months, in cooperation with the VLS project team, I&#8217;ve done
a third-party security audit of VLS core mechanisms, evaluating its state
of readiness for production by the community of Lightning node operators.

The critical vulnerabilities and attacks vectors found are the following:


- The legacy `option_anchor_outputs` is accepted by the Signer, there is no
protection against channel opening downgrades to unsafe channel type. This
opens the way to the known fee siphoning attack capturing almost all
channel value in function of capacity [2].

- The Signer does not enforce an upper bound on the sum of trimmed HTLC as
miner fees. This opens the way to the known dust inflate attack capturing a
minority of channel value if the adversary has low-hashrate capabilities
[3].

- There is a lack of a `policy-cltv-delta-reasonable` rule for routing
hops. There is no enforcement of a reasonable `cltv_expiry_delta` between
inbound HTLC and outbound HTLC, where reasonable is defined according to
the BOLT2&#8217;s `cltv_expiry_delta` selection recommendations [4]. This opens
the way to HTLC-double-spend attack where up to
`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat` of channel value can be captured.


- There is a lack of verification of `nLocktime` field soundness of the
HTLC-timeout at counterparty signature reception. This opens the way to
HTLC value freezing or double-spend in function of the deployment

- There is a lack of rejection of non-Segwit input for the funding
transaction. This opens the way to known freezing of full channel value by
the counterparty [5].

- The Signer is suffering from high-exposure to a fee-siphoning attack by
an adversary with minimal hashrate capabilities (i.e 1 block without time
boundary). Both funding/commitment transactions weights and feerate can be
inflated to increase the absolute fee signed.

Beyond that, there are still missing not-implemented critical policy rules
and the invoices and payments flows are still hardened with a consistent
security model. Those issues were known by the project.

The issues have been communicated to the VLS team ahead of the report
publication and they&#8217;re committed to address them.


The full audit report can be found here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ariard/validating-lightning-signer/blob/main/VLS-audit-v0.2.pdf">https://github.com/ariard/validating-lightning-signer/blob/main/VLS-audit-v0.2.pdf</A>

In the future, as the LN ecosystem matures, extended policies are expected
to be introduced covering the variety of LN use-cases: merchant, mobile,
routing nodes, LSP, where the policy set of rules could bind to the
application logic. E.g as BOLT12 offers to introduce a richer semantic on
payment protocol, the request structure could be enforced by the VLS [6].
Moreover, other data flows could be submitted to VLS to detect anomalies,
such as the historical mempools data in a compressed way.

Beyond Lightning node security, the VLS architecture could be generalized
to other Bitcoin contracting protocols (e.g vaults), where spending
policies are also leveraged to introduce fine-grained control of custodied
Bitcoin funds between cold and warm wallets.


Cheers,

Antoine
