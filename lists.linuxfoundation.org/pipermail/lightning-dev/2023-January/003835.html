<PRE>Hi Clara,


(Reply 1/2 - Apparently there is a limit of 80KB on Lightning mailing post)


&gt;<i>  * They will likely require a network wide upgrade: when a sender
</I>
&gt;<i>    makes a payment, the full path will need to understand the new
</I>
&gt;<i>    feature bit for it to be used.
</I>

I believe the upgradeability dimension is different both for circuit breaker
and staking credentials -- Circuit breaker is a point-level deployment and
can be rolled out without cooperation of the channel peers. Staking
credentials is end-to-end and just requires cooperation between endpoints
(HTLC senders and routing hops, not even all on the payment paths).


And I think upfront fees is a link-level one, probably the one requesting the
most cooperation between the community of developers/node operators.


Point-to-point/end-to-end deployment already provides benefits with
&quot;half-state&quot;
deployment, I think. However, you might have &quot;holistic&quot; beneficial effects
of link-level solutions (in terms of economic engineering not in terms of
software compatibility), I don't know.


&gt;<i>  * Sending nodes are unlikely to be incentivised to upgrade to
</I>
&gt;<i>    support a channel jamming mitigation, as jamming mitigations incur
</I>
&gt;<i>    additional cost (be it in the form of upfront fees, tokens or some
</I>
&gt;<i>    other mechanism).
</I>

As with any &quot;unpatched&quot; security risks we're encumbering on Lightning
(pinnings, time-dilation, etc), beyond clearly describing the attack in
reference documents and proof-of-concept of the attack against
implementations, the next step to keep raising awareness is a live demo as
much near as one can from really mainet conditions. While we were patching
CVE-2021-41591 and friends, I've been testing the solidity of the fixes on
the Eclair-side in a &quot;black-box&quot; manner. Always worth it, you learn on the
attack bounds.


We could do the same with jamming attacks, as there is a wide-range of
scenarios
to consider (network-wide/merchant/routing hops) and few optimizations
tricks like looping. Just have to be super careful with any demo exploits
toolchain, there is always a question of ethics here.


&gt;<i>  * Routing nodes have no way of knowing whether a payment comes from
</I>
&gt;<i>    a node that is not upgraded, or simply doesn't want to pay the
</I>
&gt;<i>    additional cost introduced by a jamming mitigation.
</I>

I think a routing node able to know if the payment sender has upgraded could
constitute a version/implementation fingerprint and a downgrade in HTLC traffic
privacy, ideally a routing node should not be able to link payeer/payee.


If a sender does not want to pay the jamming mitigation cost, it might be a
flaw in the incentive-compatibility benefit of a mitigation.


(And in terms of evaluating the
incentives-compatibility/economic-efficiency of any solution, we're going
to run quickly in hard questions of economic methodology, a bit beyond the
software engineering realm).


&gt;<i> It was generally agreed that the network is still in an early enough
</I>
&gt;<i> stage that it is fair for relaying nodes to initially upgrade but not
</I>
&gt;<i> enforce the feature, and later look at forwarding traffic to determine
</I>
&gt;<i> whether it is appropriate to require the feature.
</I>

If we look at the recent history of mempool policy upgrades on the
Bitcoin Core-side,
I think it's best practice to be more conservative in terms of &quot;smooth
feature&quot; deployment, even feature-gated beyond some node operator setting. At
time of feature enforcement, some node operators might claim an established
claim on other flows of HTLC traffic, and there would be a question of
backward-compatibility arising.


Independently, there is the fact on how discrepancies in feature activation
could be exploited (privacy-wise or economically-wise). Same issue we have
on the Bitcoin Core-side, when we update the mempool policy, and old nodes
might not see new types of outputs (e.g Taproot spends being non-standard
before the activation iirc).


&gt;<i> This will require sending nodes to opt-in to the new feature before the
</I>network can

&gt;<i> widely enforce it, as no rational routing node will require a feature
</I>
&gt;<i> which would reduce its ability to serve un-upgraded traffic (unless
</I>
&gt;<i> under attack, which is not the case at present).
</I>

I think the corollary holds -- A rational routing node will not require a
feature which would reduce its ability to serve upgraded traffic.


Note, I think the &quot;rational&quot; routing node could be better defined,
otherwise I think we'll run quickly in the same bottlenecked discussions
about &quot;policy rules&quot; compatible with miners incentives, as we're seeing on
the Core-side. So far, I don't think we have a consistent model of miners
incentives.


&gt;<i> A note was also made that wallets tend to upgrade less frequently, in
</I>
&gt;<i> part because some providers run forked versions of LN implementations,
</I>
&gt;<i> so this horizon may be quite long. It was emphasized that this type of
</I>
&gt;<i> network upgrade would require input from wallets, designers and
</I>
&gt;<i> application developers anyway, so hopefully by the time we look to
</I>
&gt;<i> deploy a change there is rough consensus among the Lightning community
</I>
&gt;<i> already.
</I>

Yeah, we have the same issues with transaction-relay/mempool policy or even the
non-really specified addr-relay strategy of Bitcoin Core, when there is

an upgrade there. It sounds to me there are no well-maintained public and open
communication channels where protocol developers can reach out to
wallet softwares
vendors for protocol upgrades feedback (and vice-versa). I don't know if
it's one goal of the LSP spec effort. If you're building a wallet, you're
probably going to assemble and maintain components from the two layers.


&gt;<i>  * Nodes can advertise custom upfront fee rates if desired, but to
</I>
&gt;<i>    save gossip bandwidth we assume a network-wide default of 1%.
</I>

I think you will have an additional issue here. The routing convergence delay
network-wide might be a bottleneck in how much fee rate variances you have
flexibility as a routing node operator. Routing convergence delays have
been studied in the past at 2,500 seconds for the worst-audience, I don't
think it's going to hold with network graph growth.


&gt;<i>  * Upfront fees accumulate along the route (as htlc payment amounts
</I>
&gt;<i>    do), and are simply pushed to the `to_remote` balance on
</I>
&gt;<i>    `update_add_htlc`.
</I>

I wonder if there is a concern of an &quot;upfront fee&quot; extraction issue at the
channel-level. You have Alice and you have Bob, Bob circular loop to
accumulate max `upfront_fee` on his `to_remote` balance on Alice's commitment
transaction. Then provoke a force-close by Alice to have her paying the
on-chain fees in the post-anchor output model.


There can be an interesting &quot;upfront fees&quot; siphoning issue here.


&gt;<i> The interaction between upfront fees and possible future protocol
</I>
&gt;<i> changes such as inbound fees and negative fees was briefly discussed,
</I>
&gt;<i> specifically the case where a node sets low (or negative) fees to
</I>
&gt;<i> attract traffic then fails payments to accumulate upfront fees. As is,
</I>
&gt;<i> all implementations&#8217; algorithms optimize for factors other than fees -
</I>
&gt;<i> specifically avoiding a node once it's produced failures - and we
</I>
&gt;<i> suspect that careful sender-side behavior will mitigate this risk.
</I>
&gt;<i> However, it was also acknowledged that a node that attempts this attack
</I>
&gt;<i> may be able to fool multiple individual senders and still be able to
</I>
&gt;<i> accumulate some fees.
</I>

Correcting upfront fees abuses sounds simple as long as you assume the scoring
is done by the endpoint. When you start to have gossip and routing scoring
delegation, you might be hijacked by an &quot;accumulating fees&quot; adversary. E.g,
one could sybil the rapid-gossip-sync servers, if their deployment becomes
ubiquitous [1]. Same issue with Electrum servers lack of incentives
alignment.


&gt;<i> However, Bob has no real incentive to forward the HTLC to Carol and
</I>
&gt;<i> push her the 4100 msat because that value is more than the fees he'll
</I>
&gt;<i> earn from successfully forwarding and settling the HTLC (10 msat
</I>
&gt;<i> upfront fees + 1000 msat success case fees). It's worth noting that
</I>
&gt;<i> this type of fee differential already exists in the network today - I
</I>
&gt;<i> got these example numbers by looking at the fee rates of the Loop
</I>
&gt;<i> node's peers [4].
</I>

Yes, &quot;fee differential&quot; issues have been discussed affecting upfront fees and
all the hold fees variants in the past. I'm not sure they're acceptable fee
risks, if you can exploit them by setting correctly the channel
topologies around
a victim routing hop.


End of 1/2.

</I>&gt;<i> This email attempts to summarize the discussion, but is of course
</I>&gt;<i> subject to my errors and opinions so the full transcript is available
</I>&gt;<i> at [1]. It is (imperfectly) AI generated, so please reach out to myself
</I>&gt;<i> or Clara if you'd like clarification for a specific section.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Upgrade Mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i> The first topic of discussion was around how we would go about
</I>&gt;<i> upgrading the network to support an anti-jamming mitigation. Most
</I>&gt;<i> solutions share the following characteristics:
</I>&gt;<i>   * They will likely require a network wide upgrade: when a sender
</I>&gt;<i>     makes a payment, the full path will need to understand the new
</I>&gt;<i>     feature bit for it to be used.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Sending nodes are unlikely to be incentivised to upgrade to
</I>&gt;<i>     support a channel jamming mitigation, as jamming mitigations incur
</I>&gt;<i>     additional cost (be it in the form of upfront fees, tokens or some
</I>&gt;<i>     other mechanism).
</I>&gt;<i>   * Routing nodes have no way of knowing whether a payment comes from
</I>&gt;<i>     a node that is not upgraded, or simply doesn't want to pay the
</I>&gt;<i>     additional cost introduced by a jamming mitigation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was generally agreed that the network is still in an early enough
</I>&gt;<i> stage that it is fair for relaying nodes to initially upgrade but not
</I>&gt;<i> enforce the feature, and later look at forwarding traffic to determine
</I>&gt;<i> whether it is appropriate to require the feature. This will require
</I>&gt;<i> sending nodes to opt-in to the new feature before the network can
</I>&gt;<i> widely enforce it, as no rational routing node will require a feature
</I>&gt;<i> which would reduce its ability to serve un-upgraded traffic (unless
</I>&gt;<i> under attack, which is not the case at present).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A note was also made that wallets tend to upgrade less frequently, in
</I>&gt;<i> part because some providers run forked versions of LN implementations,
</I>&gt;<i> so this horizon may be quite long. It was emphasized that this type of

</I>&gt;<i> application developers anyway, so hopefully by the time we look to
</I>&gt;<i> deploy a change there is rough consensus among the Lightning community
</I>&gt;<i> already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Upfront Fees
</I>&gt;<i> Next, we discussed the draft proposal for upfront fees [2] that
</I>&gt;<i> implements the first of a two-part jamming mitigation described in [3].
</I>&gt;<i> As it stands, the PR describes the simplest possible way to introduce
</I>&gt;<i> upfront fees to the protocol:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Upfront fees are expressed as a ppm of a channel's success-case
</I>&gt;<i>     fees, and charged on the outgoing link of a route.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Nodes can advertise custom upfront fee rates if desired, but to
</I>&gt;<i>     save gossip bandwidth we assume a network-wide default of 1%.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Upfront fees accumulate along the route (as htlc payment amounts
</I>&gt;<i>     do), and are simply pushed to the `to_remote` balance on
</I>&gt;<i>     `update_add_htlc`.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Final hop nodes advertise an upfront fee policy in bolt 11 invoices
</I>&gt;<i>     (or bolt 12 blinded routes) which is sufficiently padded to
</I>&gt;<i>     obfuscate their location in the route.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The interaction between upfront fees and possible future protocol
</I>&gt;<i> changes such as inbound fees and negative fees was briefly discussed,
</I>&gt;<i> specifically the case where a node sets low (or negative) fees to
</I>&gt;<i> attract traffic then fails payments to accumulate upfront fees. As is,
</I>&gt;<i> all implementations&#8217; algorithms optimize for factors other than fees -
</I>&gt;<i> specifically avoiding a node once it's produced failures - and we
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that careful sender-side behavior will mitigate this risk.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it was also acknowledged that a node that attempts this attack
</I>&gt;<i> may be able to fool multiple individual senders and still be able to
</I>&gt;<i> accumulate some fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We then discussed the shortcomings of the &quot;simplest possible&quot; upfront
</I>&gt;<i> fees in [2], specifically focused on the following scenario where
</I>&gt;<i> nodes receive 1% of their success-case fees as an upfront payment:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Alice is sending a payment to Dave, who is a popular sink node in
</I>&gt;<i>     the network.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Bob -&gt; Carol has low/default routing policy: 1000 msat success
</I>&gt;<i>     case / 10 msat upfront fee
</I>&gt;<i>   * Carol -&gt; Dave has high fees: 400,000 msat success case / 4000 msat
</I>&gt;<i>     upfront fee
</I>&gt;<i>   * Dave advertises no success case fee (is recipient) / 100 msat of
</I>&gt;<i>     upfront fee chosen for his invoice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice ------ Bob ------ Carol ------ Dave
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since we need to source all of these funds from the sender (Alice), the
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding of funds is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Alice pushes 4110 msat to Bob.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Bob _should_ push 4100 msat to Carol, claiming his 10 msat upfront
</I>&gt;<i>     fee.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Carol _should_ push 100 msat to Dave, claiming her 4000 msat
</I>&gt;<i>     upfront fee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Bob has no real incentive to forward the HTLC to Carol and
</I>&gt;<i> push her the 4100 msat because that value is more than the fees he'll
</I>&gt;<i> earn from successfully forwarding and settling the HTLC (10 msat
</I>&gt;<i> upfront fees + 1000 msat success case fees). It's worth noting that
</I>&gt;<i> this type of fee differential already exists in the network today - I
</I>&gt;<i> got these example numbers by looking at the fee rates of the Loop
</I>&gt;<i> node's peers [4].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were a few points discussed around this issue:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Whether we should look into a more complicated approach that
</I>&gt;<i>     includes a &quot;proof of forward&quot; secret in the next node's onion which
</I>&gt;<i>     must be supplied to claim the upfront fee.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Discussion about whether these order of magnitude fee differences
</I>&gt;<i>     will exist in an efficient market (differing opinions).
</I>&gt;<i>   * Whether Bob _would_ steal the upfront fee by dropping the payment,
</I>&gt;<i>     as it'll impact nodes' desire to route through them in future.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Is there a way to deliver upfront fees to nodes along the route
</I>&gt;<i>     *without* them adding up along the route (other than the naive
</I>&gt;<i>     version of sending each hop a payment, which comes with its own
</I>&gt;<i>     problems)? Seems not, but bright ideas are wanted and welcome!
</I>&gt;<i>   * That nodes will decide where they fall in the trade-off of setting
</I>&gt;<i>     upfront fees to cover their opportunity cost for high routing fees
</I>&gt;<i>     and market pressure to keep these fees low for the sake of
</I>&gt;<i>     remaining competitive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few people mentioned the desire to keep an upfront fee solution as
</I>&gt;<i> simple as possible, but generally it seemed that a solution where the
</I>&gt;<i> accumulated upfront fees at any point along a route exceed any single
</I>&gt;<i> hop's expected success case fees is unacceptable because incentives
</I>&gt;<i> are misaligned (even if we can properly attribute errors with [5]).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We touched briefly on a few &quot;proof of forwarding&quot; solutions for
</I>&gt;<i> upfront fees:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Using a locking mechanism that relies on a secret that is provided
</I>&gt;<i>     by the next node's onion.
</I>&gt;<i>   * A taproot tree for all HTLCs where each leaf has a subset of HTLCs,
</I>&gt;<i>     and fees could be incorporated here (summary note: apparently some
</I>&gt;<i>     work has been done here, but I couldn't find the link).
</I>&gt;<i>   * If we're confident that a more complicated solution will solve many
</I>&gt;<i>     problems, then we should pursue them, otherwise a simple solution
</I>&gt;<i>     is possibly a _good enough_ first step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was some discussion about how we want to go about addressing
</I>&gt;<i> spamming in the network:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Is it good enough to deploy something today that just charges a
</I>&gt;<i>     simple, capped upfront fee (eg 1 sat per hop) that solves jamming
</I>&gt;<i>     for the current state of the network and allows us to learn
</I>&gt;<i>     something then iterate?
</I>&gt;<i>   * Should our first attempt at solving this issue be for a future
</I>&gt;<i>     steady state where nodes have significant traffic and nodes face
</I>&gt;<i>     real opportunity cost (in the form of lost revenue) if they are
</I>&gt;<i>     targeted by a jamming attack?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Circuit Breaker Update
</I>&gt;<i>   * Circuit breaker has a UI now, and some issues are being opened in
</I>&gt;<i>     the repo so people have at minimum gone through the effort to spin
</I>&gt;<i>     it up.
</I>&gt;<i>   * It's still pretty manual, but it does provide node operators with
</I>&gt;<i>     information about the payment failures on their nodes (not easily
</I>&gt;<i>     surfaced in many LN UIs).
</I>&gt;<i>   * Hoping to get insights into stuck HTLCs and spam HTLCs so that we
</I>&gt;<i>     can learn from real life experience.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Circuit breaker is generally pushing in the same direction as the
</I>&gt;<i>     reputation scheme in [3], just a more manual one. We could
</I>&gt;<i>     possibly use it to visualize the endorsement system in [3] before
</I>&gt;<i>     enforcing it.
</I>&gt;<i>   * While circuit breaker isn't necessarily *the* solution to solving
</I>&gt;<i>     jamming on LN, it provides us with some data points and a
</I>&gt;<i>     practical way for individual operators to address spamming of
</I>&gt;<i>     their nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Tokens Update
</I>&gt;<i> Since our last discussion an architecture document was added to the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal [6], details in the mailing list post [7]. The main goal is
</I>&gt;<i> to try to dissociate the people paying the fees from those gaining the
</I>&gt;<i> benefits from the credentials, so that credentials can be paid by a
</I>&gt;<i> LSP (for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Reputation discussions in LSP Specification
</I>&gt;<i> Some attendees have been working on a reputation system for the LSP
</I>&gt;<i> specification group [8]. This system is intended to provide standard
</I>&gt;<i> metrics about what makes a node good/bad to connect to in the context
</I>&gt;<i> of a decentralized marketplace. While this work looks at the problem
</I>&gt;<i> from a different perspective, there's a possibility to consolidate
</I>&gt;<i> the efforts. It seems particularly useful in the anti-jamming case
</I>&gt;<i> where a node has newly connected to you, and needs a &quot;start state&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> reputation score. The idea of defining what qualifies as good
</I>&gt;<i> behavior in the Lightning Network is useful across the board. The
</I>&gt;<i> LSP specification group also has bi-weekly calls, and welcomes
</I>&gt;<i> additional participants!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Call Cadence
</I>&gt;<i> Attendees agreed to continue with calls every two weeks. General
</I>&gt;<i> consensus was that we would aim for a 30 minute meeting with the
</I>&gt;<i> option to extend to an hour if discussion warrants it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # What's next
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to everyone who attended last week's meeting, we hope to see
</I>&gt;<i> more folks in the next one!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot to discuss - brave readers who made it all the way to
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom of this email will notice a fair number of question marks
</I>&gt;<i> scattered about - and we're going to continue to break the problem
</I>&gt;<i> down into smaller parts to discuss in the hope of making progress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any change to the Lightning Network that aims to address channel
</I>&gt;<i> jamming attacks will be a significant (but necessary) change to the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, and it's going to need input from many different
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders. Please reach out here or in private
