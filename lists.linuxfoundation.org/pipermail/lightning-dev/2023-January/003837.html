<PRE>I am not sure to understand the current discussion about ordinals
relayed by the press, it's from my standpoint a no for storing things in
witness, and a no to use ordinals as a NFT system

Please remember that NFTs are not only electronic things, it can be real
things, or whatever you like, just referenced in the blockchain by a
&quot;double hash&quot; for my proposal

Bitcoin is currently completely out of the future: the so-called &quot;web3&quot;,
and lightning will not solve everything

Then please see my two proposals and comment, it's simple and easy to
read, and just complies with all comments related to/against the
ordinals proposal (storing things for my proposals in a good old
OP_RETURN the hashes and signatures only, not flooding bitcoin with
proofs of nothing, docs, images, etc), or just point out other better
systems based on bitcoin

It just shows again that bitcoin is better in all aspects compared to
other systems

I am not against ordinals but don't see it for &quot;web3&quot;


Le 26/01/2023 &#224; 21:15, Aymeric Vitte a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Please see:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A Bitcoin NFT system&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/Ayms/01dbfebf219965054b4a3beed1bfeba7">https://gist.github.com/Ayms/01dbfebf219965054b4a3beed1bfeba7</A> &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of this proposal is to propose a simple NFT system based on the
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin blockchain, assuming that the main purpose of a NFT is to be
</I>&gt;<i> sold/bought, but not only, it can be something that you keep for
</I>&gt;<i> yourself proving your ownership on the blockchain, or something that you
</I>&gt;<i> offer to someone else, the advantages compared to using Ethereum or any
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain/sidechain on both networks (or others) will be explained below&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the continuation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A Universal Coin Swap system based on bitcoin&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/Ayms/029125db2583e1cf9c3209769eb2cdd7">https://gist.github.com/Ayms/029125db2583e1cf9c3209769eb2cdd7</A> &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> purpose here is to propose a simple Coin Swap decentralized system based
</I>&gt;<i> on Bitcoin but that works for all blockchains/tokens&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to propose something simple, that people can understand,
</I>&gt;<i> secured, decentralized, easy to implement/use, not expensive for the
</I>&gt;<i> users, unlike Ethereum solutions, showing also that bitcoin can easily
</I>&gt;<i> do in a much more simple manner what ethereum is doing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a bit similar to Lightning but not as sophisticated, basically the
</I>&gt;<i> proof of deals are stored in OP_RETURN (looks trivial, yes, but unlike
</I>&gt;<i> other solutions the proposals store a real proof and does not flood the
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoin network with funny stuff, it could be turned into bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> contracts which most likely will not be recognized as standard), we
</I>&gt;<i> cannot enforce everything like Lightning but the trust here is more
</I>&gt;<i> based on a reputation model, and same as Lightning the cheater just lose
</I>&gt;<i> its bitcoin or get tagged as a cheater, will be tracked and might assume
</I>&gt;<i> the consequences later
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As written, I am a fan of Lightning but see it more as a middle/long
</I>&gt;<i> term relationship between people since coins must be locked into a
</I>&gt;<i> multisig transaction while here we are more talking about a one time
</I>&gt;<i> deal, where you don't know if you will buy something else to the seller,
</I>&gt;<i> with which coin and where (metaverse for example)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For your review and comments, here or in private, no real inventions
</I>&gt;<i> here but some non usual ideas like the double hash, the third party and
</I>&gt;<i> others, solving also one of my personal problematic since years: &quot;how to
</I>&gt;<i> sell a secret NFT?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case it remains decentralized (but of course some tools/wallets
</I>&gt;<i> must ease the process for the users), like Lightning, and unlike
</I>&gt;<i> everything that is existing today in those areas to my knowledge, except
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning again
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aymeric
</I>&gt;<i>
