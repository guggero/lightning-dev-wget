Assuming the overall process is:

 * Alice sends a payment to Bob, who has provided a reusable address
   AddrBob
 * Bob is offline at the time the payment is sent, but his semi-trusted
   LSP Larry is online
 * Alice is willing/able to do bidirectional communication with Larry
 * The payment does not complete until Bob is online (at which point
   Alice may be offline)

I think in this case you want to aim for the receipt to be a BIP340
signature of the message &quot;Alice has paid me $50 -- signed Bob&quot;.

Given Bob's public signature nonce, R, Alice (and Larry) can calculate
S = R + H(R,P,m)*P (m is the receipt message, P is Bob's public key),
and then Alice can send a PTLC conditional on revealing the log of S, ie
s where s*G=S; and at that point (s, R) is a valid signature by Bob of a
message confirming payment to Bob, which then serves as the final receipt.

However for this to work, Alice needs to discover &quot;R&quot; while Bob is
offline. I think this is only doable if Bob pre-generates a set of
nonces and shares the public part with Larry, who can then share them
with potential payers.  I think to avoid attacks via Wagner's algorithm,
you probably need to do a similar setup as musig2 does, ie share (R1,R2)
pairs, and calculate R = H(P,R1,R2,m)*R1+R2.

So a setup like:

  Alice gets AddrBob. Decodes Bob's pubkey, Larry's pubkey, and the
  route to Larry.

  Alice -&gt; Larry: &quot;Hi, I want to send Bob $50, and get a receipt&quot;
  Larry -&gt; Alice: &quot;The nonce for that will be R&quot;
  Alice: calculates m = &quot;Hash(&quot;Alice paid Bob $50&quot;), S = R+H(R,P,m)*P
  Alice -&gt; Larry(for Bob): PTLC[$50, S]

  Larry -&gt; Bob: PTLC[$50, S]
                Alice wants to pay you $50, using nonce pair #12345
  Bob: verifies nonce #12345 has not been previously used, calculates R,
       calculates m, calculates s, and checks that s*G = S, checks
       there's a $50 PTLC conditional on S waiting for confirmation.
  Bob -&gt; Alice: claims $50 from PTLC by revealing s

  Alice: receives s; (R,s) serves as Bob's signature confirming payment

seems plausible?

Every &quot;S&quot; here commits to a value chosen by the sender (ie, their
&quot;identity&quot;), so there's no way for Larry to get two different payers
to use the same S. Using the same nonce twice will just mean Bob has to
reject the payment (and find a new LSP).

It may make sense to require Alice to make a micropayment to Larry in
order to claim a nonce. You'd want a standard template for &quot;m&quot; so that
it's easy to generate and parse consistently, of course.

I think you could even have separate LSPs if you wanted: one to issue
nonces while you're offline, and the other to actually hold onto incoming
PTLCs while you're offline.

FWIW, some previous discussion, which didn't focus on offline recipients:
