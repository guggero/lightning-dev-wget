<PRE>Good morning x-raid,

&gt;<i> so You propose Acinq / Blockstream / Lightning Labs do not have funds to run a box or 2 ?
</I>
Not at all, I am proposing that these people, who have already done the effort to release working Lightning Network Node implementations free of charge to you, are not obligated to *also* devote more hardware and resources.

Let me tell a little story...

Some years ago, during the SegWit wars, there was a sentiment &quot;when are **they** going to implement Lightning??&quot;
Both anti-SegWit and pro-SegWit asked this:

* anti-SegWit: Yeah, you need bigblocks, Lightning is vaporware, when are **they** going to implement Lightning?
* pro-SegWit: Lightning is so totes kool, this is why we SegWit, when are **they** going to implement Lightning?

After some time participating in the SegWit wars, I realized that I was, in fact, a programmer (LOL).
So why should **I** be asking when **they** are going to implement Lightning?
As a programmer, **I** could implement Lightning myself!
I should be asking myself why **I** was not implementing it.

Thus I started contributing to the Lightning implementation written in a language I could understand, C-Lightning.


My question to you is: obviously you are a node operator as otherwise the issue you raise would not be relevant to you, but what can *you* do to advance your goal?

(In any case: C-Lightning and Eclair devs have already mentioned they already run mainnet nodes tracking our respective master branches (i.e. we already eat our own dog food, because duh --- for many of us, the reason we are developing this is because for *other* reasons, we *have to* run Lightning nodes), is there any particular implementation you are concerned about?
Maybe ask them directly?)


Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
