<PRE>One direction that I explored is to start with a statement by the user in
this form:

&quot;If there is a route with a success probability of 50%, then I am willing
to pay up to 1.8x the routing fee for an alternative route that has a 80%
success probability&quot;

I like this because it isn't an abstract weight or factor. It is actually
clear what this means.

What I didn't yet succeed in is to find a model where I can plug in 50%,
80% and 1.8x and generalizes it to arbitrary inputs A% and B%. But it seems
to me that there must be some probabilistic equation / law / rule / theorem
/ ... that can support this.

Joost.

&gt;<i> In Lightning pathfinding the two main variables to optimize for are
</I>&gt;<i> routing fee and reliability. Routing fee is concrete. It is the sat amount
</I>&gt;<i> that is paid when a payment succeeds. Reliability is a property of a route
</I>&gt;<i> that can be expressed as a probability. The probability that a route will
</I>&gt;<i> be successful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During pathfinding, route options are compared against each other. So for
</I>&gt;<i> example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Route A: fee 10 sat, success probability 50%
</I>&gt;<i> Route B: fee 20 sat, success probability 80%
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which one is the better route? That depends on user preference. A patient
</I>&gt;<i> user will probably go for route A in the hope of saving on fees whereas for
</I>&gt;<i> a time-sensitive payment route B looks better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be great to offer this trade-off to the user in a simple way.
</I>&gt;<i> Preferably a single [0, 1] value that controls the selection process. At 0,
</I>&gt;<i> the route is only optimized for fees and probabilities are ignored
</I>&gt;<i> completely. At 1, the route is only optimized for reliability and fees are
</I>&gt;<i> ignored completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But how to choose between the routes A and B for a value somewhere in
</I>&gt;<i> between 0 and 1? For example 0.5 - perfect balance between reliability and
</I>&gt;<i> fee. But what does that mean exactly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone got an idea on how to approach this best? I am looking for a simple
</I>&gt;<i> formula to decide between routes, preferably with a reasonably sound
</I>&gt;<i> probability-theoretical basis (whatever that means).
