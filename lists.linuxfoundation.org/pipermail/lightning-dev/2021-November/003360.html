<PRE>so You propose Acinq / Blockstream / Lightning Labs do not have funds to
run a box or 2 ?

contributions can be made towards each impl by ppl while the project still
do need put liquidity on mainnet to be a viable test before a public
sanctioned release.

I find You choose misread what the text is supposed to convey - those with
the write credentials to repo, when do a public release could have been
tested, before, against the network, and that in no way hinders PR toward
said repo.

&gt;<i> Good morning x-raid,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what i can imagine is each team should provide boxes and channel
</I>&gt;<i> liquidity as stake on mainnet for tests before announce a public realise as
</I>&gt;<i> to feel the pain first hand instead of having several K&#180;s of plebs confused
</I>&gt;<i> and at worst have funds in channelclosed etc. but mostly for helping in
</I>&gt;<i> smooth transitioning into future envisioned mass.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all members of all teams are independently wealthy, and cannot afford
</I>&gt;<i> significant liquidity on mainnet, or can afford good Internet connection
</I>&gt;<i> and keeping a device operational 24/7.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, for some time I was a C-Lightning core developer, yet did not
</I>&gt;<i> run a C-Lightning node myself, relying on sheer code review, because I
</I>&gt;<i> could not afford to run a node.
</I>&gt;<i> What you imagine would raise the barrier towards contribution (i.e. I
</I>&gt;<i> might not have been able to start contributing to C-Lightning in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place, for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you misunderstand the open-source model.
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the skill, but not the money, you can contribute directly.
</I>&gt;<i> If you do not have the skill, but do have the money, you can contribute
</I>&gt;<i> that by hiring developers to work on the project you want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you are using a particular open-source implementation and storing
</I>&gt;<i> your funds with it, either:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * You have the 1337 skillz0rs: you contribute review and actual code.
</I>&gt;<i> * You do not have the 1337 skillz0rs: you contribute hardware and testing
</I>&gt;<i> reports and possibly money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the several Ks of plebs are confused, they can aggregate their
</I>&gt;<i> resources and fund one or two developers to review and contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> project they are using, and maybe some hardware and coins for boxes they
</I>&gt;<i> keep running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At my point of view, the Real Issue (TM) here is how to aggregate the will
</I>&gt;<i> of a group of people, without risking that some centralized &quot;manager&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> resources gets incentives that diverge from the group of people and starts
</I>&gt;<i> allocating resources in ways that the group of people would, in aggregate,
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If teams rather outsource the running of boxes with channels on mainnet
</I>&gt;<i> for impl release and rc versions they would of course be able to, but close
</I>&gt;<i> to home for managing analysis of the team impl themselves is what I would
</I>&gt;<i> recommend.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can also see that each box loglines are collected at one central point
</I>&gt;<i> whereby requests can be made for comparing interoperability per unix.ts
</I>&gt;<i> identified by box.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (thats alot of data You say --not really in Big Data terms, question is
</I>&gt;<i> where to set a proper cap in time for collections ? a week ? a month ?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think i might have a solution for the central point collector that
</I>&gt;<i> could be run by an outside of impl teams perimeter. (sponsored?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See, if the money on the node is my own, and not contributed by the group
</I>&gt;<i> that is going to receive the logs, I am not going to send the logs verbatim
</I>&gt;<i> to them, nope not nada.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not want to become a target, because logs leak information like who
</I>&gt;<i> my channel counterparties are and how often I forward HTLCs and exact dates
</I>&gt;<i> and times of each event, and thus can be used to locate my node, and
</I>&gt;<i> location is the first step to targeted attack.
</I>&gt;<i> I mean I use a frikkin set of 8 random letters, come on.
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly if the logs had sensitive information redacted (even dates and
</I>&gt;<i> times??), but we need to automate that redaction, and in particular, if the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation changes log messages, we need to ensure that changed log
</I>&gt;<i> messages do not leak information that gets past the automated redaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
