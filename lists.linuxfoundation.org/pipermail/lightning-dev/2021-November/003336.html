<PRE>Hi y'all,

A few weeks ago over a dozen Lightning developers met up in Zurich for two
days to discuss a number of matters related to the current state and
evolution of the protocol. All major implementations were represented to
some degree, and we even had a number of &quot;independent&quot;
developers/researchers join (in person or via a video call) as well.

What follows is my best attempt at summarizing (and inserting any relevant
details I forgot to write down, along with a bit of commentary) the set of
notes I took during the sessions.  I'm no Kanzure, so I wasn't able to fully
capture all the relevant conversations/topics, so what follows is my best
attempt at cataloguing the most relevant conversations. If you attended and
felt I missed out on a key point, or inadvertently misrepresented a
statement/idea, please feel free to reply correcting or adding additional
detail.

The meeting notes in full can be found here:

# Taproot x PTLC x LN

One of the first larger sessions that kicked off was dedicated to discussing
various paths/proposals to upgrading the entire network to taproot based
channels and upgrading the current hash based e2e payment mechanisms (HTLCs)
to instead be based on EC keys (PTLC utilizing adapter sigs, etc). Taproot
is desirable as it allows most operations (funding, co-op close, certain
sweep types, etc) to blend in with normal transactions (once uptake is high
enough). The addition of schnorr sigs into the protocol alongside taproot
significantly expands the design space of off-chain protocols as it allows
the deployment of certain types of scriptless script based adapter
signatures. Namely, the PTLC concept that does away with the current
hash-baed HTLCs, and gives us better privacy + compostability.

## Big Bang vs Iterative Deployment

Recently aj published [4] a proposal for a taproot upgrade that incorporates
several ideas into a single package, with the goal of doing a single large
update to upgrade the network in one swoop. The proposal includes: an
upgrade to taproot, revising all the scripts we used to be more taprooty and
scriptless scripty, a base new revocation mechanism for punishment based
channels, an instantiation of PTLCs, a new commitment state update machine
(as it uses symmetric state like eltoo), a new layer commitment structure
meant to alleviate a trade-off of symmetric state/eltoo related to CLTV+CSV
dependencies and ultimately, eltoo itself as well.

A core matter discussed was if we should try to do things in a sort of &quot;big
bang&quot; manner (get everything all at once), or try to roll things out more
iteratively.

Pros for the big bang roll out is that we get things all at once, and
wouldn't need to &quot;throw away&quot; any intermediate steps as future ones are
rolled out. Cons are that it would be, well, a rather big update to the
entire network, and the core code of all implementations. This would
potentially be difficult to get right all at once, could take a ton of time
to properly review the entire protocol, implement, and finally deploy.

An alternative considered was a more iterative approach. Pros for the
iterative approach would that we'd be able to get some easy wins early on
(mu-sig based funding outputs as an example) for elements with a smaller
design space. We'd also be able to review the components one at at time,
while making further background progress on the more amorphous aspects of a
greater proposal. Cons of the iterative approach is that it would
_potentially_ take longer than a big bang approach (from start to &quot;finish&quot;,
finish being everything we ever wanted). We'd also potentially need to
&quot;abandon&quot; components as newer ones are proposed to take their place,
possibly creating technical/code debt. A system for dynamically updating the
channel params/format would make this process more streamlined, as with the
new channel_type funding feature, we'd be able to incrementally upgrade a
channel (to a degree).

### An Potential Iterative Roadmap

The question of what an iterative roadmap would even look like was brought
up. A lofty proposal was the following ordering (not binding at all fwiw),
note that some of these items can be carried out concurrently:

  1. Mu-Sig

    * The root component everything else relies on. We'd first all implement
      Mu-Sig 2 (more on that below) and port the current 2-of-2 multi-sig
      output instead a aggregate key schnorr 2-of-2 output. Along the way
      we'd do a naive port of the current script set into the tapscript
      tree. This would mean just porting the scripts as is, with minimal
      modifications. The main thing we'd need to do is port over all the CMS
      instances to use CSA (check sig add) instead).

      Note that we'd also likely need to change/modify the current
      sig/revocation dance to account for proper exchange of nonces, partial
      signatures, etc. Much of this still needs to be concretely designed.

  2. Native port of scripts into tapscript

    * Next we'd optimize the current set of scripts, rolling them into new
      tapscript branches as necessary. We'd likely also take a look at
      miniscript to see how things can be further organized once re-ordered.

  3. PTLCS

    * In this phase we'd start to roll out PTLCs by adding a new node level
      feature bit, re-working the onion payload, and also the HTLC scripts
      (and also state machine in the process?). PTLCs only work if the
      entire path supports it, so it may take some time to get near 100%
      upgrade of the internal routing network.

  4. New scriptless script revocation mechanisms

    *  Next we'd start to incorporate the new scriptss script based
       revocation mechanism. At a high level, it does away with the explicit
       revocation secret reveal and instead bundles it into the normal
       multi-sig commitment sig transfer using adapter signatures to reveal
       the revocation secret. See the original proposal, or this paper [1]
       for further details.

       Note that this step is somewhat optional, as it moves entirely to
       symmetric state which is nice w.r.t aligning things with the eventual
       eltoo roll out, but also would require a more significant re-working
       of the state machine and on-chain handling.

  5. Layer commitments

    * Related to symmetric commitment state and eltoo, this proposes to
modify
      the initial &quot;update&quot; transaction to decouple the CLTV+CSV timeouts on
      HTLCs in a similar manner to our current second-level HTLCs. This is
      an attempt to mitigate one of the tradeoffs brought about by symmetric
      state and eltoo.

      Similar to the new revocation mechanism, this is somewhat an optional
      step as well. The main benefit here is that it would further converge
      the paths of revocation vs sequence (eltoo) based channels. Assuming
      revocation channels are still widely in use, they wouldn't necessarily
      need to adopt this new format at all.

  7. Eltoo

    * Sequence based channels, combines a lot of the above, removes the
      revocation mechanism from channels, opens things up to multi-party
      channel design, etc. Last in the sequence as it requires some form of
      soft-fork update on the base chain.

## Mu-Sig 2

As a potential first candidate in the iterative taproot roll out process,
there was a lot of discussion around where Mu-Sig 2 was: if the libraries
are ready, if people have already started implementing it, any open design
questions, etc. From the discussions, the general conclusion was (note that
there was other discussion with developers actively working on the design
later in the week) that there still needs to be some standardization work
around Mu-Sig 2 itself, particularly w.r.t guidance on safe deterministic
nonce generation.

For consumers of `secp256k1-zkp`, a PR implementing MuSig2 from an API
perspective is under active review [2]. From here, it appears the next steps
would be attempting to create a BIP around some of the message passing,
nonce generation, and cicatrization aspects of the protocol when deployed to
a two/multi party setting.

As the inclusion of MuSig2 would end up modifying the core state machine
(particularly how new signatures are exchange), some lofty design sketches
like piggybacking extra nonces onto the current revoke_and_ack message were
tossed around, with nothing too concrete being developed during the
conversations.

### Mu-Sig 2 &amp; Gossip

Today we end up sending 4 signatures whenever we announce a new channel
announcement on the network (2 sigs of the multi-sig keys, and 2 sigs of the
node keys), using Mu-Sig 2 here in place would allow us to reduce this to a
single signature which makes things slightly more efficient and also saves
some space. Given how independent this change was from the core
channel/funding changes (can be done today with the existing OG segwit
channels), people generally thought this would be a good place to start, as
it's relatively low risk and help people vet their implementations and
become more comfortable with the new primitives at our disposal.

## PTLCs &amp; The Onion

Aside from the core channel level changes, PTLCs are another key development
brought about by the activation of taproot. The Surebits team and their
collaborators have done a ton of work in this area proving out their concept
for their application within the DLC realm. General anointment was that we
should be able to build on their work/exploration in designing the
final version for LN itself.

One thing that needs to be modified is the set of payloads included in the
onion itself. This doesn't seem to be too big of a lift (nonce and points
for the left+right locks, etc), but may end up shrinking the max possible
route length a bit, as more space in the onion for a given hop takes away
from the space that can be allocated to later hops. Some ideas were tossed
around that may help us _save_ some space by re-using the shared secret
derived for each hop (still needs to be fleshed out some).

# Sync (or slightly more sync?) vs Async Commitment Update State Machines

One topic that came up a few times was the trade-offs brought about by
moving to a _more_ synchronous channel update state machine vs the current
async (and potentially fully non-blocking) state machine. When we say sync,
we typically mean something that ends up with one or both sides taking turns
to do updates. This is much simpler than the current fully async update
state machine, and appears to be somewhat of a requirement when moving to
symmetric channel state (like eltoo does).

An active proposal to the spec attempts to introduce a 'sftu' message to
sort of pause things and clear the air for potentially difficult to
implement in an async environment enhancements like splicing. Related to
that
is another active proposal that attempts to make the current state machine
more sync by adding alternating rounds, which ends up simplifying things
quite a bit.

Re trade-offs there was discussion w.r.t if one or the other offered
theoretical higher transaction rates vs the other. In the end the rough
conclusion was that both likely end up about the same w.r.t throughput, but
an async state machine would win over when it comes to latency (as it's more
non-blocking, particularly when you allow multiple unrevoked commitments by
sending more than 1 revocation key at the very start).

# Meta Spec Process Topics

Not _that_ &quot;Meta&quot; ;) -- but general discussions around the current process,
progress, and priorities of the current spec work.

## IRC vs Video Chats for Spec Meetings

A big topic was the current velocity of active proposals, review
bandwidth/energy, and just general momentum of the current spec process. A
few attendees felt like the move to mostly IRC meetings slowed things down a
bit, as while it's nice that everything is written down and open access,
discussions tend to drag along, and it's easy to misinterpret a message or
miss one during cross chatter. The idea to bring back the video calls was
brought up, as many conversations can be hashed out more easily over voice
vs scattered IRC messages over a 1 hr period. The latest spec meeting had an
optional video chat that a few people ended up joining. Some ppl have mixed
feelings about going back to the calls vs IRC as we lose the transcript, but
seems the important thing is that the major action items, decisions, and
follow up are written down.

# BOLTs, bLIPs, and BOLT Proposals

As the years have gone on, and the protocol has evolved it's clear that
there's just _so much_ stuff to be designed, worked on, and deployed. The
BOLT system has served us well through the years, but also fallen short at
times when it comes to evolution of the text itself. People seemed to agree
that a rough heuristic of what should be in a BOLT is what &quot;everyone needs
to agree on&quot;, so core network capabilities like PLTCs. For everything else
there're bLIP^TM (which are still in the process of getting off the ground,
which are more descriptive documents that may describe some cool new feature
deployed on the edges of the network like custom backup schemes, or async
payment architectures (like Breez's Lightning Rod).

On the topic of BOLT evolution, some expressed that the way things have
evolved it can be hard to reason about what came first, or why certain
things are the way they were. A response to this (that has somewhat started
to catch on), is having a standalone proposals [8] folder that works through
the rationale and design space, to be committed alongside a minimal set of
changes to the core BOLT document.

Related to BOLT evolution was the question of: when should a new standalone
document (like BOLT-12/Offers) be created vs extending an existing document?
The original idea was to have a logical layering between the numbers to
create clean separation, but over time this principle wasn't fully adhered
to/communicated, with some documents being more self contained than others.
In the past we also attempts to create clear delineations by tagging a
&quot;Lighting 1.1&quot; version, but that never really happened.

Some suggested that we move to a sort of IETF approach, where we have
multiple versioned documents that end up copying everything from the prior
version, with the new additions (like bgp1, bgp2, etc). This ends up with
some copy/past duplication, but allows implementers to just read a single
document from top to bottom and not have to worry about old conditional
logic that has been mostly phased out at this point.

Related to the question of review bandwidth was a topic (tbh not sure I
fully captured this correctly in the notes) of &quot;silent dissent&quot; where by not
reviewing something it's assumed a contributor doesn't fully support a
proposal/extension. Some felt this wasn't desirable as it ends up blocking
proposals, while others were ok with it as they felt if another
implementation wasn't ready to pick it up and review it, then maybe it
wasn't quite yet a BOLT ready extension and needed more review. The
evolution of onion messages was cited as an example where something sat for
a while, but then was reviewed by another implementation and ended up being
improved with lots of good feedback. I don't remember if there was really
any sort of conclusion here, but some suggested adopting bitcoind's system
of high priori reviews, which may help, but then again the solution space of
LN is just so large and multiple things can be worked on independently.

The session concluded with a call to zoom out a bit, and attempt to tease
out where we want the spec to be in 5 years or so, then move towards that
incrementally as a group.

# Onion Messages &amp; Offers

There was a session on onion messages and the related Offers proposal [5]
where the proposer was able to really dig into a lot of specifics, answer
questions on the scope, and tease out a possible staged deployment plan. The
main motivation of the design of Offers was to both move us away from the
awkward bech32 encoding (though it still uses it in certain places?) and
also not necessarily require a receiver to be running a web server to be
able to negotiate the payment. The new invoice format inherits most of the
fields from BOLT 11, but also adds a pairing key that can be used for
refunds (you prove you know the key, it's embedded in the custom invoice
created for your), and also be used to create _unique_ proofs of payment.

In terms of possible a possible deployment path, there was talk of possible
leaving out certain features like recurrence, fiat exchange (?), stateless
invoices, extra metadata, streaming invoices (allows to not have to fetch a
new one each time, but I didn't fully follow the scheme), and just implement
the base invoice format w/ the optional interactive invoice creation.
Bridging BOLT 11 and 12 is possible in theory as well, though the custom
BOLT 12 stuff would need to be left over or like stuffed into some metadata
field in BOLT 11.

Questions of the adoption window were brought up, since some of the
functionality BOLT 12 offers (namely the payment negotiation features) are
already implemented and deployed in higher-level protocols like LN-URL (and
its extensions). So new developers/services need to be won over and
convinced to adopt the new system, given they already have alternatives
deployed that worked mostly _outside_ the protocol to achieve the
functionality. Some found the lack of tight integration to the web layer as
a plus (for BOLT 12), but others weren't really sure it was a big deal given
most services these days are already web based. There was also brief
discussion of BOLT12address [9], which emulates some of the LN Address
functionality, but handles certs in a slightly different manner (?).

# Boomerang, &quot;Stuckless&quot; Payments, and Payment Level ACKs

Related to the PTLC conversation is if we want to (from the start)
incorporate some of the techniques that allows safe payment retry on the
network layer by enforcing a sort of 2-phase settlement protocol where the
sender doesn't allow redundant/repeated payments to be fulfilled. The
original Boomerang [6] scheme was based on a VSS (verifiable secret sharing
protocol) to enforce a penalty if the remote party fulls too many shards.
Stuckless [7] in comparison adds another round of iteration and ends up
being slightly simpler.

At a higher level, there was discussion of if this sort of over/repeated
payment scenario really happens all that often in practice, but no one
seemed to have a good answer. One under explored benefit of the scheme
discussed was that it actually allows you to safely send out current HTLCs
during path finding, since you're confident that overpayment isn't possible.
AMP was also discussed as an alternative way to achieve the same thing,
though
via that atomicity enforced by the secret sharing scheme.

A related topic was the concept of a payment level ACK, which would give the
sender valuable feedback of when the HTLC _actually_ arrived at the other
end. Today senders only know about failures, or when things ultimately all
arrive (settle). Being able to know an HTLC arrived is very valuable
information, as it lets one update their path finding or flow analysis in
real time based on information from the receiver.

One way to achieve this (sorta hacky) would be to send a &quot;tracer&quot; HTLC
that should be cancelled back once the actual HTLC arrives. However this
runs into issue of the tracer getting stuck, etc (need to ACK the ACK to
ACK the ACK). A better way would be to utilize onion messages (or a sort of
soft error, needs to be written) to allow communication between sender and
receiver. It also may be the case that stuckless also naturally gives us
ACKs at this level as well.

# Channel Jamming

Another topic that evolved into its own track/session was the topic of
channel jamming and generally DoS mitigation techniques related to channels.
Several categories of mitigations were disused including: prepaying for
everything, forwarding passes (similar to Bittorrent like reputation),
staking certificates, forwarding level up/down stream reputation, per-node
VDF based global rate limiting, PoW, viewing the existing HTLC costs as a
bond, and also extending the current fee equation to also factor in the
worst-case CLTV delay of an HTLC.

Pre/post pay techniques have been discussed extensively on the mailing list,
so I won't go into those and will instead focus on some of the newer
idea/concepts discussed. Open questions here are mainly surrounding proper
parametrization (how much should it cost?) and further analysis w.r.t if a
de minims fee will actually serve to discourage well funded attackers, given
it's a griefing vector so nothing is gained directly either way.

## Forwarding Passes

The concept of a &quot;forwarding&quot; pass was introduced/discussed, which
effectively is a per-node sort of rep currency created using symmetric
crypto (think of it as a symmetrically encrypted metadata blob). In order
to route through a node, one needs to first obtain a freebie pass which is
passed back via the onion, which requires an initial failed payment or some
sort of LSP bootstrapping mechanism. From there any successfully forwarded
payments that include that forwarding pass (possibly to be re-randomized?)
would accrue additional attributes/weight/reputation. Essentially you buy
your way into the routing graces of a node with successful forwards over
time and good behavior.

The general idea is rather than (attempt) to punish individuals, one should
attempt to ensure that the network is able to gracefully fallback to a sort
of reduced operating mode is spam is rampant. As this is a per-node system
(local), if a node is under high load, they can choose to only observe
passes that are older than 3 weeks, or only those that have generated a
certain amount of routings fees, etc. There would exist no global policy,
but instead a local policy that nodes would use to restrict the set of
permissible traffic sources.

The downsides of this approach is that a forwarding node is able to
correlate senders to a degree (since the pass it tied to the origin, but
doesn't give away information like pub keys, it's a new pseudonymous
identifier). Others also cited the similarity to the existing Bittorrent
reputation system and the difficult of ensuring that a party isn't able to
continually obtain &quot;freebie&quot; passes/reputation, thereby by passing the
entire thing.

## Existing HTLC Costs as a Bond

Another newer concept discussed/generated/re-oriented during the discussion
was viewing the existing HTLC cost as a bond. At times sending HTLCs is
viewed as being &quot;costless&quot;on the network, but sending an HTLC has a direct
cost: the time value of the coins committed in the HTLC. In the worst case,
the sender needs to be ready to wait for the absolute CLTV timeout (which is
highest at the sender) to expire before they can claim their funds. When
combined with generally higher values for the min_htlc routing policy,
routing nodes are able to dictate the minimum bond cost to a sender to
transit their node.

This line of thinking asserts that there already _is_ a cost (both the
HTLC(s) and the cost to fund and maintain a channel), to attempting to spam
HTLCs, which seems to have played some role in mitigations (but also that
there's no true gain, it's griefing). Extending this concept, it's then
possible for a node to retroactively raise its minimum bond size (either via
min_htlc or applied during forwarding) when its set of commitment slots
becomes too saturated. This model would then divide up the available
commitment space into different QoS buckets with varying amounts for the
smallest HTLC allowed in that slot.

Questions of if dust would be factored in were brought up, and also to start
to increase the 483 value as it makes attacks easier and can be raised
higher to the policy level limit, as the current setting optimizes for an
uncommon case (breach with a fully loaded commitment transaction) at the
cost of throughput and making it easier to fully load a commitment
transaction.

## Pricing the HTLC Option Cost using Theta

Another concept discussed was the fact that today, routing fees don't
accurately reflect the apparent time value: I pay the same fee for
using a 1000 block CLTV as I do for a 20 block CLTV. Many viewed this as an
incentive issue as if corrected, then longer routes (more CLTV deltas) would
be more expensive, which would make certain classes of attacks more
expensive as well. In addition it would require services that can end up
holding HTLCs for a long period of time to pay up front (again increase the
&quot;bond value&quot; as mentioned above) for this duration.

In terms of a potential roll out, something like this could be naively
phased in by extending the current fee algorithm we a new scaling term,
dubbed theta:

  * fee = amt*feeRate + baseFee + (amt*cltvAbsolute*theta)

Note that if `theta` is zero, then it's the same as the current algorithm.
Increasing it to one causes fees to scale linearly with the product of the
amount and worst case (absolute) time delay. Rather than a simple
multiplicative increase, perhaps some polynomial should be used as a scaling
factor here to give node operators more flexibility. By setting certain
coefficients to zero, they'd be able to opt out of more aggressive scaling
if they wished.

With the way gossip and path finding works today, nodes that want to adopt
this scheme could begin to do so by adding a new TLV value that includes the
theta field possibly with a required (?) feature bit to indicate senders
_must_ understand theta.

An alternative way to phase it in brought up was just to repurpose the
baseFee (as some advocates think it should be removed/ignored) to instead be
interpreted as this `theta` value.

Related to this topic are also the channel variants that achieve a &quot;constant
time delay&quot; with their HTLC mechanism, which allows all participants to have
the same time delay and avoid having to increment the worst case delay as
new routes are added to the hops.

## Packet Switching

One of the last group sessions was on the topic of introducing new packet
switching operating modes into the network. Compared to the current source
routing based method (where the sender selects the entire route), with
packet switching they'd either specify only a destination (possibly using a
blinded route, more on that below), or select a series of &quot;waypoints&quot; with
the intermediate nodes having freedom to select the route as they choose (a
la certain flavors of trampoline).

### Open Questions w.r.t Trampoline Deployment

The session kicked up by exploring some of the unanswered questions w.r.t a
wider production deployment of the trampoline scheme (so far there're only
two (?) trampoline nodes on the network: the main ACINQ mainnet node
Horizon, and the main Electrum node). One question posited was: do
trampoline nodes retry _internally_ within the network, or simply fail back
after the first failed routing attempt? Internal network retry has the
benefit that in theory a trampoline node has a much better grasp on the
liquidity distribution within their local network than the sender. However,
assuming a path has several trampoline nodes within a route, the internal
retry and _each_ of them has the potential to add considerable latency to a
payment, and also rob the sender of any information they can use to update
their path/attempt (as they aren't able to receive onion errors from the
final destination as normal).

### Trampoline Incentives &amp; Sender Implications

Other open question included: how a sender was to properly set the fee and
time lock budget (and how that affected the effort nodes would take on to
optimize their fees gain), and how nodes were to be discovered in the first
place (for clients that only opted to insert the trampoline nodes into their
local graph). As the graph gets larger, some felt that the existence of
trampoline nodes actually encourages routing nodes to maintain the graph as
otherwise, it actually isn't needed for routine forwarding.

### Privacy Implications of Trampoline Nodes

Another big topic of discussion was the ultimate privacy benefits of
inserting one or many trampoline nodes into the route. An argument was
presented that that argued that anything but adding trampoline nodes at the
start/end would end up degrading privacy, as the intermediate nodes learn
that any nodes that accept the HTLC from them to the next trampoline node
could be ruled out as the destination, thereby reducing the anonymity set
and set of possible/available paths (due to loop attack prevention some
implementations like lnd use [3]). Assuming the argument holds, then its
appears desirable to only use the following configurations (more analysis
needed ofc):

  * Single trampoline node at the start: essentially offers delegated path
    finding. Wallets like Phoenix use this operating mode today.

  * Single trampoline node at the end: gives us the long sought after
    rendezvous payments, which enhance the current protocol by offering
    _receiver_ anonymity in addition to the current sender anonymity.

  * Two trampoline nodes, one at the start and one at the end: combines the
    above operating modes, giving best of both worlds (or just route
    blinding for the final leg to support payments to unadvertised
    channels?), while minimizing the anonymity set link as each additional
    trampoline hop can gain more information w.r.t the prior route up to
    that point.

Generally more investigation is needed here to understand the privacy
implications of moving to a hybrid onion/packet-switched model. In the end
though the fundamental trade-off of privacy vs scalability appears to still
be a factor.
