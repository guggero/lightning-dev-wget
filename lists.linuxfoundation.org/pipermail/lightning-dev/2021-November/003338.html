<PRE>Oh, also there's currently this sort of placeholder logo from waaay back
that's used as the org's avatar/image. Perhaps it's time we roll an
&quot;official&quot; logo/avatar? Otherwise we can just switch over the randomly
generated blocks thingy that Github uses when an account/org has no
avatar.

</I>&gt;<i>     admins.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * A new blips repo (<A HREF="https://github.com/lightning/blips">https://github.com/lightning/blips</A>) has been

</I>&gt;<i>     continue the PR that was originally started in the lightning-rfc
</I>&gt;<i> repo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * The old lightning-rfc repo has been moved over, and been renamed to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bolts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     (<A HREF="https://github.com/lightning/bolts">https://github.com/lightning/bolts</A> -- should it be all caps? )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to all that participated in the discussion (particularly in
</I>&gt;<i> meatspace
</I>&gt;<i> during the recent protocol dev meetup!), happy we were able to resolve
</I>&gt;<i> things
</I>&gt;<i> and begin the next chapter in the evolution of the Lightning protocol!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Also note that lnd has _never_ referred to itself as the &quot;reference&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; implementation.  A few years ago some other implementations adopted that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; title themselves, but have since adopted softer language.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't remember that but if you're referring to c-lightning it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first lightning implementation, and the only one for a while, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a way it was a &quot;reference&quot; at the time ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or it could have been a reference to their policy of &quot;implementing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec, all the spec and nothing but the spec&quot;  ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think it's worth briefly revisiting a bit of history here w.r.t the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> github
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; org in question. In the beginning, the lightningnetwork github org was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; created by Joseph, and the lightningnetwork/paper repo was added, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; manuscript that kicked off this entire thing. Later
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightningnetwork/lnd was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; created where we started to work on an initial implementation (before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; BOLTs in their current form existed), and we were added as owners.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually we (devs of current impls) all met up in Milan and decided to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; converge on a single specification, thus we added the BOLTs to the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; repo, despite it being used for lnd and knowingly so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, work on c-lightning then eclair then lnd all began a long time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before the BOLTs process was implemented, and we all set up repos,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accounts...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that we all inherited things  from the &quot;pre-BOLTS&quot; era and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing them will create some friction but I still believe it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be done. You also mentioned potential admin rights issues on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current specs repos which would be solved by moving them to a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clean repo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As it seems the primary grievance here is collocating an implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Lightning along with the _specification_ of the protocol, and given
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; spec was added last, how about we move the spec to an independent repo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; by the community? I currently have github.com/lightning, and would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to donate it to the community, or we could create a new org like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;lightning-specs&quot; or something similar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds great! github.com/lightning is nice (and I like Damian's idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of using github.com/lightning/bolts) and seems to please everyone so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it looks that we have a plan!
