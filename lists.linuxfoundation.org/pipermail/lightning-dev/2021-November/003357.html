<PRE>what i can imagine is each team should provide boxes and channel liquidity
as stake on mainnet for tests before announce a public realise as to feel
the pain first hand instead of having several K&#180;s of plebs confused and at
worst have funds in channelclosed etc. but mostly for helping in smooth
transitioning into future envisioned mass.

If teams rather outsource the running of boxes with channels on mainnet for
impl release and rc versions they would of course be able to, but close to
home for managing analysis of the team impl themselves is what I would
recommend.

Can also see that each box loglines are collected at one central point
whereby requests can be made for comparing interoperability per unix.ts
identified by box.
(thats alot of data You say --not really in Big Data terms, question is
where to set a proper cap in time for collections ? a week ? a month ?)
I think i might have a solution for the central point collector that could
be run by an outside of impl teams perimeter. (sponsored?)
