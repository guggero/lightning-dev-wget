<PRE>We are talkin interoperability among impl not individual node operators
version management of chosen impl.

where Pierre of Acinq says
&quot;So we eat our own dog food and will experience force closes before our
users do..&quot;
hahaha made my day ...

a node operator do tests live in its continuous integration efforts would
be expected and should be able do so with a by impl assured latest stable
release version.

what is suggested for dialog is the different impl maintainers before sign
off a stable release do a extra test live on mainnet with liquidity in
channels towards the other impl versions and by doing so can catch
unforseen glitches that tests of impl in isolation can not catch.

what also suggested was a collection point where one could fetch loglines
from the instances partaking in the interoperability assurance test.
ex. impl (a) try open channel to impl (b) and fails --can then ask central
logline point for the loglines of ( a &lt; -- &gt; b ) at unix.ts(start) - range
- unix.ts(end).

this then would help assert a new release of a impl is interoperable and
can be recommende for install as considered be latest stable release
version.

LN a Network System Class &quot;Finacial&quot; need in preparation for onboarding 1B
by 2026 start to grow up *now*.

thanks

&gt;<i> Good morning x-raid,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so You propose Acinq / Blockstream / Lightning Labs do not have funds to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all, I am proposing that these people, who have already done the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me tell a little story...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some years ago, during the SegWit wars, there was a sentiment &quot;when are
</I>&gt;<i> **they** going to implement Lightning??&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Both anti-SegWit and pro-SegWit asked this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * anti-SegWit: Yeah, you need bigblocks, Lightning is vaporware, when are
</I>&gt;<i> **they** going to implement Lightning?
</I>&gt;<i> * pro-SegWit: Lightning is so totes kool, this is why we SegWit, when are
</I>&gt;<i> **they** going to implement Lightning?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After some time participating in the SegWit wars, I realized that I was,
</I>&gt;<i> in fact, a programmer (LOL).
</I>&gt;<i> So why should **I** be asking when **they** are going to implement
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning?
</I>&gt;<i> As a programmer, **I** could implement Lightning myself!
</I>&gt;<i> I should be asking myself why **I** was not implementing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus I started contributing to the Lightning implementation written in a
</I>&gt;<i> language I could understand, C-Lightning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question to you is: obviously you are a node operator as otherwise the
</I>&gt;<i> issue you raise would not be relevant to you, but what can *you* do to
</I>&gt;<i> advance your goal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In any case: C-Lightning and Eclair devs have already mentioned they
</I>&gt;<i> already run mainnet nodes tracking our respective master branches (i.e. we
</I>&gt;<i> already eat our own dog food, because duh --- for many of us, the reason we
</I>&gt;<i> are developing this is because for *other* reasons, we *have to* run
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning nodes), is there any particular implementation you are concerned
</I>&gt;<i> about?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe ask them directly?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
