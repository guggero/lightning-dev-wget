<PRE>Yep, this is roughly the direction we've gone in LDK - an abstract interface that gives you some 
information about a channel and you return &quot;I'm willing to pay up to X msats to avoid routing over 
that channel as specified&quot;.

It's obviously not perfect in the sense that it won't generate the absolute optimal route given the 
parameters, but it can do pretty well (after some additional fixes we'd like to land) and at least 
optimizes for something the user controls.

Sadly, of course, all of this requires a good model for failure probability, something we don't yet 
have, so we rely on some naive guesses in our default code, and let the user plug in a more advanced 
model if they prefer. Long-term we'll probably add more intelligence, as others (or at least 
c-lightning) have done.

</I>&gt;<i>     In Lightning pathfinding the two main variables to optimize for are routing fee and reliability.
</I>&gt;<i>     Routing fee is concrete. It is the sat amount that is paid when a payment succeeds. Reliability
</I>&gt;<i>     is a property of a route that can be expressed as a probability. The probability that a route
</I>&gt;<i>     will be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     During pathfinding, route options are compared against each other. So for example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Route A: fee 10 sat, success probability 50%
</I>&gt;<i>     Route B: fee 20 sat, success probability 80%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Which one is the better route? That depends on user preference. A patient user will probably go
</I>&gt;<i>     for route A in the hope of saving on fees whereas for a time-sensitive payment route B looks better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     It would be great to offer this trade-off to the user in a simple way. Preferably a single [0,
</I>&gt;<i>     1] value that controls the selection process. At 0, the route is only optimized for fees and
</I>&gt;<i>     probabilities are ignored completely. At 1, the route is only optimized for reliability and fees
</I>&gt;<i>     are ignored completely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     But how to choose between the routes A and B for a value somewhere in between 0 and 1? For
</I>&gt;<i>     example 0.5 - perfect balance between reliability and fee. But what does that mean exactly?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Anyone got an idea on how to approach this best? I am looking for a simple formula to decide
</I>&gt;<i>     between routes, preferably with a reasonably sound probability-theoretical basis (whatever that
</I>&gt;<i>     means).
