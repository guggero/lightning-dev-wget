</I>
Yes, I think you do.  And the other side can CMD_CLOSE during an HTLC
negotiation (for example), so this should be allowed.

I will update it to allow CMD_CLOSE at any time (except when already
closing).

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This makes the constraints clearer, eg. you can't DECLINE_HTLC anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but an ADD_HTLC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#8203;Your states currently allow declining those though:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not at all (or if it does, it's a bug).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;Right, it's a bug as of &#8203;52cda01 then :)
</I>
Weird, my tester should have found that (every tested-for input must be
given).

Ah, yes, it did, once I enhanced the tester to actually track htlcs.
And I've fixed it :)

(Those should be going to STATE_WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_ACCEPT).

&gt;&gt;<i> The simplest (and safest) system is always to error and close when they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break protocol.  There's some game theory involved in whether you should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wait or not, but in the end, they're broken and there's not much you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;Well, you can ignore some errors -- time sync problems might resolve
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, eg. And the &quot;error&quot; might be because of an error on your side
</I>&gt;<i> (your admin ran the wrong date command, there's a bug in your code), that
</I>&gt;<i> might well be fixable. I guess what I'm thinking is that closing a channel
</I>&gt;<i> is a real cost; if they're not actively cheating -- by not completing an
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC update once they agree to it eg -- I'd probably rather it stay open
</I>&gt;<i> (in degraded mode perhaps) than automatically close.
</I>
We could add such things later, but it's really hard to know in advance
what bugs will lose money and which can be ignored.

&gt;&gt;<i> I also wonder if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   A: TIMEDOUT_HTLC -&gt; B: DECLINE (err_time_sync_lost)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; might be useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think it's useful, though if you disagree on time you might get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an error packet.  (What else can you do?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;How is &quot;an error packet&quot; different to a decline packet or a channel close?&#8203;
</I>
It carries an ascii message giving you a clue :)

&gt;<i> Perhaps we should add a current time field to UPDATE_ADD_HTLC so you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defuse clock sync problems earlier?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe time sync is part of the p2p protocol?&#8203; I guess channel
</I>&gt;<i> counterparties are always peers?
</I>
Yes, that makes sense.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#8203;Sorry, I was assuming that one or both implementations were buggy. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to make that explicit.&#8203; You're talking with strangers on the network, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you can't assume their software is bug free, right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That applies to any scheme you come up with, though.  Propose something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simpler, and I'll gladly rewrite.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;I'll have another look when I can see current code :)&#8203;
</I>
NW, just running the now-glacial state tester.  I'm sure there's only 1
bug left!

Cheers,
Rusty.
