&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Finally for (g), I don't think you want to store fees in the routes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, propagating fee updates for (say) 1200 routes isn't too bad,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as long as they're not changing too fast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So forgetting the DHTs, then fee updates take effect via the
</I>&gt;<i> dijkstra-routing-gossip protocol. I don't have any idea how well that
</I>&gt;<i> would perform... If an average channel's fee updates U times per day,
</I>&gt;<i> there are C channels, and N nodes, does that mean a background noise of
</I>&gt;<i> O(log(N)*U*C) fee update traffic or something? (dividing by N to get the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic an individual node sees)
</I>
That sounds about right.  There's a tradeoff between redundancy,
bandwidth and latency.

&gt;<i> It does mean that the &quot;payment info&quot; has to be provided by the payee
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;shortly&quot; before the transaction; otherwise the route and fee information
</I>&gt;<i> would be out of date and the payment becomes &quot;likely&quot; to fail due to
</I>&gt;<i> closed channels or raised fees.
</I>
True.  Though in the case of raised fees you get feedback, and can
adjust.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There are some twisty details here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1) How many beacon nodes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    12, and increase on a log scale with network size.  That size can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    be derived from previous beacons.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think it's also something you could set per-node, like the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; minrelaytxfee.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That doesn't make sense, since we need to agree on who is a beacon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the top 10 beacons and I have the top 14 beacons, we have
</I>&gt;<i> the top 10 beacons in common. During the gossip phase, if either of us
</I>&gt;<i> see someone in the top 10, we pass it along; I pass along a few more as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
If I want to pay you, and you give me those 4 beacons I don't accept, we
break down.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) How long between selection and a beacon becoming active?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    10 blocks.  That gives time for others to connect to beacon node.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Beacons can be &quot;active&quot; as soon as you can route through them, and that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; just a DHT lookup to determine, and then a matter of comparing fees to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what the old beacons give you. So I think no artificial delay is needed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and the real question is just when you expire your routes to/from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; old beacons?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No.  Beacons will get saturated fast unless they have a chance to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prepare.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. I was thinking you have to volunteer to be a beacon, ie something
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1) commit to node id (anchor transaction in blockchain)
</I>&gt;<i>   2) commit to ordering (abs difference of node id versus 
</I>&gt;<i>      sha of latest blockchain block with (depth % 2016 == 0))
</I>&gt;<i>   3) volunteer to be a beacon (sign &quot;imma beacon! depth $n anchor
</I>&gt;<i>      $txid&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>   4) gossip (including your signed volunteer statement) and hope you're
</I>&gt;<i>      in the top 12
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any preparation (opening new channels etc happens between (2) and (3)),
</I>&gt;<i> transactions happen immediately after (4).
</I>
We don't want to have to maintain a table of volunteers, hence 3 &amp; 4 are
merged (simple optimization: delay advertising yourself as a beacon
longer if it's less likely).

Then by convention you delay 10 blocks before using a beacon.  By that
time, routes should be sufficient.

So, it comes down to the following if you want to be a beacon:

1) Use same key anchor tx to sign a message linking your node id to the
   tx.
2) Broadcast that, and signed routes as normal.

&gt;&gt;<i> In particular, the network will want to establish channels
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with new beacons, and beacons may well want to bring offline funds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> online to handle the anticipated capacity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So... doesn't this provide a /really/ juicy target for hackers? Either
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;let's steal funds&quot; variety, or of the &quot;let's find out as much
</I>&gt;<i> info about every transaction as we can&quot; type?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you just have to hack 12 systems to observe/DoS 100% of lightning
</I>&gt;<i> network transactions, that seems worrying to me. I think I'd want to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> being a beacon in that case, just to avoid painting a target on my system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if it's a realistic attack model, but if you can observe:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Bob -&gt; Alice: pay me $20 to R (routes to current beacons: ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and have control of the beacon Alice ends up using, then you can both
</I>&gt;<i> observe that Alice is trying to make the payment (you see an HTLC with
</I>&gt;<i> $20 and R), and prevent Alice from making the payment (you can just not
</I>&gt;<i> forward any transactions involving R).
</I>
Sure.  But if you can observe the private conversation between Bob and
Alice, *and* you control enough nodes that you're likely to be the
beacon they choose, you don't need to be a beacon to block them :)

&gt;<i> Without beacons (but routing still being possible somehow!), Bob could
</I>&gt;<i> anonymously post prices and R values in public; Alice could observe them
</I>&gt;<i> anonymously without giving away that she was observing them, and Mallory
</I>&gt;<i> could not prevent Alice from paying Bob, without controlling Alice or Bob,
</I>&gt;<i> or a large proportion of the lightning network as a whole. Bob could be
</I>&gt;<i> a dissident asking for donations in this scenario, eg.
</I>
Yes!  I've been wondering about this kind of &quot;donation address&quot;
scenario.  Turns out you can encode the R value in the onion routed
message you send, too.  Only the final recipient can read it anyway.

That doesn't help with routing to the donation address; maybe we will
need a best-effort DHT for that?

&gt;<i> ie, nodes do payment forwarding; wallets just spend/recieve. You'd use
</I>&gt;<i> your phone as just a wallet, but you might run a node at home or in
</I>&gt;<i> the cloud. Wallets still do the lightning protocol themselves, they just
</I>&gt;<i> don't earn fees by forwarding payments.
</I>
I think you do want to 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside: &quot;mesh network&quot; seems to be a much better description than
</I>&gt;<i> hub-and-spoke... cf
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lo8mb/serious_question_for_blockstreamcom_will_you_let/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lo8mb/serious_question_for_blockstreamcom_will_you_let/</A>
</I>
Thanks for that: I'd somehow missed that troll.

&gt;&gt;<i> That's a very different architecture,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just using it as terminology (I think...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only architectural implication is that I'm assuming &quot;most&quot; people
</I>&gt;<i> (24999 out of 25000) don't end up doing routing. Given routing nodes
</I>&gt;<i> have to be online with hot keys and thus risk being hacked and having
</I>&gt;<i> their funds drained, I think that's fairly plausible?
</I>
But that risk also describes a wallet.  And if you route, you
potentially gain funds as well as privacy.  It's more a connectivity
issue, I think.

&gt;<i> (Or going the other way; if you're making money running a node, I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's pretty reasonable you'll try to serve on the order of 100k users
</I>&gt;<i> -- much less than that and you'll be under utilising your hardware. But
</I>&gt;<i> with only 8B potential customers, there's a limit on the number of nodes
</I>&gt;<i> that can actually do that, as calculated above. I'm assuming economics
</I>&gt;<i> somehow ends up enforcing that limit effectively)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which uses hosted wallets or something?  I don't think that's very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not hosted wallets; more along the lines of SPV clients, where you're
</I>&gt;<i> relying on the network to do most of the work (in this case working out
</I>&gt;<i> a cheap route, rather than verifying txns)?
</I>
But the &quot;give me a cheap route&quot; question is exactly the same whatever
your role.  It's &quot;give me all your routes to beacons&quot;.  That's a few
hundred routes.  If we're clever it's &quot;give me changes since last time&quot;,
which is easy given that it's finite.

This has the advantage that you can't even tell if I'm routing or not.

Cheers,
Rusty.
