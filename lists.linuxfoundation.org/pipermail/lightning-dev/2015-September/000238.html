That's a great insight!  Fees *do* erode channels.  I had totally missed
that.

&gt;<i> As a beacon, you'll probably be tempted to raise your fees (you're only

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other nodes can fix that by opening up new channels to you, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as b/w goes, the number of beacons and they're bandwidth puts a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   100e6/8 / 2048 = ~6100

</I>
It is.  You definitely want to increase the number of beacons with
network size.

&gt;&gt;<i> Their neighbors will want to buff up, too (they'll take some load off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the beacon if both parties route through them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In the event that someone suggests a route beacon_X -&gt; X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z to
</I>&gt;<i> get to them, and you have a path A -&gt; C -&gt; X -&gt; beacon_X, you can cut out
</I>&gt;<i> the middleman and not route through a beacon at all. I don't think this
</I>&gt;<i> gives much of an improvement though. A beacon could potentially avoid
</I>&gt;<i> this from being possible by partitioning its neighbours into two sets
</I>&gt;<i> and setting incoming fees for one set prohibitively high, and outgoing
</I>&gt;<i> fees to the other set as prohibitively high; managing that dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> would be difficult but I think possible)
</I>
But you'd risk not being used as a beacon if your fees are too high.  It
seems to me that a beacon wants many connections, to avoid the
&quot;short-circuit&quot; case.  At 100 connections, it's only 1%, though
that's the best case which assumes they're all equally likely.

&gt;&gt;<i> A semi-realistic simulation would be interesting.  If payments cluster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by geography and some random channels are established by proximity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (ie. low latency) that may take some of load off the beacons too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think routing by proximity cuts out some of the benefits of onion
</I>&gt;<i> routing; you just end up with locals conncting to their local banks,
</I>&gt;<i> and paying locals directly via their bank, and the bank being able to
</I>&gt;<i> directly correlate payments (or two banks being able to collaborate to
</I>&gt;<i> correlate sender and recipient).
</I>
Good points.  If we reject all routes less than (say) 3 hops by default
it might mean that local payments are *less* efficient.  Oops.

I'll think harder on this...

Cheers,
Rusty.
