Yes, excellent point.  I flip-flopped on that; so I flipped again.

</I>&gt;<i> sometimes drop below 1024 bytes and you'd be able to tell you're near
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the chain.
</I>
Yes and this applies for almost any length selection method.

&gt;<i> Just adding random bytes on to the end should
</I>&gt;<i> work I think - they'll just be treated as extra padding and ignored.
</I>
My original plan.  But it enables a probing attack where you corrupt the
packet and if it succeeds anyway you know those bytes weren't used.

&gt;<i> Alternatively, maybe you could just append the encrypted bytes that made up your post of the payload from your incoming message: it was encrypted to you so should be effectively random to anyone else and will be garbled further when the next node &quot;decrypts&quot; it. That would save on entropy/crypto ops, and a constant message size would leak minimal info I think.
</I>
So rotate the payload?  I don't think that's verifiable by the
recipient, so has the same probing attack issue as above.

Hmm, what if we include a pubkey, and you use that to encrypt 0 padding?
The last hop gets the privkey (and boundary information), and she can
verify the padding.

Off the top of my head, that solves both the length problem, and the
&quot;route replacement&quot; problem.

But I've not had coffee yet, plus jetlag.  Could be missing a flaw or
simplification!

Thanks,
Rusty.
