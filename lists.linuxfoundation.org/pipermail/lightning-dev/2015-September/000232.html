&gt;<i> Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Close now has an second ACK stage, which means you know the close ack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    has been received.
</I>&gt;<i> Argh, I already have trouble understanding the rationale behind all
</I>&gt;<i> the existing closing flows and states :-s Would it be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> publish an updated version of the svg ? aj, any chance you could do
</I>&gt;<i> the same with your 'flat' version ?
</I>
Heh, this one is pretty easy.  It's just an ack at the end of the
mutual close handshake:

    close_channel
    close_channel_complete
    close_channel_ack (this is new).

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) HTLC rejection (eg. bad route, insufficient fees) added.
</I>&gt;<i> How about the 'commit tx too big' case ? will that just be an error ?
</I>
A protocol error: you should never propose a HTLC which will cause the
commit tx to be malformed.

&gt;&gt;<i> As a secondary effect, 32 bits places [an upper bound of 0.04 BTC]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (currently about $10USD) on each HTLC.  That's more than enough to cover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the micropayment uses of lightning, yet if you lose all your money due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a horrible bug in the early days, I can buy you a beer and count us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about even[1].  And we can change the protocol later if it becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overly limiting.
</I>
&gt;<i> Such a low ceiling bothers me a little bit, because it kind of states
</I>&gt;<i> that the micropayment use case is the primary target. Is it ? To me,
</I>&gt;<i> scalability and speed are the most interesting properties of
</I>&gt;<i> lightning.
</I>
I think the early adopters are going to be microtransactions.  And
they're good to have: they build the network, stress-test us, and let us
learn without risking too much.

&gt;<i> I would have preferred a higher (1 BTC ?) limit, but I
</I>&gt;<i> understand this can be changed. Regarding the risk of bugs, you can't
</I>&gt;<i> loose more than the channel capacity so that's another parameter we
</I>&gt;<i> can play with I guess.
</I>
My reference implementation refuses to create a channel which would
overflow this.  That was a simple check to implement (we already check
that no HTLC would spend more than channel capacity of course).

I use 64 bits internally, to avoid wrap issues anyway.

My general philosophy here is to underpromise, and over-deliver.  I
can't talk to all the users individually, but if we set *our*
expectations at &quot;beer money, not rent money&quot; that will hopefully spread.

I recommend reading one of the &quot;I was Goxxed&quot; reddit threads for some
heartbreaking perspective on what happens when innocent people get
caught up in hype :(

Cheers,
Rusty.
