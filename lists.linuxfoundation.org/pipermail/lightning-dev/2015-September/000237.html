I was thinking they all count as active.  No point turning over all the
beacons every block.

Interesting.  If we assume growth only (as I suggested) we end up with a
geometric distribution (as backed by Section 5 of
<A HREF="http://www.e-publications.org/ims/submission/index.php/BEJ/user/submissionFile/10315?confirm=c40442a0">http://www.e-publications.org/ims/submission/index.php/BEJ/user/submissionFile/10315?confirm=c40442a0</A>
).

It's not clear to me (without reading the paper) how much attachment
bias is required for a power law to apply, however.  Larger nodes may be
incentivized (through profit) to have better uptime, leading to a slight
attachment bias.  Definitely second order.

It's not clear that we want a power law: do we?

Cheers,
Rusty.
