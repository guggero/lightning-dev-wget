I don't think parallel probes work well - if any of your probes succeed, your neighbour knows R and can claim all of your probes. Parallelization is also limited by channel capacity, assuming the payee knows how much to expect.

I'm not sure probing is really plausible given mass deployment, is it? You have to guess the eventual recipient but given randomised routing you have every person or business using lightning as a potential candidate with possibly equal probability?

For a general solution, I think you could completely rule out probing by having two R values, one known only by the recipient, and one by the sender (call it S say). Then make the htlcs payable on presentation of both R and S and include S encrypted to the final recipient in the onion payload. Munging the payload then makes the htlc irredeemable so misrouting it gives no information.

(Please let me know if the formatting of this mail is too hopeless; trying out a new setup)

Cheers,
