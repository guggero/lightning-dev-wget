</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  c) potential beacons have to have committed to a beacon id prior to
</I>&gt;<i>     ordering being chosen (with spam/flooding protection)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  d) gossip protocol to announce potential beacons and compare against
</I>&gt;<i>     ordering, keeping the top few in memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  e) sharing routes to beacons with direct neighbours
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  f) distributed hash to store/lookup route recommendations, keyed by
</I>&gt;<i>     beacon/endpoint
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  g) distributed hash to lookup fees for hops keyed by hop ends
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think (a) is trivial; and you already called out (b).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For (c), not having a commitment means that people could generate a new
</I>&gt;<i> node id that does well in the ordering algorithm after the fact; if it's
</I>&gt;<i> SHA comparisons, that means miners would likely monopolise being a beacon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) How to avoid fake beacons?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Require a signature attached to an unspent bitcoin TX from before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    beacon selection?  That TXID is actually what competes to be close
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    to the beacon selector.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This might as well be the (an) anchor transaction. It's already in the
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain, it's already associated with a channel. You couldn't just
</I>&gt;<i> use the txid directly, because that wouldn't differentiate between
</I>&gt;<i> endpoints though. This would give an advantage to nodes with lots of
</I>&gt;<i> channels open; not sure whether that's desirable? Probably it is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For (d), once you've got the ordering, nodes tell each other about their
</I>&gt;<i> 12 favourite beacons, and if they hear about better ones, they pass those
</I>&gt;<i> on too. That needs to be global knowledge, but it doesn't matter too much
</I>&gt;<i> if we have slightly different sets of 12 beacons at any point.  12 beacon
</I>&gt;<i> ids is a fine amount of information to pass around globally, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For (e), I don't think you want to gossip globally about routes --
</I>&gt;<i> that's too much information to pass around if it's not necessary; but
</I>&gt;<i> you still have to share your routes to beacons with your neighbours in
</I>&gt;<i> order to figure anything out. Nodes announcing their best routes to their
</I>&gt;<i> neighbours is basically just Dijkstra's algorithm in parallel I think.
</I>
Indeed, it's trivial (and I've already implemented a simple simulator to
do it).  The initial spamminess can be mitigated by waiting before
broadcasting depending on how likely you are a beacon.

&gt;<i> But just knowing your neighbours' routes isn't enough; you need to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to lookup a route for anyone, and that (by definition I think)
</I>&gt;<i> means you need (f) a DHT of routes-to-beacons. Note that looking up a
</I>&gt;<i> route has privacy implications, in that it implies you're probably going
</I>&gt;<i> to make a payment along that route!
</I>
That's why the recipient provides a set of routes from (some subset of)
beacons to them.  You know routes to all beacons, so pathfinding solved.

&gt;&gt;<i> To receive a payment, B picks a few beacon nodes at random and sends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those routes (beacons -&gt; B) to A.  Presumably A knows its route to all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the beacon nodes and thus can choose the best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A trivial DHT would be to have each node store its routes locally,
</I>&gt;<i> and just make a TCP/IP connection to the node directly to ask for its
</I>&gt;<i> routes. That seems like it'd be pretty bad for privacy though. I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> fan of being able to route to/through nodes you can't reach via IP, and
</I>&gt;<i> this would prevent that too.
</I>
Yes, that's a bad idea.  And I'm not sure why you need this?

&gt;<i> Finally for (g), I don't think you want to store fees in the routes
</I>&gt;<i> directly, since updating fees would require updating an unknown number
</I>&gt;<i> of routes; but fees have to be queryable, so that's a separate DHT. This
</I>&gt;<i> one doesn't need to be updated when new beacons are elected though. This
</I>&gt;<i> DHT would want to be fairly high performance, because you're doing 2*B*L
</I>&gt;<i> lookups everytime you want to find a route, and it has to accept and
</I>&gt;<i> propogate updates fairly quickly if fees change.
</I>
Well, propagating fee updates for (say) 1200 routes isn't too bad,
as long as they're not changing too fast.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are some twisty details here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) How many beacon nodes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    12, and increase on a log scale with network size.  That size can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    be derived from previous beacons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's also something you could set per-node, like the
</I>&gt;<i> minrelaytxfee.
</I>
That doesn't make sense, since we need to agree on who is a beacon.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) How long between selection and a beacon becoming active?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    10 blocks.  That gives time for others to connect to beacon node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beacons can be &quot;active&quot; as soon as you can route through them, and that's
</I>&gt;<i> just a DHT lookup to determine, and then a matter of comparing fees to
</I>&gt;<i> what the old beacons give you. So I think no artificial delay is needed,
</I>&gt;<i> and the real question is just when you expire your routes to/from the
</I>&gt;<i> old beacons?
</I>
No.  Beacons will get saturated fast unless they have a chance to
prepare.  In particular, the network will want to establish channels
with new beacons, and beacons may well want to bring offline funds
online to handle the anticipated capacity.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) How long before a beacon node is invalid?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    No idea.  Let's keep a day's worth for the moment?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds fine; also mostly a client side parameter. (Though if the routing
</I>&gt;<i> DHT is non-trivial, old beacons should expire from there after some
</I>&gt;<i> interval too to deal with nodes that disappear)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) How to update beacon routing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Particularly for fee changes, this is important.  Best effort,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    with ratelimiting.  I hope eventually we'll have reasonable traffic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    models so a node can say &quot;I'm going to ramp up/down my fees for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    this long at this rate&quot; and have a reasonable chance that it's true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is reinventing DHTs, though maybe none of the existing ones
</I>&gt;<i> work well enough for this use case?
</I>
What's the fascination with DHTs?

&gt;<i> I think rate limiting decreases in fees is always safe (it won't prevent
</I>&gt;<i> any transactions going through, it will only prevent them being started).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not sure a programmed ramp-up/down of fees makes sense; though
</I>&gt;<i> maybe it would be a good way to perform price discovery)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS.  For the immediate term, we'll use a global comms mechanism like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      IRC, but that's just a prototype hack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. Counterproposal: no beacons or routing DHT, just fees by gossip
</I>&gt;<i> protocol (or IRC channel as prototype hack). Everyone has a complete
</I>&gt;<i> (but possibly slightly out of date) database of node-node (but not
</I>&gt;<i> node-wallet) channel fees, and changes are propogated by gossip. Back
</I>&gt;<i> of the envelope maths:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   everyone uses lightning ==&gt; 8B wallets (5B teens/adults, 3B businesses)
</I>&gt;<i>   every wallet has ~4 channels ==&gt; 32B node-wallet channels
</I>&gt;<i>   100k wallet channels per node on average ==&gt; 320k nodes
</I>
Um, so each wallet isn't a node?  That's a very different architecture,
which uses hosted wallets or something?  I don't think that's very
interesting.

Cheers,
Rusty.
