<PRE>&gt;<i> Both these indicate each wallet (end-user) is connected to just one node;
</I>&gt;<i> I'd expect the usual case to be two or three so you can more easily deal
</I>&gt;<i> with downtime by a node.
</I>Yes, I skipped that.

&gt;<i> If I'm an end-user with a wallet with two channels; and I switch my
</I>&gt;<i> software to being a full lightning node with the same two channels, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> end up in this state. Likewise if I was a new node trying to establish
</I>&gt;<i> myself on the network.
</I>I understand the idea and advantages of everybody running a node, to
be honest I implicitely discarded this possibility in favor of a
limited (10s ? 100s ?) number of specialized supernodes. I feel like
having a lot of small nodes that constantly appear and disappear is
somewhat incompatible with a reliable and low latency (&lt;1s ?) payment
network, but I admit I am probably too pessimistic !

&gt;<i> Also, if there's a lot of traffic from node A to node B, their channel
</I>&gt;<i> will become lopsided (B will own all the coins), if it turns out that
</I>&gt;<i> C has channels with both A and B, a circular transaction A -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> A would allow those channels to rebalance (and x-&gt;A-&gt;C-&gt;B-&gt;y would allow
</I>&gt;<i> x and y to continue to transact despite A-&gt;B being full). If that happens
</I>&gt;<i> a lot, it might be profitable for everyone concerned if &quot;C&quot; sets up a
</I>&gt;<i> node that only does that, and doesn't deal with end-users directly.
</I>This makes sense, although if I am not mistaken it can only be done
once, because then C will own all the coins in the channel A-C, and if
A-B becomes lopsided again A will need to find yet another circular
route. I would think in that case B would be more likely to cash out
as mentioned here :
<A HREF="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-September/000185.html.">http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-September/000185.html.</A>
In fact, I think that members of the lightning network will be
&quot;strongly typed&quot;: overall they will either mainly send or mainly
receive money.

&gt;<i> That's optimal for efficiency, but probably pessimal for privacy. If
</I>&gt;<i> lightning is fast and cheap enough, delaying things slightly for a
</I>&gt;<i> significant increase in privacy would be worthwhile.
</I>Agreed.

&gt;<i> Setting up channels isn't free, though -- it costs a blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, and locks up bitcoins for no value if the channel's idle --
</I>&gt;<i> so you also want to minimise the number of channels, not just the number
</I>&gt;<i> of hops for a transaction.
</I>This actually leads me to the &quot;supernode&quot; conclusion. End user would
only have a handful of channels set up with a few of those large,
well-connected nodes.
Just one remark on the fact that funds would be locked in a channel:
if lightning is widely successful and becomes the primary way of doing
payments, don't you think that this would change our perception of
which funds (in a wallet or in an open channel) are actually more
usable ?

&gt;&gt;<i> Then we just agree on a standard port and that's it !
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't it how the internet works already ? Why do we need an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application-level routing on top of the IP routing ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It'd be expensive to join the lightning network (if I wanted to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to send up to $5 to anyone, and there were 100 nodes on the
</I>&gt;<i> network, I'd need to commit $500 to lightning channels up front).
</I>In my view you would just be connected to a few nodes which would
handle the rest.

&gt;<i> 2) It'd be easy to block payments (USA bans anyone from setting up
</I>&gt;<i> channels with anyone in Cuba; Cubans can't run nodes)
</I>Good point...

&gt;<i> 3) If there's a communications blockage, there's no ability to route
</I>&gt;<i> around it.
</I>True, but this is mitigated by the fact that every participant of the
network would be connected to a few nodes, so we can imagine that a
merchant would require to be paid at <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">id1 at node1</A> or <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">id2 at node2</A> ?

Cheers,

Pierre
