<PRE>Hi Mats,

Yes, I agree whole heartedly! See my related comment here:
<A HREF="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-July/000018.html">http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-July/000018.html</A>

Two hashes are necessary for this type of invalidation.

Yes, seems like something to tack on later.
