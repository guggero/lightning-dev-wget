<PRE>Hi Pierre,

        Sorry for the delay; Blockstream had a big meeting after the
Montreal Scaling Bitcoin workshop, so I've been distracted.

Pierre &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">pm+lists at acinq.fr</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;&gt;<i> If I'm an end-user with a wallet with two channels; and I switch my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software to being a full lightning node with the same two channels, I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end up in this state. Likewise if I was a new node trying to establish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself on the network.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the idea and advantages of everybody running a node, to
</I>&gt;<i> be honest I implicitely discarded this possibility in favor of a
</I>&gt;<i> limited (10s ? 100s ?) number of specialized supernodes. I feel like
</I>&gt;<i> having a lot of small nodes that constantly appear and disappear is
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat incompatible with a reliable and low latency (&lt;1s ?) payment
</I>&gt;<i> network, but I admit I am probably too pessimistic !
</I>
Me too.  Initially I was thinking of hub and spokes like this.  It's
certainly far simpler to organize routing among a few thousand
supernodes.

But the interests of robustness privacy, decentralization, and the
tantalizing possibility of negative fees all point to a flatter
design (though I expect some power law to emerge).

&gt;&gt;<i> Setting up channels isn't free, though -- it costs a blockchain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transaction, and locks up bitcoins for no value if the channel's idle --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so you also want to minimise the number of channels, not just the number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of hops for a transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> This actually leads me to the &quot;supernode&quot; conclusion. End user would
</I>&gt;<i> only have a handful of channels set up with a few of those large,
</I>&gt;<i> well-connected nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> Just one remark on the fact that funds would be locked in a channel:
</I>&gt;<i> if lightning is widely successful and becomes the primary way of doing
</I>&gt;<i> payments, don't you think that this would change our perception of
</I>&gt;<i> which funds (in a wallet or in an open channel) are actually more
</I>&gt;<i> usable ?
</I>
Possibly.  But if it's the primary method of payments, you won't think
of them as &quot;locked in a channel&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then we just agree on a standard port and that's it !
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't it how the internet works already ? Why do we need an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> application-level routing on top of the IP routing ?
</I>
You still need non-IP routing, unfortunately.  It's an overlay network
of channels (probably across multiple networks, like TOR, UDP etc),
and there's no logical grouping to make routing tables smaller than
&quot;every node&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) It'd be expensive to join the lightning network (if I wanted to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to send up to $5 to anyone, and there were 100 nodes on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network, I'd need to commit $500 to lightning channels up front).
</I>&gt;<i> In my view you would just be connected to a few nodes which would
</I>&gt;<i> handle the rest.
</I>
Definitely.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) It'd be easy to block payments (USA bans anyone from setting up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channels with anyone in Cuba; Cubans can't run nodes)
</I>&gt;<i> Good point...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) If there's a communications blockage, there's no ability to route
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around it.
</I>&gt;<i> True, but this is mitigated by the fact that every participant of the
</I>&gt;<i> network would be connected to a few nodes, so we can imagine that a
</I>&gt;<i> merchant would require to be paid at <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">id1 at node1</A> or <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">id2 at node2</A> ?
</I>
I started exactly where you are!  I was forced to throw it away to try
to make it as distributed-by-default as possible.  That all nodes are
equal to by design, and we try to be clever with routing.

I think I have a method, too.  It won't scale infinitely, but might work
for a few million nodes...

Cheers,
Rusty.
