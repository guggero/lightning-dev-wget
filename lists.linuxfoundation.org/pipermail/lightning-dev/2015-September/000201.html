I think what you're implicitly assuming here is:

 a) global p2p network of lightning nodes; at a minimum each node has
    a connection to every node it has a channel open with

 b) consensus protocol for choosing an ordering of potential beacons

 c) potential beacons have to have committed to a beacon id prior to
    ordering being chosen (with spam/flooding protection)

 d) gossip protocol to announce potential beacons and compare against
    ordering, keeping the top few in memory.

 e) sharing routes to beacons with direct neighbours

 f) distributed hash to store/lookup route recommendations, keyed by
    beacon/endpoint

 g) distributed hash to lookup fees for hops keyed by hop ends


I think (a) is trivial; and you already called out (b).

For (c), not having a commitment means that people could generate a new
node id that does well in the ordering algorithm after the fact; if it's
SHA comparisons, that means miners would likely monopolise being a beacon.

&gt;<i> 4) How to avoid fake beacons?
</I>&gt;<i>    Require a signature attached to an unspent bitcoin TX from before
</I>&gt;<i>    beacon selection?  That TXID is actually what competes to be close
</I>&gt;<i>    to the beacon selector.
</I>
This might as well be the (an) anchor transaction. It's already in the
blockchain, it's already associated with a channel. You couldn't just
use the txid directly, because that wouldn't differentiate between
endpoints though. This would give an advantage to nodes with lots of
channels open; not sure whether that's desirable? Probably it is?

For (d), once you've got the ordering, nodes tell each other about their
12 favourite beacons, and if they hear about better ones, they pass those
on too. That needs to be global knowledge, but it doesn't matter too much
if we have slightly different sets of 12 beacons at any point.  12 beacon
ids is a fine amount of information to pass around globally, too.

For (e), I don't think you want to gossip globally about routes --
that's too much information to pass around if it's not necessary; but
you still have to share your routes to beacons with your neighbours in
order to figure anything out. Nodes announcing their best routes to their
neighbours is basically just Dijkstra's algorithm in parallel I think.

But just knowing your neighbours' routes isn't enough; you need to be
able to lookup a route for anyone, and that (by definition I think)
means you need (f) a DHT of routes-to-beacons. Note that looking up a
route has privacy implications, in that it implies you're probably going
to make a payment along that route!

&gt;<i> To receive a payment, B picks a few beacon nodes at random and sends
</I>&gt;<i> those routes (beacons -&gt; B) to A.  Presumably A knows its route to all
</I>&gt;<i> the beacon nodes and thus can choose the best.
</I>
A trivial DHT would be to have each node store its routes locally,
and just make a TCP/IP connection to the node directly to ask for its
routes. That seems like it'd be pretty bad for privacy though. I'm a
fan of being able to route to/through nodes you can't reach via IP, and
this would prevent that too.

Finally for (g), I don't think you want to store fees in the routes
directly, since updating fees would require updating an unknown number
of routes; but fees have to be queryable, so that's a separate DHT. This
one doesn't need to be updated when new beacons are elected though. This
DHT would want to be fairly high performance, because you're doing 2*B*L
lookups everytime you want to find a route, and it has to accept and
propogate updates fairly quickly if fees change.

&gt;<i> There are some twisty details here:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) How many beacon nodes?
</I>&gt;<i>    12, and increase on a log scale with network size.  That size can
</I>&gt;<i>    be derived from previous beacons.
</I>
I think it's also something you could set per-node, like the
minrelaytxfee.

&gt;<i> 2) How long between selection and a beacon becoming active?
</I>&gt;<i>    10 blocks.  That gives time for others to connect to beacon node.
</I>
Beacons can be &quot;active&quot; as soon as you can route through them, and that's
just a DHT lookup to determine, and then a matter of comparing fees to
what the old beacons give you. So I think no artificial delay is needed,
and the real question is just when you expire your routes to/from the
old beacons?

&gt;<i> 3) How long before a beacon node is invalid?
</I>&gt;<i>    No idea.  Let's keep a day's worth for the moment?
</I>
Sounds fine; also mostly a client side parameter. (Though if the routing
DHT is non-trivial, old beacons should expire from there after some
interval too to deal with nodes that disappear)

&gt;<i> 5) How to update beacon routing?
</I>&gt;<i>    Particularly for fee changes, this is important.  Best effort,
</I>&gt;<i>    with ratelimiting.  I hope eventually we'll have reasonable traffic
</I>&gt;<i>    models so a node can say &quot;I'm going to ramp up/down my fees for
</I>&gt;<i>    this long at this rate&quot; and have a reasonable chance that it's true.
</I>
I think this is reinventing DHTs, though maybe none of the existing ones
work well enough for this use case?

I think rate limiting decreases in fees is always safe (it won't prevent
any transactions going through, it will only prevent them being started).

(I'm not sure a programmed ramp-up/down of fees makes sense; though
maybe it would be a good way to perform price discovery)

&gt;<i> PS.  For the immediate term, we'll use a global comms mechanism like
</I>&gt;<i>      IRC, but that's just a prototype hack.
</I>
Hmm. Counterproposal: no beacons or routing DHT, just fees by gossip
protocol (or IRC channel as prototype hack). Everyone has a complete
(but possibly slightly out of date) database of node-node (but not
node-wallet) channel fees, and changes are propogated by gossip. Back
of the envelope maths:

  everyone uses lightning ==&gt; 8B wallets (5B teens/adults, 3B businesses)
  every wallet has ~4 channels ==&gt; 32B node-wallet channels
  100k wallet channels per node on average ==&gt; 320k nodes
  16 channels to other nodes per node ==&gt; 2.5M node-node channels
  (average path length between nodes ~= 4 hops)
  128b id per node, 32b fee per direction ==&gt; ~100MB of graph data

An update rate of 10kB/s allows fees to update up to once every three
hours on average; 100kB/s would be once every 20 minutes or so. Those
numbers aren't /great/ but don't seem completely infeasible. Probably
needs some signatures or similar to avoid DoS by spam which would slow
things down by maybe a factor of two.

If you do know the entire graph, you don't need to give away any
information about who you want to pay prior to sending the transaction.
Knowing the graph is potentially interesting for commercial and academic
reasons beyond wanting privacy. (Knowing the fees others charge helps you
work out what fees you should charge; but just querying your neighbours'
routes is probably sufficient to work that out too)

You can even do it so that only nodes (not wallets) need to know the
full graph, I think. If you're running a wallet without the full graph,
when finding a route, you:

 - get a list of most/all nodes (about 5MB; maybe you already have this,
   or can just rsync changes)
 - determine how oniony you want to be, picking n nodes, including your
   desired destination, and one or more of the nodes you have channels
   open with
 - ask for the shortest path between each pair of those nodes
 - build a cheap path out of that data

Even if n=2 (your node and their node), you only reveal you're paying
one of 100k wallets; and with larger n, any particular node could just be
being used for onion routing, so you're adding ~100k potential recipient
wallets with each additional node. (Initially, it won't be &quot;100k&quot; per
node so that doesn't work so well, but initially you could happily run
a full node rather than a wallet anyway)

When asking for payment, you just indicate your id, and one or more nodes
you have a channel open to. You probably have to indicate the final hop
fee for each node as well, since that can't be looked up in the graph.
