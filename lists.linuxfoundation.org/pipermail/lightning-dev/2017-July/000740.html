Some feedback, since I missed what seems like a very productive
discussion!

&gt;<i> HTLC floor created by second-level HTLC transactions 
</I>&gt;<i> Pierre points out that should choose HTLC min high enough that don&#8217;t run into issues.
</I>&gt;<i> Laolu points out this means that unable to send and claim small-ish amounts chain. 
</I>&gt;<i> Laolu points out that would basically CREATE a dust output in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> LAOLU SUGGESTS THAT TRIM OUTPUT SPEC PORTION SHOULD ALSO SAY DON&#8217;T CREATE DUST OUTPUT ON SECOND LEVEL TX
</I>
I think it does already:

  For every offered HTLC, if the HTLC amount minus the HTLC-timeout fee
  would be less than `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the transaction owner,
  the commitment transaction MUST NOT contain that output

(Similarly for received HTLCs)

ie. don't create HTLC outputs which would need an HTLC tx with a dust
output.

&gt;<i> Don&#8217;t use sighash-all on the second-level HTLC transactions
</I>&gt;<i>   Laolu points out that this would allow us to coalesce many HTLC
</I>&gt;<i>   transactions into a single one. Saves on-chain foot print, and also
</I>&gt;<i>   allows to add more fees.  Basically like &#8220;Lighthouse&#8221; (by hearn).
</I>
So, you're suggesting SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY?

I *think* this would work, though it's a pretty obscure case where we
want to close out many HTLCs at once; this is more for fee bumping I
think.

There are two other cases where we don't rely on the TXID, and such an
approach would be possible:

1. Commitment tx with no HTLC outputs.
2. The closing transaction.

Cheers,
Rusty.
