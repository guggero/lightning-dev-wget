<PRE>Right, I kinda agree here in the sense that there are things that very
significantly help mitigate the issue, but a) I'm not aware of any
clients implementing it (and the equivalent mitigations in Bitcoin Core
are targeted at a different class of issue, and are not sufficient
here), and b) its somewhat unclear what the &quot;emergency action&quot; would be.
Even if you implement detection, figuring out how to do a fallback is
nontrivial, especially if you are concerned with user privacy.

</I>&gt;<i> - Normal: when Alice is requesting blocks from honest nodes because

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Pathological: when Alice is requesting blocks from a eclipse attacker,
</I>&gt;<i>   those dishonest nodes are telling her she's already at the chain tip
</I>&gt;<i>   even though the latest block they serve her has a header timestamp
</I>&gt;<i>   that's hours or days old.  (Alternatively, they're reporting the
</I>&gt;<i>   latest block height but refusing to serve her blocks/headers past a
</I>&gt;<i>   certain point in the past.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems pretty easy to me to detect the difference between the normal
</I>&gt;<i> case (Alice's chaintip is old but she's still successfully downloading
</I>&gt;<i> blocks) and the pathological case (Alice's chaintip is old and she's
</I>&gt;<i> unable to obtain more recent blocks).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A possibly optimal attack strategy would be to combine
</I>&gt;<i> commitment/penalty transaction censorship with plausible block delays.
</I>&gt;<i> To a point, transaction censorship just looks a failure to pay a
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient feerate---so a node will probably fee bump a
</I>&gt;<i> commitment/penalty transaction a few times before it starts to panic.
</I>&gt;<i> Also to a point, a delay of up to several hours[2] just looks like
</I>&gt;<i> regular stochastic block production.  By using both deceits in the same
</I>&gt;<i> attack to the maximum possible degree without triggering an alarm, an
</I>&gt;<i> attacker can maximum their chance of stealing funds.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] There is an interesting case where a large miner or cartel of miners
</I>&gt;<i>     could deliberately trigger a false positive of block delay
</I>&gt;<i>     protection by manipulating Median Time Past (MTP) to allow them to
</I>&gt;<i>     set their header nTime fields to values from hours or days ago.  I
</I>&gt;<i>     don't believe the fix for the time warp proposed in the consensus
</I>&gt;<i>     cleanup soft fork fixes this, since it only directly affects the
</I>&gt;<i>     first block in a new difficulty period (preventing difficulty gaming
</I>&gt;<i>     but not header time gaming).  This problem is partly mitigated by
</I>&gt;<i>     miners keeping MTP far in the past being unable to claim fees from
</I>&gt;<i>     recent time locked transactions (see BIP113), though I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i>     how many transactions are actually using nLockTime-as-a-time (LN and
</I>&gt;<i>     anti-fee sniping use it as a height).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [2] If we suddenly lose half of Bitcoin's hashrate so that the average
</I>&gt;<i>     time between blocks is 20 minutes, there's a once-in-a-century
</I>&gt;<i>     chance of a block taking more than 310 minutes to produce:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         1 / (exp(-310/20) * 144 * 365)
