<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj and Aj,

Thanks for starting this discussion ZmnSCPxj. Although transactions with
relative lock times are easily distinguishable today, couldn't this
situation be improved? Even just a few wallets changing their behaviour to
set relative time locks on normal payments would weaken the heuristic. From
a design perspective it feels like leaving the improvement vector open
would be better.

Aj's model of scriptless lightning is more or less what I had in my mind
(but with much better detail). On the question of &quot;script based payment
points&quot; or &quot;fully scriptless&quot;: Why not just do both?

Since the tapscript version is faster to the &quot;irrevocably committed&quot; state,
you first do that so you can forward the payment as fast as possible. Now
that both parties have a commitment tx with a tapscript PTLC, they can (in
no hurry) sign the scriptless spending transactions from the PTLC output. I
think once they have signatures on their scriptless PTLC transactions they
can forget all the tapscript data (to minimize the data they have to store
per commitment tx).

&gt;<i> But with taproot you can have a script path as well, so you could have a
</I>&gt;<i> script:
</I>
&gt;<i>    A CHECKSIGVERIFY B CHECKSIG
</I>
&gt;<i> and supply a partial signature:
</I>
&gt;<i>    R+X,s,X where s = r + H(R+X,A,m)*a
</I>
&gt;<i> to allow them to satisfy &quot;A CHECKSIGVERIFY&quot; if they know the discrete
</I>&gt;<i> log of X, and of course they can sign with B at any time. This is only
</I>&gt;<i> half a round trip, and can be done at the same time as sending the &quot;I
</I>&gt;<i> want to do a PTLC for X&quot; message to setup the (ultimately cheaper) MuSig
</I>&gt;<i> spend. It's an extra signature on the sender's side and an extra
</I>verification
&gt;<i> on the receiver's side, but I think it works out fine.
</I>
This is exactly how I thought the &quot;script based payment point&quot; would work
where you just replace the hashing with an CHECKSIG and an adaptor sig.
Like Z, I don't see how you can get away with just that though. I think you
need to do a full tapscript PTLC and revocation (1.5 round trips) before
you can forward a payment.

Cheers,

LL
