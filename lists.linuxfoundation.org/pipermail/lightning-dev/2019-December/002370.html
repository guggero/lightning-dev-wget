<PRE>Nice writeup!

In further in-person discussions today, it was noted that the key
last-resort fallback Bitcoin Core has to week out peers in case of an
Eclipse Attack does not protect from this style of attack. While it is
only of limited concern for most Bitcoin Core users, it very much may
expose lightning nodes to theft.

More importantly, while Bitcoin Core has some protections against
generic sybil-based Eclipse attacks, they are far from sufficient in a
model like Lightning where much more is at stake from simple no-hashrate
Eclipse attacks.

The proposed countermeasure here of &quot;raising alarms&quot; in case the
best-block nTime field is too far behind is compelling in a
SPV-assumption world, though it is far from sufficient if the time delay
is small (eg for lightning HTLC delays or if the to_self_delay is
gratuitously insecure, eg under 144).

Sadly, however, &quot;raising alarms&quot; is not sufficient to protect users, as
countermeasures likely need to be taken automatically for any kind of
compelling security.

I'd encourage Lightning node authors and operators to ensure they have
multiple, redundant, trusted methods of receiving Bitcoin block data in
a timely fashion. To shill my own bags, of late I've been thinking about
such systems and expose services to fetch header/BIP157 filter data over
DNS [1, 2], header data over arbitrary radio interfaces [3] and full
block data over HTTP. Finally, there is also a parallel P2P
implementation which attempts to make different tradeoffs from the
existing Bitcoin Core P2P implementation and is much more aggressive
about seeking additional connections if there is evidence of headers
which are better than our current chain at [5], relying on some of the
other mechanisms to seek header data.

Note that the Bitcoin Core-based work here also includes what I hope can
be used as an arbitrary easy-to-write-additional-block-fetch-methods
framework.

you should be able to pick up headers in the 915 MHz band over LoRa with
this patch in the New York City area already :)

</I>&gt;<i> ===================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning works on reversing the double-spend problem to a private
</I>&gt;<i> state between parties instead of being a public issue verified by every
</I>&gt;<i> network peer. The security model is based on revocation of previous
</I>&gt;<i> states and in case of broadcast of any of them, being aware of it to
</I>&gt;<i> generate justice transactions to claim misbehaving peer onchain outputs
</I>&gt;<i> before contest period expiration. This period is driven by the blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> which is here the system clock.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse attacks's end-goal is to monopolize a victim's incoming and
</I>&gt;<i> outgoing connections, by this way isolating a node from the rest of its
</I>&gt;<i> peers in the network. A successful Eclipse attacks lets the attacker
</I>&gt;<i> filter the victim's view of the blockchain, i.e he controls transactions
</I>&gt;<i> and blocks announcements [0].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Every LN node must be tied to a bitcoin full-node or light-client to
</I>&gt;<i> verify independently channels opening/closing, HTLCs expiration and
</I>&gt;<i> previous/latest state broadcast. To operate securely, the view of the
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain must be up-to-date with the one shared with the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> network. By considering Eclipse attacks on the base layer, this assumption
</I>&gt;<i> can be broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First scenario : Targeting the CSV security delay
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alice and Mallory are LN peers with a channel opened at state N. They
</I>&gt;<i> use a CSV of 144 blocks as a security parameter for contestation period.
</I>&gt;<i> Mallory is able to identify Alice full-node and start to eclipse it.
</I>&gt;<i> When done, it keeps announcing blocks to Alice node but delaying them by
</I>&gt;<i> 2min. Given a variance of 10min, after 6 blocks, Mallory will have a
</I>&gt;<i> height ahead of Alice of 1, after 24 blocks, a lead of 4, after 144,
</I>&gt;<i> a lead of 24, after 1008, a lead of 168.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After maintaining the eclipse for a week, Mallory will have more than a
</I>&gt;<i> day of height advance on Alice view of blockchain. The difference being
</I>&gt;<i> superior at the CSV timelock, Mallory can broadcast a previous
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction at state N - 10 with a balance far more favorable
</I>&gt;<i> than the legit one at height H, the synchronized height with the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of the network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At revoked commitment transaction broadcast, Alice is slow down at
</I>&gt;<i> height H - 168. At H+144, Mallory can unlock its funds out of the
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction outputs and by so closing the contestation period
</I>&gt;<i> while Alice is still stuck at H-24. When Alice learn about revoked
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast at H, it's already too late. Mallory may have stopped the
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse attack after H+144, or he may pursue the attack on Alice because
</I>&gt;<i> of targeting multiple of her channels in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second scenario : Targeting the per-hop CLTV-delta
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alice, Bob and Caroll are LN peers with channel Alice-Bob and Bob-Caroll.
</I>&gt;<i> Bob enforce a cltv_delta of 12 blocks on incoming HTLCs. Alice and Caroll
</I>&gt;<i> are both malicious and start to eclipse Alice full-node until they gain a
</I>&gt;<i> lead of 15 blocks on Alice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At height N, Alice route a payment E to Caroll through Bob with a base
</I>&gt;<i> delta of 24 blocks. On channel AB, HTLC will expire at height H+24, on
</I>&gt;<i> channel BC, it will expire at height H+12 while Alice ticking herself
</I>&gt;<i> at height H-15.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When real-network blockchain height reaches H+24, Caroll provides
</I>&gt;<i> preimage P to Bob and following protocol rules she gets a new
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction with balance increased of HTLC E. At same time,
</I>&gt;<i> Alice broadcast unilaterally commitment transaction for AB and claim
</I>&gt;<i> back HTLC E with a HTLC-timeout transaction as its nLockTime is already
</I>&gt;<i> final. Bob wrongly clocking at height H+9, HTLC on channel BC won't have
</I>&gt;<i> been timeout by him and provided preimage is now useless as HTLC as
</I>&gt;<i> already claimed back on mainnet blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attack difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Following Eclipse attack paper publication, multiple counter-measures
</I>&gt;<i> have been implemented [1], [2]. Even if it's far harder, this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> attacks may still be possible for an off-path attacker. Including recent
</I>&gt;<i> changes, research should be done to ascertain it. Beyond, it still
</I>&gt;<i> widely feasible for attackers controlling key infrastructure between
</I>&gt;<i> the victim and the network [3]. A simple Tier 3 ISP doing deep packet
</I>&gt;<i> inspection and delaying your blocks may be able to practice this class
</I>&gt;<i> of attacks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The case of LN nodes using light clients, like BIP157 or Electrum, as a
</I>&gt;<i> backend should be specially considered. Given the low number of servers
</I>&gt;<i> providing these services today it should be trivial for an attacker to run
</I>&gt;<i> swarm of them and from then control blockchain view of this class of LN
</I>&gt;<i> nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another difficulty of the attack, is to map the LN node to its full-node.
</I>&gt;<i> This can range from being trivial if both run in clear with same ipv4
</I>&gt;<i> address. It would be interesting to scan both networks and see how many
</I>&gt;<i> nodes pair are in this case. Learning the mapping can still be doable if
</I>&gt;<i> they are using an anonymous network like Tor with same exit node base on
</I>&gt;<i> message timing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Further inter-layer mapping techniques could be developped like funding
</I>&gt;<i> transaction broadcast and seeing its propagation on the base layer. Or
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of onchain utxo graph leaked by addressed reused to fund
</I>&gt;<i> channels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the LN-side, depending of the scenario, cost of the attack ranges
</I>&gt;<i> between opening one or two channels and paying the related onchain fees.
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, an attacker can also target victim-initiated channels
</I>&gt;<i> and costs would be reduced only to operating LN nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Onchain counter-measures
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Warnings could be triggered by full-node when the block issuance rate
</I>&gt;<i> becomes weird but first it's hard to dissociate weirdness from edges of
</I>&gt;<i> block variance and secondly the algo being public it should be easy for
</I>&gt;<i> an attacker to stay under the radar by choosing the right announcement
</I>&gt;<i> delay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Raising alarms based on nTime of block headers being to far in the past
</I>&gt;<i> compare to local clock wouldn't make sense due to IBD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A practical solution would be to have multiple bitcoin full-nodes
</I>&gt;<i> with multi-homing and doing reconciliation of blockchain views every
</I>&gt;<i> N hour/minute. This kind of method, already deployed by some bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructures, would raise attack difficulty for off-path attackers
</I>&gt;<i> but wouldn't counter in-path attackers. Nevertheless, it would already
</I>&gt;<i> be a good step, the issue is the current absent of implementing this
</I>&gt;<i> in open-source software for hobbyists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A defense in depth would require to have multiple data links, like
</I>&gt;<i> receiving headers from space/radio or tunneling through
</I>&gt;<i> some other protocols [4].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even learning discrepancies between your local view of the blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> and the mainnet one, the right move to do isn't clear as an automatic
</I>&gt;<i> system may be triggered by false positives to halt operation of your LN
</I>&gt;<i> node, a human intervention to double-check may seem preferable. And
</I>&gt;<i> it's really likely the attacker control you ability of transactions
</I>&gt;<i> on the base layer. BIP324 may help there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Offchain counter-measures
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some LN errors messages may be triggered at abnormal rate like
</I>&gt;<i> `expiry_too_soon` &#160;due to victim using a HTLC base in the past and may
</I>&gt;<i> be used to guess oddities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A measure orthogonal to running multiple bitcoin full-nodes should be
</I>&gt;<i> to have multiples watchtowers running their own blocks provider (full-node
</I>&gt;<i> or light clients). Assuming attacker don't control your connection to them,
</I>&gt;<i> if at least one of them isn't eclipsed, it should be able to time-out HTLC/
</I>&gt;<i> justice revoked transaction efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another option would be to use the control plane as a safety mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> When a LN node learns a channel_announcement to far in the future it
</I>&gt;<i> would ask to this LN node, few next headers through this communication
</I>&gt;<i> channel and connect these headers to its full-node. Based on this
</I>&gt;<i> information, full-node may trigger alarms more accurately. This mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> would work assuming one of your gossiping LN node is honest. It may ask
</I>&gt;<i> for fine-tuning to avoid there too false-positives but it seems an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting topic of research to use L2 information to correct L1 blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> view and even further to use L2 communications channels as an emergency
</I>&gt;<i> transaction broadcast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Further research could be lead to investigate attacks combining
</I>&gt;<i> eclipsing victim
</I>&gt;<i> view of both layer, that's said the LN one may seem harder to take on as
</I>&gt;<i> nodes
</I>&gt;<i> have persistent identities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse attacks were already known to be very bad, offchain protocols
</I>&gt;<i> relying on time for their security model make them worst at it lower the bar
</I>&gt;<i> to exploit them from being a miner to being party to an offchain contract.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After talking with LN implementations teams, they don't think funds are
</I>&gt;<i> at risks,
</I>&gt;<i> given than light clients have low-value channels right now and it's not
</I>&gt;<i> worthy the
</I>&gt;<i> attack setup, but they acknowledge the issue on the long term for
</I>&gt;<i> processing nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Gleb Naumenko for fruitful discussions/review.
</I>&gt;<i>
