<PRE>This is the first in a series of posts on ideas to improve the usability
and scalability of the Lightning Network. This post presents a new channel
protocol that allows casual users to send and receive Lightning payments
without having to meet onerous availability requirements or use a
watchtower service. This new Watchtower-Free (WF) protocol can also be
used to simplify the reception of Lightning payments for casual users. No
change to the underlying Bitcoin protocol is required.

A paper with a more complete description of the protocol, including
figures, is available [5].

Properties
==========

The user-visible properties of the WF protocol can be expressed using
two parameters:
* I_S: a short time interval (e.g., 10 minutes) for communicating with
  peers, checking the blockchain, and submitting transactions to the
  blockchain, and
* I_L: a long time interval (e.g., 1-3 months).

The casual user must be online for up to:
* I_S every I_L (e.g., 10 minutes every 1-3 months) to safeguard the funds
  in their Lightning channel.

With the WF protocol, the latency for payments is unchanged from the
current protocol, but the latency for getting a payment receipt from an
uncooperative channel partner is increased. In addition, the casual user
may have to pay their channel partner for the partner's cost of capital
(which depends on I_L). If the casual user and their channel partner
follow the protocol, the channel can remain off-chain arbitrarily long.

First Attempt: Use The Current Lightning Protocol
=================================================

In order to motivate the new protocol, first consider what would happen if
a casual user attempted to achieve the above properties with the current
Lightning channel protocol. The casual user would set their
&quot;to_self_delay&quot; (which controls how quickly their channel partner can
receive funds from a transaction they put on-chain) and
&quot;cltv_expiry_delta&quot; (which controls the staggering of timeouts between
successive hops) parameters to values approaching I_L (because the casual
user could be unavailable for nearly that long). This would create three
problems:

* Problem 1: The casual user's proposed channel partner would likely
  reject the creation of the channel due to the excessive &quot;to_self_delay&quot;
  value.

* Problem 2: If a channel were created with these parameters, Lightning
  payments would not be routed through it due to the excessive
  &quot;cltv_expiry_delta&quot; value.

* Problem 3: If a channel were created with these parameters and if the
  casual user sent a payment on that channel, their partner could have to
  go on-chain in order to pull the payment from the casual user. In
  particular, the casual user could be offline for nearly I_L (e.g., 1-3
  months) when their partner receives the receipt, thus forcing their
  partner to go on-chain to receive payment before the expiry of the
  associated HTLC.

The WF Protocol
===============

The WF protocol solves these problems by modifying the Lightning protocol
as follows:

* Problem 1 is solved by having the casual user pre-pay their channel
  partner for the cost of the partner's capital that's tied up in the
  channel due to the very large &quot;to_self_delay&quot; value. This pre-payment is
  included in the initial channel state and is updated at least once every
  I_L to reflect the additional cost of capital due to the partner not yet
  going on-chain.

* Problem 2 is solved by allowing casual users to designate themselves as
  Casual-Lightning-Users (CLUs), while the remaining users are
  Dedicated-Lightning-Users (DLUs). CLUs can only partner with DLUs to
  open channels, such channels must be unannounced, and CLUs must not
  route (as opposed to send or receive) payments. These constraints fit
  naturally with the desires of casual users who want to send and receive
  their Lightning payments, but not route payments for others. Support for
  CLUs is analogous to support for SPV (Simplified-Payment-Verification)
  nodes in Bitcoin.

* Problem 3 is solved by modifying both users' Commitment transactions in
  the channel that sends the payment so the CLU can be offline for nearly
  I_L without forcing their DLU partner to go on-chain. A simple approach
  would be to delay the expiry of the HTLC for each payment in the sending
  channel by I_L. This approach works, but it has the downside of delaying
  (by I_L) the CLU's ability to force production of a payment receipt. A
  better approach is to add a relative delay before the CLU can time out
  the HTLC output of a Commitment transaction, thus enabling the DLU to
  safely stay off-chain even after the expiry of the HTLC. That's the
  approach taken here.

Let Alice be a CLU who shares a channel with DLU Bob. Bob sets his channel
parameters as he would in the current Lightning protocol, while Alice sets
her &quot;to_self_delay&quot; parameter (controlling Bob's payments to himself) to
I_L greater than it would be in the current Lightning protocol. Consider
the case where Alice sends a Lightning payment on the channel she shares
with Bob.

Let:
  - eAB denote the expiry for this payment in the channel shared by Alice
    and Bob,
  - tsdA denote the &quot;to_self_delay&quot; parameter set by Alice, and
  - tsdB denote the &quot;to_self_delay&quot; parameter set by Bob.

Three changes are made relative to the current Lightning protocol:
  - a relative delay of tsdB is enforced before Alice can spend the HTLC
    output for this payment in either Commitment transaction,
  - after eAB, only Alice's (rather than both parties') signature is
    required to spend the HTLC output in Alice's Commitment transaction,
    and that output doesn't need to be spent using an HTLC-timeout
    transaction that can be revoked (because the relative delay added
    above guarantees Bob can prevent Alice from spending the HTLC output
    in a revoked Commitment transaction that she puts on-chain), and
  - both parties update the channel state off-chain at least once every
    I_L to reflect Bob's cost of capital, as described above.

The resulting protocol, with a single payment from Alice outstanding, is
shown below:

where:
F is the Funding transaction,
CC is the Cooperative Close transaction,
C_Ai is Alice's Commitment transaction for state i,
C_Bi is Bob's Commitment transaction for state i, and
Hs_Bi is Bob's HTLC-success transaction for state i.

The F transaction is on-chain, while the remaining transactions are
off-chain during normal protocol operation.

Requirements for output cases are as follows:
A: Alice's signature,
B: Bob's signature,
AB: Alice's and Bob's signatures,
revkeyAi: a signature using a revocation key that Alice can use to revoke
          Bob's state i transaction,
revkeyBi: a signature using a revocation key that Bob can use to revoke
          Alice's state i transaction,
tsdA: a relative delay equal to Alice's to_self_delay parameter,
tsdB: a relative delay equal to Bob's to_self_delay parameter,
(eAB): an absolute timelock equal to the expiry of the outstanding HTLC
       offered by Alice, and
Preimage(X): the hash preimage of X.

Once Bob knows Preimage(X), he sends Preimage(X) to Alice and attempts to
update both parties' Commitment transactions to show payment of the HTLC.
If he has spent I_L time unsuccessfully trying to update those Commitment
transactions, he can submit his Commitment and HTLC-success transactions
to the blockchain. If at any point he sees Alice's Commitment transaction
on-chain, he stops trying to update the Commitment transactions off-chain
and he puts his transaction that reveals Preimage(X) and spends the HTLC
output in her Commitment transaction on-chain as soon as possible.

Alice implements the WF channel protocol as she would the current
Lightning channel protocol, except:
 - she can choose to be intentionally unavailable, provided she is
   available (or at least not intentionally unavailable) for at least I_S
   every I_L (to update her pre-payment for Bob's cost of capital and to
   revoke any old transactions put on-chain by Bob), and
 - she does not put her Commitment transaction on-chain until she has
   been available (or at least not intentionally unavailable) for at least
   a grace period of G following the expiry of her offered HTLC (where G
   is the same grace period as is used in the current Lightning protocol
   and G &lt;= I_S).

Correctness
===========

When Alice sends a payment on the channel she shares with Bob, the WF
protocol matches the Lightning protocol except the parties stay off-chain
longer with the WF protocol (to accommodate Alice's intentional
unavailability). Staying off-chain longer is safe for Alice, as she
originated the payment and thus does not have to time out the HTLC at any
specific time in order receive payment in an earlier hop. Staying
off-chain longer is also safe for Bob, because whenever Alice's (or Bob's)
Commitment transaction is put on-chain, the tsdB relative delay before
Alice can time out the HTLC output is long enough to allow Bob to put his
transaction on-chain that takes payment for the HTLC.

Finally, the WF protocol requires that Alice and Bob stay off-chain long
enough to guarantee that Alice will be available (or at least not
intentionally unavailable) for at least G, which is sufficient for both
parties to update the channel state off-chain. As a result, if both
parties follow the protocol, the channel will remain off-chain despite
Alice's intentional unavailability.

A more detailed proof of correctness is given in the paper [5].

One-Shot Receives
=================

While eliminating watchtowers is helpful for casual users, the protocol
for receiving Lightning payments could still be awkward for such users.
With the current Lightning protocol, when a user receives a payment and
their channel partner is unresponsive, the user must submit their
Commitment and HTLC-success transactions to the blockchain. However, if
their partner's conflicting Commitment transaction wins the race and is
included in the blockchain, the user then has to submit a different
transaction that reveals the HTLC's secret and spends the HTLC output in
their partner's Commitment transaction. The requirement to wait and check
the blockchain for the winning Commitment transaction (which might not be
determined until multiple blocks have been added to the blockchain) is
awkward for a casual user. It would be far preferable if the casual user
could always receive a payment by performing a sequence of off-chain
message exchanges and at most one submission to the blockchain. A protocol
that has this property will be said to support &quot;one-shot receives&quot;.

The WF protocol can be made to support one-short receives (and to simplify
the process of getting a receipt) for CLU Alice by making the following
change whenever a new Commitment transaction for DLU Bob is signed by
Alice:
 - if Bob has one or more outstanding HTLCs offered to Alice, the
   nLocktime field of Bob's Commitment transaction is set to the expiry of
   the earliest such HTLC,
 - otherwise, the nLocktime field of Bob's Commitment transaction is set
   to I_L in the future (relative to when Bob's Commitment transaction is
   signed by Alice).

Before examining how this change supports one-shot receives, it's
important to resolve a technical issue. In the current Lightning protocol,
the nLocktime field in the Commitment transaction provides 24 bits of the
channel's state number in order to allow efficient revocation of old
on-chain Commitments (with the remaining 24 bits being provided by the
nSequence field of the Commitment transaction's sole input). Because we're
now using the nLocktime field to enforce an absolute timelock, those 24
bits of state number can no longer be encoded in the nLocktime field.
There are two solutions to this problem:
 - add a second input to Bob's Commitment transaction that spends a UTXO
   owned by Bob (the value of which is arbitrary and is refunded to Bob in
   the Commitment transaction) and use the nSequence field of that input
   to encode 24 bits of state number, or
 - support only 24-bit state numbers, as 16 million channel states are
   likely sufficient for most casual users.

In addition, the following constraints are added in order to guarantee
one-shot receives:
1. Whenever a new HTLC is offered to Alice, its expiry is set to exactly
   her min_final_cltv_expiry parameter in the future. This constraint
   guarantees that new HTLCs have expiries that are monotonically
   nondecreasing.
2. Whenever Alice gives Bob a secret for an HTLC, that HTLC has the
   earliest expiry of all the HTLCs in Alice's current Commitment
   transaction.
3. Whenever a new channel state i+1 is created, Alice's partial signature
   for Bob's Commitment transaction for state i+1 is given to Bob, and the
   revocation key for Bob's Commitment transaction for state i is given to
   Alice, before Bob's partial signature for Alice's Commitment
   transaction for state i+1 is given to Alice.

Given these constraints and the setting of the nLocktime field in Bob's
Commitment transaction, Alice can always put her Commitment transaction
on-chain before Bob can put a conflicting current Commitment transaction
on-chain, thus providing one-shot receives. The details are provided in
the paper [5].

Finally, it's important to verify that the delay of Bob's Commitment
transaction (caused by the setting of its nLocktime field) does not create
any problems for Bob. First, for HTLCs offered to Alice (that is, payments
received by Alice), the current Lightning protocol requires that Bob wait
until after the expiry of his offered HTLC before he goes on-chain with
his Commitment and HTLC-timeout transactions. Therefore, the nLocktime
field has no impact on Bob's actions regarding HTLCs offered to Alice.
Second, for HTLCs offered by Alice (that is, payments sent by Alice), the
WF protocol does not force Bob to put his Commitment and associated
HTLC-success transactions on-chain before any specific time in order
guarantee the success of any HTLCs. As a result, Bob's ability to force
payment for HTLCs offered by Alice is unaffected by the nLocktime field in
his Commitment transactions. Note that the Lightning protocol does
require Bob to put his Commitment and associated HTLC-success transactions
on-chain by a specific time, which is why the changes described here
cannot be made to the Lightning protocol to support one-shot receives.

Getting A Payment Receipt
=========================

Consider again the case where casual user Alice has offered an HTLC to
Bob. At any time after the expiry of the HTLC, if Alice needs to get a
payment receipt and Bob is uncooperative, Alice can put her Commitment
transaction on-chain and then attempt to spend the HTLC output of her
Commitment transaction tsdB later. As was shown above, she is guaranteed
to win the race in putting her Commitment transaction on-chain due to the
nLocktime field in Bob's Commitment transaction. Therefore, she will
either get her receipt before she is able to spend the HTLC output or she
will not have to make her payment (because she succeeded in spending the
HTLC output). This procedure for getting a payment receipt isn't one-shot
and may be awkward for casual users. Fortunately, it's only required when
there's both a payment dispute (or other need to get a receipt quickly)
and an uncooperative channel partner.

Asynchronous Payments
=====================

The WF protocol gives significant flexibility to when CLUs have to be
online, but it still requires that the sender and receiver are both online
simultaneously. This requirement can be eliminated by keeping the relative
delay but removing the absolute delay in Alice's transaction that times
out an HTLC for a payment that she initiates. The details are given in the
paper [5].

Related Work
============

The protocol presented here is based extensively on previously-published
work, namely the Poon-Dryja Lightning channel protocol [1] and the BOLT
specifications [2]. The asynchronous payments protocol is based on
Corallo's proposal for sending tips to an offline receiver [3], but
differs by using only a relative delay in the sender's HTLC.

The idea of eliminating watchtowers for a casual user by delaying their
partner's ability to put transactions on-chain was described by Law [4],
but the interaction of that delay with HTLCs was not analyzed and that
paper assumed modifications to the underlying Bitcoin protocol.

Conclusions
===========

This post presents the idea of dividing users into Casual-Lightning-Users
(CLUs) that only send and receive payments, and Dedicated-Lightning-Users
(DLUs) that can also route payments. It gives a new protocol that allows
casual users to send and receive Lightning payments in a trust-free manner
without requiring a watchtower service. It also allows CLUs to receive
payments in a one-shot manner (that is, without having to wait for blocks
to be added to the blockchain). No changes to the Bitcoin protocol are
required.

The new protocol does have some disadvantages, such as increasing the cost
of capital for DLUs that partner with CLUs and increasing the latency for
CLUs to get payment receipts from uncooperative partners. Hopefully, the
elimination of watchtowers for casual users, and their ability to do
one-shot receives, will more than make up for these drawbacks.

I'm not an expert in the area, so I might have missed something.

Corrections and comments are greatly appreciated.

John
