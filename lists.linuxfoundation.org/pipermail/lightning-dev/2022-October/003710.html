<PRE>Subject: Forwardable Peerswaps

Introduction
============

[Peerswap](<A HREF="https://peerswap.dev">https://peerswap.dev</A>) is a protocol for swapping onchain funds
and offchain in-Lightning funds.
The intent of this protocol is to allow managing the inbound and outbound
capacities of your node without having to perform rebalancing.

Rebalancing is arguably a parasitic behavior, preying on low-fee channels
to buy out their available capacity, then turning around to resell the
purchased capacity at a higher fee.
By using swap services instead, a node manager can adjust capacity and
effectively add capacity to the network in the needed direction, without
pushing their own lack of capacity to a victim.

However, a limitation of peerswap is in its name: a peerswap is performed
with *only* a direct peer with which you have a channel.

This writeup then proposes an extension to the overall peerswap protocol
to work around this limitation, which I call &quot;forwardable peerswap&quot;.

I would like to make the claim that forwardable peerswaps solves the
problems that the following previous proposed and deployed solutions
attempt to fix:

* Liquidity markets (liquidity ads, Lightning Pool, etc.)
* Flow control valves (fee-based flow control / passive rebalancing,
  `htlc_maximum_msat`, etc.)

An important part of forwardable peerswaps is that it &quot;hides&quot; a
network-health-improving operation in a &quot;channel top-up&quot; operation
(i.e.  moving onchain funds to Lightning) that net senders will want to
do anyway (or else they stop being net senders).

Swaps vs. Splices
=================

A peerswap and a splice are very similar, in that they change the state
of one of our local channels, adding or removing outbound capacity on
that channel.

However:

* A swap will always take 2 onchain transactions:
  * An offer transaction that has an HTLC output.
  * A claim transaction that spends the above HTLC output.
    This spend can take up more space, requiring a SCRIPT revelation,
    a signature, and a preimage revelation.
* If designed to limit onchain footprint, a splice can take just one
  onchain transaction.
  * This spend will take only a SCRIPT revelation and two signatures,
    or with Taproot can be reduced to a single signature without any
    SCRIPT/Tapscript revelation.

Thus, a swap takes more onchain resources than a splice, and if we are
considering the state of a *single* channel alone, then a splice is
definitely more efficient.

However, if a swap extends beyond one hop, then the number of channels
affected by the swap is increased.
And yet, no matter how many channels are affected, the swap will
still take only two transactions.
Thus, swapping will exceed the efficiency of splicing once three or
more hops are considered.

The problem here is that, as indicated by its name, a peerswap is
limited to affecting only one channel, a channel between ourselves and
one of our direct peers.

Now, this limitation of peerswap is not without its justification:

* A multi-hop payment is inherently less reliable, as it requires
  multiple nodes to be continuously online at the same time.
* Intermediate LN nodes might not want the change in channel state
  (i.e. the multi-hop payment might worsen their channel balance).
* Offchain-to-onchain swaps impose an economic risk on the acceptor
  of the swap, which a peerswap can punish by closing the direct
  channel but which a remote swap cannot punish.

Peerswap User Story
===================

Suppose we have a small network of nodes A, B, and C, initially
with channels perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Suppose however that after some time, A notices that its channel
to B has little outbound capacity.

A can then propose a peerswap between A and B: A offers some
onchain funds in order to change the state in their channel,
getting more outbound capacity from A.

Suppose B accepts this and completes the peerswap protocol.

Now B is in possession of some onchain funds.
B then notices that its channel to C has little outbound capacity.

B can then propose a peerswap between B and C: B offers some
onchain funds in order to change the state in their channel,
getting more outbound capacity from B.

Suppose C accepts this and completes the peerswap protocol.

Now what happens in sum total on the blockchain layer?
We will see two swaps, each with 2 transactions, for a total of
4 transactions onchain.

Forwardable Peerswap
====================

To improve this, suppose we change the above user story, starting
at this point:

A can then propose a peerswap between A and B: A offers some
onchain funds in order to change the state in their channel,
getting more outbound capacity from A.

Suppose B then looks up its channels.
B then notices that its channel to C has little outbound capacity.

B can then propose a peerswap between B and C: B offers some
onchain funds in order to change the state in their channel,
getting more outbound capacity from B.
However, B is really going to act as little more than a message
translator between A and C, forwarding peerswap messages from A
to C and replies from C to A.

Thus, A thinks it is talking to B, but really it is negotiating
the peerswap with C, using B as a medium.
And vice versa, C thinkgs it is talking to B, but really it is
negotiating the peerswap with A, using B as a medium.

Further, C itself could end up forwarding the peerswap to yet
another node, which itself could forward the peerswap, etc.

Yet no matter how many hops the peerswap ends up getting
forwarded, there will only be two transactions onchain: one to
instantiate the onchain HTLC, another to claim it.

The overall changes are:

* A should initially offer an onchain HTLC with a longer then
  expected timeout, so that B (and C, D, etc.) has an
  opportunity to consider forwarding the peerswap.
* B should demand a longer in-Lightning HTLC timeout than what
  A demands from it (and so on for C, D, etc.).

What Peerswaps Are Forwardable?
-------------------------------

Let us be absolutely clear that there are actually two
sub-protocols of peerswap:

* Onchain-to-offchain: An initiator offers onchain funds to
  get more outbound capacity.
  * Net senders want to do this.
* Offchain-to-onchain: An initiator offers offchain funds to
  get onchain funds and more inbound capacity.
  * Net receivers want to do this.

Unfortunately, only the first sub-protocol (onchain-to-offchain)
is actually forwardable.

This is because, in the latter case, the initiator can force
the acceptor to waste resources, by aborting the protocol after
the acceptor has committed onchain funds to the HTLC.
Lightning HTLCs are trivially cancellable, but onchain HTLCs
can only be returned by waiting out the timeout and spending
onchain fees to recover the funds.

In a peerswap, the latter case is fixed by closing the channel
with the initiator, thus punishing them for aborting the protocol.
However, this punishment cannot be done in the forwarded case
without massive channel closures, which turns this into an
attack on the network.

Thus, forwardable peerswaps can only be of the onchain-to-offchain
type that are initiated by net senders.

Now you might wonder, how about net receivers, how would they
initiate forwardable peerswaps?
As I will demonstrate in a much later section, any
onchain-to-offchain forwardable peerswaps initiated by net
senders will make their way to some net receiver, and thus
net receivers need only wait and they will naturally get some
kind of forwardable onchain-to-offchain peerswap that will
also get them inbound capacity.

Future innovations (beyond the scope of this writeup, that is
what &quot;future&quot; means) may allow us to develop an offchain-to-onchain
remote swap that can effectively punish the initiator if it
does not complete the swap.
This would allow offchain-to-onchain peerswaps to also be
forwardable, which can only be beneficial to the network.
This may be hopium, however.
Nevertheless, even just forwardable onchain-to-offchain
peerswaps are still beneficial, as we shall see in succeeding
sections.

Advantages Of Forwardable Peerswap
==================================

Compared to the current peerswap:

* A forwardable peerswap can affect more than just one channel,
  improving the blockchain space utilization.

Compared to multi-hop swaps:

* Each node has the opportunity to decide whether to forward
  the peerswap or not, depending on the states of its other
  channels.
  If none of its other channels have a state that would be
  improved by forwarding the peerswap, the node can end the
  peerswap forwarding at itself and just accept the onchain
  funds.
* There is still the issue of multiple nodes having to
  coordinate in order to finish the forwarding and complete
  the protocol.
  Hopefully, for nodes used often on the public network,
  uptime should be high, and nodes can monitor peer uptime
  and use this information to decide whether to forward a
  peerswap to a particular peer or not.

In particular, we can also compare forwardable peerswaps to
standard forwardable payments on Lightning:

* Forwardable payments are source routed for privacy of the
  payer (and some minor privacy of the payee).
  * Due to the source not having access to the private
    information of intermediate nodes, it cannot know if the
    intermediate nodes would like the change in capacity, or
    if the intermediate nodes even *have* the correct capacity.
* Forwardable peerswaps are effectively packet-routed, with
  each node deciding where exactly to forward (or to not forward)
  each peerswap.
  * Each node has perfect information on which of its channels
    would appreciate the change in capacity, and also perfect
    information on which of its peers is online right now, who
    has high uptime, etc.

Fees And Incentives For Individual Nodes: Why Net Receivers Still Benefit
=========================================================================

A node forwarding a peerswap should not charge a fee for
the forward.
Any fee that the peerswap initiator may offer should be
paid, in full, to the ultimate acceptor of the forwarded
peerswap.

Consider a node that forwards an incoming peerswap request,
instead of accepting it itself.
That node:

* Gets *two* of their channels balanced better.
* Does not have to perform any onchain activity.

In short, it gets a free rebalance.

That is enough incentive, as the intermediate node can
expect more future income from having two channels
with improved balance, and does not have to spend anything
on onchain activity.

The forwarding node will, if it is rational, forward it
over a channel that lacks outgoing capacity.
This translates to forwarding it to a next hop that has
low incoming capacity.

If there are net senders and net receivers in the network,
then the senders will deplete their on-Lightning funds on
all their channels.

If a net sender depletes their on-Lightning funds:

* If the net sender can no longer acquire funds, they
  stop being a net sender and we can ignore them.
* If the net sender can acquire funds and get them on
  Lightning, they stop being a net sender and end up
  being neutral to the network, since the funds they
  can send out must be less than or equal to the funds
  they receive.
  They stop being a net sender and we can ignore them.
* If the net sender can acquire funds and get them
  onchain, they can use the onchain funds ot initiate
  onchain-to-offchain peerswaps.

If *all* net senders have depleted their funds and
can no longer get funds from either Lightning or
onchain (i.e. nobody starts a forwardable peerswap),
then net receivers will not receive more funds anymore
anyway (nobody is getting more funds to send) and the
fact that they have insufficient inbound capacity is
immaterial, so the fact that they cannot initiate a
forwardable peerswap is not a problem.

Now let us focus on a net receiver.
A net receiver is one where the payment flows are, in
sum, towards them.
This implies that, without further channel creations,
the inbound capacity they have will be depleted.
This also implies that they have much too large
outbound capacity, due to how channels work.
A net receiver is therefore a node with too much outbound
capacity.

Suppose net sender uses a peerswap that can be
forwarded.
Then its direct peer has an incentive to look at its
other channels to forward the peerswap to, so that it
gets two channels rebalanced for free without having
to be responsible for an onchain UTXO.

Now, suppose the forwardable peerswap reaches a node
who finds that it cannot forward the onchain-to-offchain
peerswap anymore.
This would occur if the node has too much outbound
capacity, and cannot add more outbound capacity with
its peers.

Now recall that a node with too much outbound capacity
is a node that has too little inbound capacity.
And a node with too little inbound capacity is a net
receiver.

Thus, forwardable peerswaps will start at net senders
and will be naturally pathed to terminate at net
receivers.
This is the advantage of forwardable peerswaps being
packet-switched instead of source-routed.

(Yes, problems and other things can occur along the
way and the real world and so on, but considered
in an ideal world, forwardable onchain-to-offchain
peerswaps will naturally path from net senders to
net receivers.)

Comparison To &quot;Just Make A Channel&quot;
===================================

Suppose a net sender just looks at it history of
payments and makes a direct channel to a node that it
usually pays to anyway, using its cold-storaged onchain
UTXO to fund the new channel.

This heuristic would probably work, but note that
just because a net sender is paying a node, does not
mean that *that* node is itself a net receiver!

Merchants have to pay:

* Suppliers of raw materials.
* Employees.
* Shareholders and owners of the business.

In a future where everyone gets paid over Lightning,
it is likely that merchants you pay to may themselves
not even be net receivers of money over Lightning.

In that case, the &quot;just make a channel&quot; technique will
cause capital to be locked inefficiently, since the
merchant that the net sender is paying is not really a
net receiver, and the added capacity towards them would
be underutilized.

A forwardable peerswap, because of the incentive of each
individual hop, will eventually locate the *actual*
net receivers and thus forward the needed capacity
adjustments to those receivers, even if the net sender
does not know who the *real* net receivers on the network
are.

Thus, forwardable peerswaps will allocate capital more
efficiently, simply by following the incentives of each
individual public routing node.

Further, if the net sender regularly uses unpublished
channels, then the capacity they add to the merchant
they usually pay is not even utilizable by the rest
of the network.
However, if a forwardable peerswap is used, even if
it starts at an unpublished channel, it can be routed
out over the public network and thus have the capacity
utilized by the rest of the public network.

If the net receivers of the network are *also* using
unpublished channels, then the forwardable peerswap
can also still reach them, since their direct peer
still knows about them and can decide to forward the
peerswap to them.
Thus, forwardable peerswaps can adapt to a world where
unpublished channels have not been delere sufficiently.

On Liquidity Markets
--------------------

There are various liquidity markets already deployed
or being developed.

These liquidity markets are intended to make the
&quot;Just Make A Channel&quot; strategy be guided better, by
having net receivers somehow directly contact net
senders so they can make direct channels and get
the needed capacity.

However, this often means that additional information
must be broadcast and/or additional resources kept
in reserve.

* With e.g. Lightning Pool, net receivers must provide
  their contact information and inbound capacity needs
  to a centralized server, which can be attacked or
  taken over to filter out particular, identified net
  receivers (i.e. censorship).
* With e.g. liquidity ads, there is no central server,
  but all forwarding nodes have to broadcast their
  liquidity ads, and all forwarding nodes have to keep
  some funds in onchain reserve, in case a new net
  receiver wants to buy liquidity from them.

Finally, liquidity markets are often targeted at getting
net receivers in touch with forwarding nodes.
But ideally, forwarding nodes have an almost net zero
flow on the network, and what needs to really be matched
up are net senders to net receivers.
Presumably forwarding nodes that participate in liquidity
markets are hoping that net senders will randomly build
channels to them, but that is not assured and a net
receiver that matches up with a forwarding node may find
that the forwarding node has actually oversold its inbound
capacity.
What needs to *actually* be done is match up net receivers
to net senders.

In contrast:

* In forwardable peerswaps, nobody knows who the
  net receivers are.
  A direct peer of a net receiver might forward a
  peerswap to them, but if the net receiver has
  other channels, that peer cannot be sure it
  terminates to them or is further forwarded.
  Thus, not even direct peers of a net receiver
  can learn that they *are* a net receiver.
* Even if a direct peer of the net receiver somehow
  knows them for a net receiver, they have
  disincentive to &quot;filter out&quot; the net receiver: they
  would not earn fees from the channel with the net
  receiver.
  If they wanted to impede the net receiver from
  being paid, they should have just closed the
  channel with them instead of maintaining it.
  But the net receiver can then go connect to
  some other node that still supports forwardable
  peerswaps, because decentralization, and thus
  cannot be censored without a network split.
* Purely forwarding nodes never need to maintain
  any onchain funds --- they will just forward
  peerswaps through them and gain the benefit of
  having two channels better balanced without
  having to touch onchain funds.
  This is unlike liquidity ads, which requires
  that liquidity ad-broadcasting forwarding
  nodes keep a stock of onchain funds to service
  dual-funding requests.
  This lets forwarding nodes maximize their
  on-Lightning funds for more earnings, without
  having to speculatively reserve some funds
  onchain, as in the liquidity ads case.
* Forwardable peerswaps, due to being packet-switched,
  will naturally gravitate from net senders to net
  receivers, with almost-net-zero forwarding nodes
  naturally pathing them from the former to the
  latter.
  This effectively forms a matchmaking between them.
  While forwarding nodes want to be mildly net
  receivers, the expected earnings are tiny and
  it would be likely a long time before their inbound
  capacity is depleted, and if so, they can then
  terminate a received forwardable peerswap at
  themselves, just like any other net receiver.

Comparison to &quot;Rebalance Rebalance Rebalance&quot;
=============================================

Currently, forwarding nodes manage their balances via
rebalancing, i.e. making a self-payment, from a channel
with high outgoing capacity to a channel with low
outgoing capacity.

Because the fees they earn on Lightning are very small,
such forwarding nodes will select rebalancing routes with
low fees, and will have strict budgets on how much they
are willing to spend on rebalancing.

What then happens is that random altruists who set their
fees to very low, or even zero, will find that forwarding
nodes will keep rebalancing via their channels.
As multiple forwarding nodes vie for the limited amount of
capacity on such low-fee channels, by the time an actual
economic-activity non-rebalancing payment reaches one of
those altruist nodes, the available balance towards
net receivers has been depleted, having been transferred
to rebalancing forwarders, leading to payment failure and
longer payment settlement times.

Thus, rebalancing forwarders who want to turn a profit,
end up (deliberately or not) exploiting altruists who
are setting their fees too low.

(Though since altruists will often say that they are doing
this &quot;to help the network&quot;, we should note that the
profiteering forwarding nodes *are* component parts of the
network, so the altruists have in fact achieved their stated
goal.
It would be different if the actual goal was &quot;to help
payers pay cheaply&quot;, which is not achieved.)

Now consider a world where forwardable peerswaps is
widely deployed on the network, and widely initiated by
net senders to top up their channels.

In that world, if a forwarding node receives a forwardable
peerswap, they can rebalance two of their channels favorably
without spending anything.

A self-paying rebalance would still need to pay out fees.
Even if a rebalancer is exploiting a zero-fee-routing
node, it is likely that one or more of the nodes between
it and the exploited altruist will charge a non-zero fee.
Thus, there will still be a cost to a self-paying rebalance.
In contrast, accepting and forwarding a forwardable peerswap
would gain the same benefit as a successful rebalance (fix
the balance of two channels), but at zero cost to the
forwarder.

A self-paying rebalance does have the advantage that it
can be performed at any time, whereas forwarding a
forwardable peerswap requires waiting for an opportunity
to do so.
But if forwardable peerswaps are widely deployed on the
network and happen often enough, then it may be sufficient
that forwarders find that active self-paying rebalancing
is no longer sufficiently advantageous, and that behavior
is therefore suppressed.

This should then lead to a world where the exploitation
of those altruists charging low fees for their capacity is
greatly reduced, since active self-paying rebalancing is
no longer particularly needed by profiteering forwarding
nodes.

Comparison To &quot;Flow Valves&quot;
===========================

Due to channel depletion causing payment delays, there
are proposals for some kind of &quot;flow valve&quot; to modulate
payment flows on the Lightning Network.

* Fee-based valves broadcast feerates to signal how much
  outbound capacity is in a particular direction, to
  entice users to the channel via low fees, or drive
  away users (and reduce flow) via high fees.
* `htlc_maximum_msat` valves broadcast changes to
  that advertised parameter to change how much payment
  flow goes through a channel.
  * This is unfortunately broken as users can split
    their payments (or self-paying rebalances, for that
    matter) to below the `htlc_maximum_msat`, and thus
    get around the flow valve.
    This can be fixed by using a sufficiently high
    non-zero base fee, but that is arguably switching
    over to a fee-based flow valve.

In both cases, flow valves not only have to be
widely broadcast across the network (increasing
bandwidth consumption) but it also leaks information
about the capacity of channels of the forwarding nodes,
and thus indirectly leaks information about who net
senders and net receivers are (by observing which flow
valves are the more limiting).

But more importantly, flow valves increase the friction
of using Lightning Network.
If the friction is high enough, users will switch to
another payment network.

Rather than install flow valves (which would slow down
LN payment velocity) we just make forwardable peerswaps
as a pressure release valve, releasing pent-up
pressure-to-pay by diverting it on a swap over the base
Bitcoin blockchain.

This effectively admits that we *do* need to switch
over to another payment network once Lightning starts
getting overloaded.
Basically, a forwardable peerswap is a payment, from
some net sender to some net receiver, over the
Bitcoin blockchain (i.e. the &quot;another payment network&quot;)
rather than over Lightning.

However:

* A net sender may be matched up to an arbitary net
  receiver that is physically nearby on the Lightning
  Network, but which the net sender does not, in fact,
  have direct economic ties with.
  Thus, onchain surveillors cannot derive any information
  from this onchain payment, other than &quot;looks like the
  Lightning Network is busy today&quot;.
* A succesful forwardable peerswap is a pressure release
  valve, which resets the state of multiple channels on
  the network, from net senders to net receivers, and
  thus enabling further payment flows involving them
  and their neighborhood.
  There is thus no need for a flow valve.
* There is no need to broadcast anything, and forwarding
  nodes do not need to leak their channel balances over
  the gossip network.
* Users are already conditioned to accept that onchain
  activity is costly, but have been convinced that
  Lightning is cheaper and faster.
  If flow valves are used, they may cause Lightning to
  work slower and more expensively, thus breaking that
  expectation.
  But if forwardable peerswap is used instead, users
  who use onchain funds to &quot;top up&quot; their channel end
  up initiating a forwardable peerswap that keeps the
  rest of the network cheap and fast, while accepting
  that the onchain activity involved in this will be
  costly and slow since that is what onchain activity
  inherently is.
