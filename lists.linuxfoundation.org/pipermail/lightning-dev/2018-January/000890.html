<PRE>What you are saying makes perfect sense for the short term.

What I am talking about could promote a big picture healthier network 
long term by discouraging &quot;super nodes&quot; in the network from existing, if 
you avoid making connections to nodes that have large channel capacities 
with other parties.

Does this make sense?
