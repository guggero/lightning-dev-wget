<PRE>Good morning Matt,

&gt;<i> I can't imagine the constants add up that fast... Allow 25 channels per peer and limit your peers reasonably and the cost should be low enough. Really not sure why something like a 25 channel limit should limit any usage or reasonably burden a node, what am I missing?
</I>
You impose this 25 channels per peer.  I start opening a channel to you.  Because I did not check mempool or because my fee-estimation algo is bad, I pay too low a fee.  I become impatient and bump it up, which you perceive as another open (so it is now 2/25 channels).  Unfortunately I only bumped my fee by a tiny amount, because reasons.  I bump the fees upwards for example five more times, each of which you perceive as another channel open, so from your side it looks like I am consuming 7/25 channels.  Finally the funding transaction confirms, but the 6 previous transactions are perceived by you as unconfirmed channel opens, so you will still keep the 6 channels accounted in your 25-channel-limit.

Suppose in a few days (i.e. much less than a week) I decide to have three more channels to you.  If I go through all that (starting with low fee, bumping up fee, etc) then I may very well run out of the available 25 channels to you, even though I only really have 1 channel already opened and am trying to make an additional 3 channels only.

Granted this is somewhat contrived, but it shows what I wish to avoid with `funding_cancelled`.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
