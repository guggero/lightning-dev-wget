&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> I have mentioned this to roasbeef re: lnd implementing it... but I am
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if this idea has propagated through the LN community and whether
</I>&gt;<i> other wallets are going to implement it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feature:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the recipient of a payment waiting for a specific r_hash receives
</I>&gt;<i> an open_channel message with push_msat &gt;= the value of the request where
</I>&gt;<i> the temporary_channel_id contains the r_hash... that payment will be set to
</I>&gt;<i> a WAITING_OPEN status.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once the channel is open, the payment moves to a PAID status.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If while waiting for channel to open in the WAITING_OPEN state, a routed
</I>&gt;<i> payment is received with the r_hash, accept that payment and change the
</I>&gt;<i> payment status to PAID.
</I>
Hi Jonathan,

        It's an interesting idea, but I think I prefer simply opening a
channel then making a payment rather than using push_msat.  Otherwise
the payer doesn't get proof of payment for this case.

&gt;<i> 1. Open_channel can take up to 10 minutes, but most smartphone apps kill
</I>&gt;<i> background network processes for apps after 5 minutes or so.
</I>
Worse, open_channel can take *hours* if the depth requirement is high,
the fees too low, or miners unlucky.

&gt;<i> 2. If routing fails to pay someone. A wallet UI should ask the user:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You have enough on-chain funds to send. What would you like to do?
</I>&gt;<i>   1. Open channel &amp; send
</I>&gt;<i>   2. Send on-chain
</I>&gt;<i>   3. Give up&quot;
</I>
Generally it's better to open a channel, though sending onchain is
possible if they provided a fallback address.

&gt;<i> 3. If we choose 1 in the current implementations, we would need to open a
</I>&gt;<i> channel, then wait... then remember to re-open the app as soon as the
</I>&gt;<i> channel is open. Then we need to paste the payment request again.
</I>
I'm sure there are ways for mobile wallets do the kind of polling needed
here, and respond accordingly.  They can certainly disconnect in the
meantime.

&gt;<i> 4. By allowing the person to &quot;pay&quot; with an open_channel, it allows people
</I>&gt;<i> to signal intent to pay... allowing payment processors that generate
</I>&gt;<i> payment requests with short expiration times to react to that intent
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>
It introduces trust into the system though; either you're prepared to
offer longer settlement terms, or you aren't.  I don't think you should
adjust based on such a falsifiable signal?

&gt;<i> I think this might be good to add into BOLT 2... what does everyone
</I>&gt;<i> think?....... not sure.
</I>
FWIW, this would be a 1.1 thing, since spec is frozen other than
outright bugs.

Thanks!
Rusty.
