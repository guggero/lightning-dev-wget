I'm failing to see why I'd care about a remote channel's capacity, aside
from it being large enough to cover the amount I want to transfer. As a
participant routing through a channel that has a higher capacity I do
not incur any additional risk than from a smaller channel, since the
payment is guaranteed to be atomic. In the contrary one could argue that
a higher capacity channel has a higher probability of having sufficient
capacity in the desired direction to forward my transfer.

Maybe I'm failing to see something? I always interpreted the limit as
purely self-defense on how much value I'm confident enough to keep in a
channel.

Cheers,
Christian
