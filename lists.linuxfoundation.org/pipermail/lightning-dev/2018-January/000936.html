Hi Benjamin!

        Weird, I always find them kinda useless.  RFC2119 pretty much
covers it.

&gt;<i> When a BOLT says that a lightning node MUST do some X, what does that mean
</I>&gt;<i> exactly? I'm thinking it means we should stigmatize it as &quot;non-compliant&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> with protocol consensus as documented in BOLTs, whenever we discuss the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation. I think violation of a MUST should be considered hostile. I
</I>&gt;<i> think a MUST encourages nodes to fail a channel or connection upon
</I>&gt;<i> observing a violation of that MUST, and even to take
</I>&gt;<i> implementation-specific defensive measures as deemed appropriate by
</I>&gt;<i> implementers (so long as they have cryptographic evidence that the
</I>&gt;<i> violation is not forged). But in no way does a MUST assure implementers
</I>&gt;<i> that they may assume this MUST will be respected by remote nodes, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> not the purpose of MUST to convey that cryptographic safeguards or such
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere in the protocol design have arranged to force adherence..
</I>
This is why we attempt to divide requirements into sender and receiver.
For example, this is an absolute unchangable protocol requirement:

        Sender MUST set X.
        Receiver MUST close channel if X is not set.

or:
        Sender MUST set X.
        If X is set, Receiver MUST ...

The latter implies that future versions of the spec may have senders not
setting X.

I thought about writing a BOLT on how to write BOLTs, but it would
doubtless come across as inane navel-gazing.

Note also that the spec does not live up to this property in all places,
but we bugfix where we find that.

Cheers,
Rusty.
