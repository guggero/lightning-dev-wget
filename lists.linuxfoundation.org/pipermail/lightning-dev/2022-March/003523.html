<PRE>Good morning everyone,

with regards to zerobasefee, I think that the argument that HTLCs are
costly doesn't quite hold up because they are always free to an
attacker as it stands. However, I fully agree with Zmn's opinion that
it's not necessary to bang our head against any opposition to this
because we can simply follow his excellent method for overweighing
base fee. I believe this is a very natural approach to let the market
decide on the relative importance of optimized routing vs base fees.

As to Martin's approximation research, I have asked myself similar
questions. Unfortunately, the paper you cite is paywalled and not
available at sci-hub, so I haven't read it. FWIW, I believe I have a
simple proof that minimum cost flow preserves approximation FACTORS:

Let O be the original problem and A the approximated problem such that
every flow in O can be mapped 1:1 to a flow in A and vice versa. Let
every edge e in O be represented by a set of edges in A whose total
cost is within a factor (1+epsilon) for every possible flow (could be
over- or underestimating). Note that this means that every flow in O
has cost within a factor (1+epsilon) for the corresponding flow in A
and vice versa.

Now let f_a be the min cost flow in A and f_o the min cost flow in O.
Assume that c(f_o)(1+epsilon)&lt;c(f_a). Then f_o corresponds to a flow
in A that is cheaper than f_a, but that's impossible because f_a is
the min cost flow.
QED.

Problems might arise anyway because we represent probabilities only
logarithmically in the cost, so that a factor of (1+epsilon)
corresponds to an exponent (1+epsilon) for the probabilities. But Ren&#233;
seems optimistic that the resulting flows look good enough in
practice.

I am still optimistic that exact solvers with something like the cost
scaling approach might also be feasible (as long as they produce
integer flows), but I am happy that this simple approximation approach
seems good enough. This should save us a lot of work because there are
many linear min cost solvers available that represent years of
cumulative work in optimization research.

Cheers
  Stefan

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Carsten, Rene and fellow lightning developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the approximation quality of the minimum convex cost flow formulation for multi-part payments on the lightning network [1] and Carsten's discussion points on Twitter [2] and on the mailing list:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8) Quality of Approximation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are some problems in computer science that are hard/impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approximate, in the sense that any kind of deviation from the optimum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could cause the computed results to be extremely bad. Do you have some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea (or proof) that your kind of approximation isn't causing a major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue? I guess a piece-wise linearization with an infinite number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pieces corresponds to the optimal result. Given a finite number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pieces, how large is the difference to the optimum?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did some literature research and came across an insightful paper [3] by Dorit Hochbaum from 1993, that proves proximity results for integer and continuous optimal solutions of the minimum convex cost flow as well as proximity results of the optimal solutions for a piecewise linear approximation and the original problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Admittedly theoretical results, however, it further underpins that a piecewise linear approximation is a reasonable approach to find optimal flows and even shows that searching for optimal solutions on the continuous domain (e.g. with descent methods from convex optimization) also gives near-optimal solutions on the integer domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
