<PRE>Hello list,

After some months working on this, today I'm releasing the alpha for
rust-teos, the rust version of The Eye of Satoshi (a lightning watchtower).

The project is a port of the original Python's codebase I was working on
last year, with an improved design, way less boilerplate code, and improved
performance. This is partly thanks to Rust itself, but also to LDK. The
older codebase was built on top of Core, while the new one leverages some
of the heavy lifting to the dev kit.

The current functionality is at a similar stage (if not the same) where the
Python's codebase was left. An HTTP API is offered for the interaction with
the user and the tower, and the internal interface is built using gRPC. The
code also includes a CLI for the tower admin to interact with the backend.
Currently there's no client for this, the old c-lightning's watchtower
plugin needs to be updated to work with the new tower, which I'll be
working on next, so if you were using the old tower do not switch yet!

The codebase will benefit from some additional reviews, as well as some
contributors. Hi you, dev looking for a FOSS project to contribute to :D.

In any case, if anyone is interested in giving it a look, the code can be
found at: <A HREF="https://github.com/talaia-labs/rust-teos">https://github.com/talaia-labs/rust-teos</A> (there's also an
architecture diagram at <A HREF="https://github.com/talaia-labs/rust-teos/issues/30">https://github.com/talaia-labs/rust-teos/issues/30</A>).

Best,
-- 
Sergi Delgado.
