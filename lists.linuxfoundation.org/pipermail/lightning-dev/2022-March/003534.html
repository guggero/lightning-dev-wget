<PRE>Good morning,

Things that affect privacy particularly when large sums of money are involved in bitcoin:

Liquidity, Anonymity set, Amounts, Type of addresses/scripts, Block, Locktime and Version

I have left out things that aren't part of bitcoin protocol or blockchain like KYC. It is difficult for users to move large sums of BTC without being observed because bitcoin does not have confidential transactions to hide amounts. Coinjoin implementations have their own issues, trade-offs, some might even censor transactions and big amounts will still be a problem. Coinswap might be an alternative in future however I wanted to share one solution that could be helpful in improving privacy.

Synonym did first [stablecoin transaction][1] in a lightning channel using Omni BOLT. Consider Alice starts a bitcoin project in which a lightning channel is used for assets like stablecoin. Bob wants to use 1000 BTC linked with an incident. He opens channels with Alice, gets stablecoin which can be used in any project that supports Omni BOLT assets.

Questions:

What is the lightning channel capacity when using Omni BOLT?

What else can be improved in this setup? Anything else that I maybe missing?

I added 'fifty shades of privacy' in subject because it was the first thing that came to my mind when I look at privacy in bitcoin and lightning.
