<PRE>Dear Carsten, Rene and fellow lightning developers,

Regarding the approximation quality of the minimum convex cost flow formulation for multi-part payments on the lightning network [1] and Carsten's discussion points on Twitter [2] and on the mailing list:

&gt;<i> 8) Quality of Approximation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some problems in computer science that are hard/impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> approximate, in the sense that any kind of deviation from the optimum
</I>&gt;<i> could cause the computed results to be extremely bad. Do you have some
</I>&gt;<i> idea (or proof) that your kind of approximation isn't causing a major
</I>&gt;<i> issue? I guess a piece-wise linearization with an infinite number of
</I>&gt;<i> pieces corresponds to the optimal result. Given a finite number of
</I>&gt;<i> pieces, how large is the difference to the optimum?
</I>
I did some literature research and came across an insightful paper [3] by Dorit Hochbaum from 1993, that proves proximity results for integer and continuous optimal solutions of the minimum convex cost flow as well as proximity results of the optimal solutions for a piecewise linear approximation and the original problem.

Admittedly theoretical results, however, it further underpins that a piecewise linear approximation is a reasonable approach to find optimal flows and even shows that searching for optimal solutions on the continuous domain (e.g. with descent methods from convex optimization) also gives near-optimal solutions on the integer domain.

Cheers,
Martin
