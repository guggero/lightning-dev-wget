<PRE>Also, using Miniscript (whether in Segwit v0 or v1) would prevent this kind of surprises. And many potential others. :-)

I'll post something soon about how we could integrate Miniscript in Lightning.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The offering counterparty spends the offered HTLC output with a HTLC-timeout transaction where the witness is &lt;&lt;remote_sig&gt; &lt;payment_preimage&gt;&gt;. SIGHASH_ALL is not committing to the spent Script branch intended to be used. As you raised, it doesn't alleviate the offering counterparty to respect the CLTV delay and as such the offered HTLC timespan cannot be shortened. The implication I can think of, in case of competing HTLC race, once the absolute timelock is expired, the offering counterparty is able to compete against the receiving one with a more feerate-efficient witness. However, from a receiving counterparty safety viewpoint, if you're already suffering a contest, it means your HTLC-claim on your own local commitment transaction inbound HTLC output has been inefficient, and your fee-bumping strategy is to blame.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we think the issue is relevant, I believe splitting the Script branches in two tapleaves and having bip342 signature digest committing to the tapleaf_hash solves it.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Offered HTLCs have three claim paths: the revocation case, the offerer claiming through the HTLC-timeout transaction, and the receiver claiming via their sig + preimage. The offering party can claim via the HTLC-timeout case on their commitment transaction with their signature and the remote's signature (SIGHASH_ALL) after the cltv_expiry timeout. Since the remote party gives them a signature, after the timeout, the offering party can claim with the remote's signature + preimage, but can only spend with the HTLC-timeout transaction because of SIGHASH_ALL. This assumes that the remote party doesn't claim it first. I can't think of any cases where the offering party would know the preimage AND want to force close, so that's why I think it's benign. It does make the witness smaller. The same trick isn't possible with the Received HTLC's due to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
