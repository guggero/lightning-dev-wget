Ah I see, yes, theres a lot of additional documentation needed. When
you have your head that deep into some topic for months, you assume
everyone looks at your notes and understands everything just
perfectly.

[...]

&gt;<i> At Commitment 20, the channel state is 0 BTC to Alice and 1 to Bob.
</I>&gt;<i> At commitment 31, the channel state is 1 BTC to Alice and 0 to Bob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice is the client and Bob is the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presume Alice deicdes to be a jerk! She broadcasts a mutated (re-signed)
</I>&gt;<i> version of Commitment 20. The server is out 1 BTC! This is now a hostage
</I>&gt;<i> negotiation.
</I>
But the 1 BTC of Commitment 20 goes straight to Bob (and not to a
multi-sig address). Mutating a channel transaction only hurts the
party that is doing the mutation. This is why RBF is a major problem,
if it ever gets deployed.


&gt;<i> Let's presume that you set up some kind of reserve requirement instead:
</I>&gt;<i> At Commitment 20, the channel state is 0.05 BTC to Alice and 0.95 to Bob.
</I>&gt;<i> At commitment 31, the channel state is 0.95 BTC to Alice and 0.05 to Bob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, Alice deicdes to be a jerk! She broadcasts a mutated (re-signed)
</I>&gt;<i> version of Commitment 20. The server is out 0.95 BTC! But wait, you say,
</I>&gt;<i> Alice might be out 0.05 of her own BTC. This model breaks down because
</I>&gt;<i> it's still a hostage scenario! Alice tells Bob, &quot;hey, I know I have 0.05
</I>&gt;<i> BTC stuck here (and you have 0.9 stuck), but I'm rich. I don't care how
</I>&gt;<i> long it takes, how about you give me a 'tax' of 0.1 BTC. You'll get your
</I>&gt;<i> money back... well most of it, just sign this transaction where I get
</I>&gt;<i> 0.15&quot;.
</I>
The same as above, if she resignes commitment 20, she is losing 0.05
BTC, while Bob does still get the 0.95 BTC.

There is a problem with channel histories, where Alice holds all the
funds at one point, and Bob holds all the funds at some later point,
as open payments are not as secure as those settled balances. I
mitigate this by setting a hard requirement on the spendable amount. I
will describe this in more detail soon.
