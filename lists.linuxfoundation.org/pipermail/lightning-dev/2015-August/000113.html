<PRE>Hey Joseph,

thank you very much for your invaluable feedback!

Can you elaborate, why you think that the client is not able to close
the channel? I think this is a misunderstanding on your side, which
most of the rest of your post argues from. While there is a slight
favor for the server in the channel design, there is nothing what
prevents the client from broadcasting (and enforcing) the channel.

I will of course respect your inquiry - if you really mean it after
that misunderstanding - and stop calling it a Lightning Network
implementation as long as it does not provide the complete no-trust.

I have thought a lot about RBF, and it is definitely a problem with
this implementation.

&gt;<i> Hi Mats,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting work on payment channels, I think a lot of the bitcoinj code
</I>&gt;<i> can be used for further development as the necessary bitcoin softforks
</I>&gt;<i> for LN are incorporated. A bitcoinj implementation for lightning would
</I>&gt;<i> be great!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already, it will be much more useful if those add these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionalities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some quick feedback (might have more later):
</I>&gt;<i> * I don't think a dual-Commitment structure is necessary if only one
</I>&gt;<i>   party can close out the channel. The purpose of having two Commitments
</I>&gt;<i>   is so that the payout structure is different. In this case, since only
</I>&gt;<i>   the server can broadcast the final balance (and the client has no way
</I>&gt;<i>   to close out the channel), only the B Commitment is necessary).
</I>&gt;<i> * HTLCs have significant malleability risks with malicious servers
</I>&gt;<i>   (hostage scenarios).
</I>&gt;<i> * If you presume full-RBF (which I think is a game-theoretic
</I>&gt;<i>   eventuality), clients can pay a higher fee to mutate the server's
</I>&gt;<i>   broadcast of the Commitment, which will result in the server's funds
</I>&gt;<i>   being held up permanently until the server is willing to negotiate
</I>&gt;<i>   (malleability hostage scenario).
</I>&gt;<i> * Exit Scamming is a distinct and likely possibility. The server can
</I>&gt;<i>   develop a good reputation for a while, then decide to screw over
</I>&gt;<i>   everyone. The server refuses to do any further transactions in any
</I>&gt;<i>   channel which has funds in the clients favor (current channel balance
</I>&gt;<i>   for the client is above what was funded). With the timeout, the server
</I>&gt;<i>   gets the original deposit back, which is above what they should get
</I>&gt;<i>   back, in other words, the server steals your money.
</I>&gt;<i> * This creates an asymmetric playing field. If one cannot be confident
</I>&gt;<i>   they will receive their funds back, this is similar to depositing your
</I>&gt;<i>   money on a hosted wallet such as Coinbase or whatever. The primary
</I>&gt;<i>   value of transacting on bitcoin is that the social costs of
</I>&gt;<i>   counterparty risks are minimized -- and counterparty risk is one of
</I>&gt;<i>   the primary inputs on interest rates (remove trust -&gt; remove
</I>&gt;<i>   counterparty risk -&gt; remove fees/interest). This can only exist if
</I>&gt;<i>   you're sufficiently willing to transact with nearly anyone (minimal
</I>&gt;<i>   underwriting).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, as there are less everyday payments on the blockchain,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is more space for important transactions of higher value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this is one of the primary values of payment channel based
</I>&gt;<i> systems. To extend and take your point in a different direction, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a risk if everyone uses blockchain transactions for every day
</I>&gt;<i> purchases, that high-value transactions will crowd out low-value
</I>&gt;<i> transactions. There is a tension that exists between the need for
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently high fees to pay miners (when the block rewards decline)
</I>&gt;<i> and allowing low-fee transactions to be on-chain in a timely manner.
