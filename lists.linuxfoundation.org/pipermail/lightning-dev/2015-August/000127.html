<PRE>Joseph asked, what changes OP_CLTV would bring to my Thunder proposal,
and I started working out, how much is actually possible with only
CLTV implemented.

It is still unclear, how CLTV and CSV are activated, and there are
discussions about adding them in one single softfork, rendering this
design useless of course. Nevertheless, maybe someone can find some
interest in it, I wasn't able to find it on the mailing list or in any
paper.

Excerpt from thunder.network:

Channel Design:

With OP_CLTV it is possible to replace the
payout-to-multisig-and-give-timelocked-partly-signed-transaction with
a simple OP-code, specifying for how long the output should not be
spent. With this it is able to completely mitigate all the
malleability problems we have in our current solution. Let&#8217;s take a
look into some of the changes made and their implications.

Opening Transaction

There are no longer refund transactions that needs to get
interchanged. It is possible to directly make the refund to both
parties part of the opening transaction. This completely removes any
risk problems and allows for large amount of funds within the channel.
As soon as the refund time has come, both parties can get their
respective funds back with just their sole private key. As we cannot
accomplish the exact distribution with just one output and CLTV, we
use two outputs that only differ in the refund private key. By doing
so, any channel transaction has to include both these outputs (and of
course both has to be signed accordingly), leading to (slightly)
larger transactions.

Channel Transaction

Settled Funds

We use the same mechanism as in the opening transaction here, and
added a multi-sig output to ensure that these funds are revocable. If
both parties agree on a new version of the channel, they release their
temporary signatures A2 and B2. If a party broadcasts a channel that
was marked as revoked, the other party can steal those funds.
Furthermore, malleability is no longer an issue, as refunds are only
timelocked using CLTV, and in case of a revoke, the other party has
both private keys. In any case, we are no longer depending on having a
specific transaction presigned by the other party.

Sending HTLC

Making a payment now consists of 3 outputs. We combine the mechanism
for refunds and for revocable transactions (see above) with the
ability of the receiver to claim the payments in case he knows the
secret R. We lowered the refund time to the general timeframe of a
payment, such that it is enforceable by the sender. Again, as we don&#8217;t
depend on presigned transactions, malleability is no longer an issue.

Receiving HTLC

The outputs of a receiving HTLC are very similar to those of a sending
one, but with the private keys set accordingly. Also the timeframe is
down to 6 days, such that we have plenty of time to determine if a
payment will get refunded or not.

Now there are a couple of problems with this design, mainly that HTLCs
are not strictly revocable. If one party broadcasts a revoked
transactions with HTLCs inside, the other party can just try to race
against the propagation of the claiming transactions, which will often
be fruitless. This goes for receiving payments, where the party can
claim the funds with the secret R and also for sending payments, where
he can use the refund option (for revoked channels which are older
than the refund timeout). This can however completely mitigated using
a simple reserve strategy (see below for details, it can be applied
for payments in both directions).

Additionally, this new channel design means that a channel will get
closed and broadcasted completely, as soon as the refund condition for
any payment in your channel is met. To counter this as a receiver of a
payment, you have to reveal the secret or settle a new channel without
the payment (manual refund) in time with the other party. As a sender,
you have to check back the payment before the refund, to work out with
the other party if the payment should refund or settle.

Those timeframes are just for illustration, it might be preferable to
play along with those numbers a bit. For example, the one day
difference between the sender and the receiver means that in extreme
cases the sender only has one day for updating his channel.
Furthermore, there isn&#8217;t really a reason the receiver has 6 days time
to reveal his secret, where 6 hours would be plenty of time as well.
Finally, we can also extend the period for a payment, resulting in a
longer lock-up time frame at the end of the channel.

With channels being strictly no-trust, we can move towards larger
amounts of funds inside the channels, mitigating the problem with
non-revocable HTLCs and the workaround. It just becomes one additional
rule we have to apply among all the others that are apparent already.

Implementing these changes in the current Thunder implementations is
trivial. It comes down to deleting a lot of methods currently
necessary and switching to the new scripts. This goes for most channel
design changes, as the design of Rusty for example.


Appendix: Payments in older Channel Versions

There is a problem, as settlement transactions are not time-encumbered
(we want that whoever deserves the output of a payment to be able to
claim it instantly, with no one possibly interfering). This means if
one party has a channel transaction with a payments towards it, he can
claim this payment under any circumstances. However, if this party
does broadcast a revoked channel to claim such an output, the
counterparty can still steal all settled funds and all funds towards
his channel.

It is therefore important to keep track of the amounts the other party
is receiving. We have to know, which is the highest amount the other
party ever had as receiving payments in his channel, and we must make
sure that we decline any attempts of him spending money, such that his
balance would drop below this amount.

This will be more clear using this example:

We start with a channel, with Alice and Bob, and both fund the mutual
channel with 10 BTC.

So at t=0 we are at

        Alice         -        10 BTC

        Bob         -        10 BTC

Now imagine that for some reason, Alice received payments, such that
she has 5 BTC as uncleared payments in her channel.

t=t1

        Alice         -          10  BTC ( +5 BTC uncleared )

        Bob         -          5    BTC

She reveals the secrets and Alice and Bob settle those payments, leading to

t=t2

        Alice         -          15  BTC

        Bob         -          5    BTC

Now if Alice were to be free to spend all her money, if we don&#8217;t
enforce the above rules, she could spend all her money (leading to
legitimate payment contracts in other channels that we are obliged
to).

t=t3

        Alice         -        0   BTC

        Bob        -        20 BTC

But, as reasoned above, payments towards Alice can always be claimed
by Alice, such that she can claim the 5 BTC from the t=t1 channel
transaction and Bob losing those 5 BTC. The t=t1 transaction does
spend 5 BTC directly towards Bob, and he can also claim the 10 BTC
settled balance from Alice, but his net balance compared to the t=t3
is -5 BTC.

To defend against this kind of attack, it is important to keep track
of the maximum the other party has as receiving uncleared payments in
his channel. In this case, the maximum Alice has as uncleared
receiving payments is at t=t1, 5 BTC. This means, we have to make sure
her balance does not drop below 5 BTC anymore. As agreeing on a
channel with a payment is a mutual action, Bob can just refuse to
accept a new channel transaction, where the balance of Alice would
drop below 5 BTC.

This rule also serves as an incentive to clear out receiving payments
as soon as possible. The party who has sent a payment (Carol in this
example) can only remove settle the payment after the receiving party
has cleared the payment, and we don&#8217;t want the channel to clog.
