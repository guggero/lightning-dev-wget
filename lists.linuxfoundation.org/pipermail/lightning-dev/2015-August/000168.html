Indeed.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think in this case we need to peel the onion[1]: if a payment takes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too long you tell the previous node where you sent it (and relay where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it sent it, etc.)  If you're the last in the queue, you also need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prove that you closed the channel to the offender[2] (which costs you a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> txfee, providing disincentive).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone see any other problems?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like the &quot;peeling the onion&quot; idea, since it breaks down a very

Me too.

&gt;<i> important privacy layer. This privacy is necessary e.g. to make sure the
</I>&gt;<i> network remains open for new participants to start routing, even against
</I>&gt;<i> the will of an existing cartel of routers.
</I>
Fortunately, I've abandoned it :)

My latest scheme simply requires you to return some valid unilateral
close transaction.  If you don't, I will close the channel to you, and
use that unilateral close to prevent my upstream from closing on me.

I think this has the right incentive; unilateral closes are painful in
locked funds, fees and opportunity cost.

We might need to get more sophisticated eventually, but I think it's
enough for now?

Thanks,
Rusty.
