</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this proposal, I suggest the addition of new types of signature schemes

</I>&gt;<i>         Such a hybrid would certainly be possible (though getting novel

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You refer to an &quot;order or magnitude&quot; increase in pubkey and signature

</I>&gt;<i> difference to the LN.  
</I>
The AEDSA signatures are around 6000 bits, give or take.  Due to the way
the algorithm works the signatures are not constant length (they have a
length distribution).  As a result we tend to talk about &quot;average
length&quot; of signatures.

&gt;<i> Giant pubkeys might be a logistical issue, though
</I>&gt;<i> using the bitcoin trick of referring to them via their RIPEMD160 should
</I>&gt;<i> work there, too.
</I>
The AEDSA public keys are 344 bits long and are constant length.  I'm
not sure if it's worth the time to perform a RIPEMD160 over 344 bits to
save 50%?  But only you could answer that.

Yet even with these sizes we're seeing a tremendous verification
performance increase over ECDSA (on the order of 100-300x improvement)
with a smaller code footprint and reduced RAM usage, even on tiny, 8-bit
platforms like an 8051 or 16-bit platforms like an MSP430.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
