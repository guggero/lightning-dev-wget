<PRE>Hi Mats,

Interesting work on payment channels, I think a lot of the bitcoinj code
can be used for further development as the necessary bitcoin softforks
for LN are incorporated. A bitcoinj implementation for lightning would
be great!

Can you do me a big favor and not call this an implementation for
Lightning Network, though? I would prefer some name like &quot;payment
channel networks&quot; or something similar, as it's materially different in
design and trust models. In particular, if exit scams occur, I don't
want it to be associated with Lightning Network.

Yeah, a lot of the code can definitely be used for a full LN
implementation when the opcodes come in for sure!

Some quick feedback (might have more later):
* I don't think a dual-Commitment structure is necessary if only one
  party can close out the channel. The purpose of having two Commitments
  is so that the payout structure is different. In this case, since only
  the server can broadcast the final balance (and the client has no way
  to close out the channel), only the B Commitment is necessary).
* HTLCs have significant malleability risks with malicious servers
  (hostage scenarios).
* If you presume full-RBF (which I think is a game-theoretic
  eventuality), clients can pay a higher fee to mutate the server's
  broadcast of the Commitment, which will result in the server's funds
  being held up permanently until the server is willing to negotiate
  (malleability hostage scenario).
* Exit Scamming is a distinct and likely possibility. The server can
  develop a good reputation for a while, then decide to screw over
  everyone. The server refuses to do any further transactions in any
  channel which has funds in the clients favor (current channel balance
  for the client is above what was funded). With the timeout, the server
  gets the original deposit back, which is above what they should get
  back, in other words, the server steals your money.
* This creates an asymmetric playing field. If one cannot be confident
  they will receive their funds back, this is similar to depositing your
  money on a hosted wallet such as Coinbase or whatever. The primary
  value of transacting on bitcoin is that the social costs of
  counterparty risks are minimized -- and counterparty risk is one of
  the primary inputs on interest rates (remove trust -&gt; remove
  counterparty risk -&gt; remove fees/interest). This can only exist if
  you're sufficiently willing to transact with nearly anyone (minimal
  underwriting).

&gt;<i> Furthermore, as there are less everyday payments on the blockchain,
</I>&gt;<i> there is more space for important transactions of higher value.
</I>
I agree that this is one of the primary values of payment channel based
systems. To extend and take your point in a different direction, there
is a risk if everyone uses blockchain transactions for every day
purchases, that high-value transactions will crowd out low-value
transactions. There is a tension that exists between the need for
sufficiently high fees to pay miners (when the block rewards decline)
and allowing low-fee transactions to be on-chain in a timely manner.
