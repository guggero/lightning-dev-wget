&gt;<i>         A - b - c - D - e - F - g - H
</I>&gt;<i>         H pays 0.003 mBTC to F (explicit source routing fee; H
</I>&gt;<i>         selected F for
</I>&gt;<i>         onion-routing towards D, without A's knowledge)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mean &quot;D selected F for onion-routing towards H&quot; here, surely?
</I>
No :-)

Both sides of a payment may value their privacy, so both sides may want
to perform onion routing independently. It's a bit similar to TOR hidden
services: you route from both sides towards a &quot;meeting point&quot; somewhere
on the route, which is not necessarily one of the end points.

Note that, because locking of transaction funds is always done in payer
-&gt; payee direction, this requires a separate routing phase before the
locking. So, first you find a route (where all parties say they agree to
fees, tx amount, timeouts and other conditions), and then you start
performing transaction-channel actions.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         A pays 0.002 mBTC to b (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i>         b pays 0.001 mBTC to c (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i>         D pays 0.001 mBTC to c (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i>         D pays 0.001 mBTC to e (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i>         F pays 0.001 mBTC to e (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i>         F pays 0.001 mBTC to g (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i>         H pays 0.001 mBTC to g (non-source routing fee)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These fees still don't vary with time&#8203;, so a 30s result versus a 4 day
</I>&gt;<i> result still has a factor of 10k difference in cost vs revenue. I
</I>&gt;<i> think over 4 days, a 0.20% fee is about reasonable matching the 0.002
</I>&gt;<i> fees that c, e and g end up with above (0.20%/4 days works out to a
</I>&gt;<i> 20% ROI per annum if all your channels are constantly at 100% use), so
</I>&gt;<i> linearising to an hour that's a 0.002% fee, which works out to 2
</I>&gt;<i> satoshi per mBTC per hour.
</I>
Yeah, after writing that e-mail, I realized I was contradicting myself a
bit. That system is OK for normal tx fees, but it doesn't seem to work
for &quot;delayed tx fines&quot;. It's a bit of an open question for me how to
distribute these fines on a mixed source/non-source routing network.

On the non-source routed parts, you can't check whether intermediate
nodes are honest when calculating the to-be-paid fines. Is that a
problem, or is it good enough to let the free market do its job, so that
nodes who demand too high fines will lose connections, just like with tx
fees? Anyway, I think that for the non-source routing parts, the height
of the fine (as a function of tx amount and delay) should be agreed
prior to performing a transaction. An intermediate node can demand a
payee-side fine that includes a weighed average of the fines it has to
pay payer-side on its other links, to stay profitable. This is the same
as with regular tx fees.

On the source-routed parts, the fines seem to end up with the end
points. Problems:
1. There is no persistent business / trust relationship and no payment
channel between endpoint and intermediate source-routed node. So there
is no way to enforce fine payment?
2. The payee endpoint is not always the bad guy in a delayed payment
scenario. It could be that fund locking from payer to payee stopped
somewhere in the middle of the route: in that case, the payee endpoint
rightfully never discloses R.

You could of course ignore source routing for the fines, and distribute
the fines as if it is only a non-source routing path. The problem is
that an attacker can create an arbitrarily long path with source
routing, thereby creating arbitrarily large total damage to the network,
corresponding to arbitrarily large total fines. If you use
pre-calculated fine amounts, an attacker can always make a route that
will result in a (large) loss for some intermediate nodes.
