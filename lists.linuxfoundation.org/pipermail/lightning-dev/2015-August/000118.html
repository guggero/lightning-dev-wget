<PRE>Hi Anthony,

Yes, reorg attacks are definitely a known with Bitcoin. You can send
money to an exchange and then double-spend withdraw several
confirmations later if you have infinite hashrate.

With lightning, I think to fund the channel, the minimum confirmation
times should be fairly high (even above 6 confirms). If a 120-block
reorg occurs, bitcoin is pretty busted anyway, might be of out-of-scope
with Lightning. IMO, lightning reduces this attack.

The nice thing about payment channels is that after it's set up, you
don't worry about confirmation times if it's off-chain. For that reason,
confirmation times (and block mining rate, ~10 minutes) matters a lot
less.

</I>&gt;<i> When setting up a new channel with an untrusted counterparty, you will wait

</I>&gt;<i> confirmations as long as it gains me $X?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - I open one or more anonymous channels, capable of receiving at least $X
</I>&gt;<i>  - I start the doublespend fork
</I>&gt;<i>  - I then simultaneously construct multiple lightning channels, funding
</I>&gt;<i> them at $d each.
</I>&gt;<i>  - I wait for N confirmations so my new channels are active.
</I>&gt;<i>  - I quickly route multiple payments from my new channels to my anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> channels until I can't send anymore
</I>&gt;<i>  - I publish the doublespending fork, so that my $d*n never got spent
</I>&gt;<i>  - I close my original anonymous channels gaining $X &lt;= $d*n
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only people worse off are the ones who opened the $d channels after N
</I>&gt;<i> confirmations -- any intermediary hubs are fine. Those hubs didn't have to
</I>&gt;<i> commit any funds to the new channels for the attack to work; the money they
</I>&gt;<i> lose was that in other channels they used to route my payments forwards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With onion routing, none of the ripped off hubs need know where the money
</I>&gt;<i> ended up, so there's not a lot of potential to do iron pipe cryptography to
</I>&gt;<i> get your money back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only constraints here (I think) are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - how many channels you can open in M-N blocks
</I>&gt;<i>  - you have to have &gt;$X funds available in the first place to commit to the
</I>&gt;<i> double spend
</I>&gt;<i>  - how much capacity the lightning network actually has in routable bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it costs 1.4*25*M bitcoin to mount a doublespend attack over M blocks
</I>&gt;<i> (ie bribing 67% of hashpower for the time it normally takes to do 2*M
</I>&gt;<i> blocks), and you can open 2000 channels per block, then that gives
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  X &gt; 1.4*25*M
</I>&gt;<i>  n &lt; 2000*(M-N)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  X &lt; d*n = d*2000*(M-N)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  1.4*25*M &lt; X &lt; d*2000*(M-N)
</I>&gt;<i>  35/2000 * M &lt; d * (M-N)
</I>&gt;<i>  35/2000 * (1 + N/(M-N)) &lt; d???
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Setting N = 12, M = 15 gives:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  d = 35/2000 * (1+4) = 7/80
</I>&gt;<i>  n = 6000
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so you're putting up 525 bitcoin by flooding the blockchain with anchor
</I>&gt;<i> transactions, sending it to yourself over lightning, then doublespending
</I>&gt;<i> the original 525 btc at a cost of spending ~505 btc on hashpower. Expensive
</I>&gt;<i> ($157k capital to make $6k profit), but still worthwhile (3.8% ROI in ~6
</I>&gt;<i> hours is 16% a day, or about 5e25 % annualised...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe if you make N depend on d you could mitigate this though -- something
</I>&gt;<i> like, if you to put &quot;$d&quot; on your side of the channel, you'll have to wait
</I>&gt;<i> for 5+(d*2000/25)*2 confirmations. So a $50 channel is d=.2 BTC, which is
</I>&gt;<i> ~37 confirmations, or about 6 hours. Increasing the blocksize (number of
</I>&gt;<i> channels openable per block) or lowering the block reward (decreasing the
</I>&gt;<i> cost of a doublespend fork) increases the confirmations required though...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
