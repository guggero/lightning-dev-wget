&#8203;I'm still not following how that's a problem? If C/D and D/E are really
quick and reliable, isn't it desirable to send more transactions their way
anyway?&#8203;

(a) &#8203;Assuming source routing. A chooses to route a payment. Her options are
&quot;A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E&quot; or &quot;A-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E&quot;. Based on time, she presumably chooses the
latter. Based on cost, maybe A-&gt;B or B-&gt;C has negative fees involved, so
she /might/ choose the longer path for slightly lower fees.

In that case either B is paying A to get funds on the B side of A-&gt;B or C
is paying A to get funds on the C side of B-&gt;C. In the latter case, I can't
imagine why C would want to punish B when she's desperate for funds that
she's offering negative fees. So afaics the only case is if B is paying A
to get funds to send back to A,

So, fund status is:

  D-&gt;E paid
  B-&gt;C locked
  A-&gt;B locked

and C-&gt;D is either paid or locked, leaving one of C or D out of pocket.
That's a cost to C or D of TIMEOUT*AMOUNT worth of funds on the B/C or C/D
channels, in order to encourage future transactions to deposit funds on C's
side of the A/C channel rather than the B/C channel. Since D doesn't
benefit directly, I don't see why he'd suffer the loss rather than letting
C do it.

But if C's willing to lose TIMEOUT*AMOUNT worth of time-value-of-bitcoin,
to encourage transactions over A/C rather than B/C, why doesn't she just
offer reduced/negative fees?

(b) Assuming onion routing, C/D don't actually know who A is -- it may be
someone that only has a connection to B; so if they delay transactions,
they run the risk that future txns will be routed A-&gt;B-&gt;F-&gt;E bypassing them
completely.

(c) Assuming non-source routing, by delaying transactions, they risk B
choosing a different route for future transactions, rather than A doing so.
I'm not sure how the liklihoods balance out there though.

Cheers,
aj
