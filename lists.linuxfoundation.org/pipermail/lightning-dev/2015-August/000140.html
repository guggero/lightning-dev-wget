&#8203;If they do that, C doesn't get paid until the timeout; and the only way D
gets paid is from C, and the only way E gets paid is from D. So I don't see
what good colluding actually does them? ie you just get:

Immediate:
  D pays E
  C pays D
Later:
  B pays C
  A pays B

But C could achieve that outcome on its own, just by delaying notifying B
until near the timeout; no collusion necessary. In any event, if the
transaction's going to succeed, the money on the B-C channel's HTLC is
going to be C's, so C is mainly depriving itself by filing to communicate.

If you have B and D collude instead, so that E reveals R to D, and D
reveals R to B instead of C, then the payments could go:

  D pays E
  D reveals R to B
  A pays B
  B pays D

with the transaction from B-&gt;C and C-&gt;D remaining open until the timeout,
but everyone else is square.&#8203; That would inconvenience C, possibly cheaply
for B and D. If there's already a channel between B and D (for the &quot;B pays
D&quot; step), I'm not sure why B and D wouldn't just announce that, and once it
was announced, I don't see why A would route via C anyway...

Cheers,
aj
