I changed my mind by the way.  You don't need to peel the onion, you
just need the commit transaction + htlc transactions tied to the closure
(and you can see the HTLC is yours, by the R value).

&gt;<i> &#8203;Okay, so how might this actually work?

</I>
A -&gt; B -&gt; C XXX D -&gt; E

&gt;<i>  * At this point Bob believes Carol has taken too long too, so he asks
</I>&gt;<i> Carol for an excuses. Carol says its Dave's fault, and points to the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction closing the Carol/Dave channel as evidence; Bob knows that Dave

</I>&gt;<i> reveals the P2SH script if necessary); Bob knows that Dave was who Carol
</I>&gt;<i> was forwarding to, because Carol provides a verifiable decryption of the
</I>&gt;<i> onion routing message Bob passed on to Carol.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Bob likewise passes this back on to Alice as the explanation of why it's
</I>&gt;<i> taking so long.
</I>
Yep, seems to work.

&gt;<i> Case 2: Carol misbehaves by pretending Dave was misbehaving, when he wasn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8203;* Carol closes the channel with Dave before accepting Dave's resolution
</I>&gt;<i> of the HTLC, passing the info to Bob as before.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203; * &#8203;Since he's not cheating, Dave claims the HTLC output on the blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Bob sees the HTLC output Carol was pointing at has been spent in a
</I>&gt;<i> timely fashion, indicating Carol is cheating.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Bob claims funds from Alice in a timely fashion, so does not have to
</I>&gt;<i> justify being a cheat himself.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Bob closes the channel with Carol since she's being weird.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;That seems like it works as expected to me?&#8203;
</I>
No, that doesn't work: Bob can't tell if Dave really sent it to Carol or
not.  But Alice doesn't care: she just knows that someone paid 2 txfees
in apology money for the delay.

To recap (mainly for others), there are two failure cases:

The good one:
1) Carol can't reach Dave in 20 seconds (no timely response to the
   update_add_htlc packet).  She send update_remove_htlc() back to Bob,
   who sends it back to Alice, undoing all the HTLCs just like any
   route or fee failure.

The bad one:
2) Dave starts the HTLC process, but then times out (doesn't resolve
   HTLC in 20*11 seconds, and doesn't send back a blame
   packet from Emma, either).

In the latter case, Carol dumps the commit tx to the blockchain, and the
screwed-up HTLC (and any other casualty HTLCs in progress, sorry).  She
can include this commit tx + htlc txs in the blame packet back to Bob;
there's no reason to name Dave AFAICT[1].

If Carol values Dave too much to drop the channel, she risks that Bob
will drop the channel with her.  It's not foolproof, but it provides
some disincentive.  I'm hoping that along with the profit motive, it's
sufficient.

Cheers,
Rusty.
