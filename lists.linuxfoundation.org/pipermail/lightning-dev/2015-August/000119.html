</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But Bob has both keys of the 2-of-2 multisig. One is his (main) key,
and the other one was supplied by Alice as a requirement to update the
channel and move funds.
But that is what I meant with mitigate it. Even if Bob claims all
payments, he will lose funds due to blockchain fees. (see below)

&gt;<i> You can't mitigate this by setting some reserve requirement, though. So
</I>&gt;<i> long as Alice has more money than Bob, she can do it. If Alice is 10x
</I>&gt;<i> richer than Bob, she doesn't *care* and she knows Bob will eventually
</I>&gt;<i> give up. &quot;Two-party escrow&quot; doesn't work because one party can have more
</I>&gt;<i> money and less time-value than another. Time-value is not a universal
</I>&gt;<i> value.
</I>
It is possible to say that the minimum (stealable) amount of Alice
must be higher than any sum of concurrent payments minus the
blockchain fees. This way Bob can always claim all the payments of all
Commitments of the Channel and still stay in positive net balance. It
really comes down to having an incentive to clear out payments of the
channel. Only open payments are problematic, settled balance can
always be stealed with just one transaction.
