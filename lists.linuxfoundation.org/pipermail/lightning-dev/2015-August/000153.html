Yep.

As I said before, you could never use this to convince anyone that
anyone was bad anyway.

Maybe Carol ignored Dave's perfectly valid reply.  Maybe Dave didn't
reply.  You can't tell.

&gt;<i> It would cost a
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoin transaction and lock up her bitcoins for the timeout period
</I>&gt;<i> (assuming she never finds out R), though -- but I'm not sure that's enough?
</I>
Someone bled (in fees and delayed funds).  That's hopefully enough; at
least it cost them to inconvenience you.

Cheers,
Rusty.
