There's no reason for the two to be connected.  You have a pubkey as
your ID for network and routing encryption, but you can offer any
transaction as an anchor, and use any keys you want.

Now, Joseph was suggested that it doesn't *have* to be this way, such
that the blockchain would show all the channels open, but while that's a
cute hack I don't think it's necessary.

Cheers,
Rusty.
