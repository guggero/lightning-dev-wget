</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   UPDATE_PKT
</I>&gt;<i>     NORMAL -[UPDATE_PKT]-&gt; Y -&gt;...

</I>
Yeah, I plan on eventually creating an RFC-style document which lays
this out.

At its core, it's fairly simple, and I'm starting to think that diagrams
more than a simple ASCII flowchart don't add anything.

&gt;<i> A lot of the &quot;an error occurred!&quot; abort paths apply to a whole bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> states, it would be nice to combine them in the output... Hmm, I think
</I>&gt;<i> that's doable...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've had a go at doing this with code. C is hard, so I converted to
</I>&gt;<i> python, and came up with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://azure.erisian.com.au/~aj/tmp/lightstate/statepy.svg">http://azure.erisian.com.au/~aj/tmp/lightstate/statepy.svg</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (source bits in the lightstate/ directory)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking it would be possible to update many HTLCs at once, so
</I>&gt;<i> I was expecting a single PKT_UPDATE_CHANNEL rather than the ADD_HTLC,
</I>&gt;<i> COMPLETE_HTLC, TIMEOUT_HTLC, etc variants. From a protocol POV, I guess
</I>&gt;<i> that's something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   UpdateChannel:
</I>&gt;<i>      int  n_ops
</I>&gt;<i>      op   ops[]
</I>&gt;<i>      int  commitment_len;
</I>&gt;<i>      byte commitment[]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where an op would be ADD_HTLC, COMPLETE_HTLC, TIMEOUT_HTLC,
</I>&gt;<i> ROUTEFAIL_HTLC, etc. That's a bit more complicated in the protocol,
</I>&gt;<i> but I think it pays off in simplifying the state diagram and hence the
</I>&gt;<i> software? (I think it's also kindof necessary for some fee models, and
</I>&gt;<i> will be useful for batching updates when performance eventually
</I>&gt;<i> matters)
</I>
This is the kind of optimization we may see later, but I really shy away
from doing it now.  Your diagram looks simpler because you removed all
the rest of the handshaking.  Try this:

A: ADD_HTLC --&gt; B: DECLINE_HTLC
  OR
A: ADD_HTLC --&gt; B: ACCEPT --&gt; A: SIGNATURE --&gt; B: COMPLETE

After success:

B: FULFILL_HTLC -&gt; A: ACCEPT --&gt; B: SIGNATURE --&gt; A: COMPLETE
  OR
B: ROUTEFAIL_HTLC -&gt; A: ACCEPT --&gt; B: SIGNATURE --&gt; A: COMPLETE
  OR
A: TIMEDOUT_HTLC -&gt; B: ACCEPT --&gt; A: SIGNATURE --&gt; B: COMPLETE

This makes the constraints clearer, eg. you can't DECLINE_HTLC anything
but an ADD_HTLC.

&gt;<i> Hmm, I find the PRIO stuff pretty klunky. It's only used to choose who
</I>&gt;<i> wins in the event of simultaneous/overlapping channel updates, no? Why
</I>&gt;<i> not just have a constant tiebreak in that case, eg, where whoever has the
</I>&gt;<i> lowest channel balance (or the lowest IP / key id), wins?
</I>
That could lead to livelock.

&gt;<i> Or alternatively, just have the high priority be given to whoever last
</I>&gt;<i> went from WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_SIG -&gt; NORMAL (and low priority to whoever
</I>&gt;<i> went from WAIT_FOR_UPDATE_COMPLETE -&gt; NORMAL). That way the priority
</I>&gt;<i> would still swap
</I>
Well, that would alternate at least.  But that seems more complex than
basing priority on the lower bit of the commitment number, which we have
to remember anyway.

&gt;<i> AFAICS, you still have a potential deadlock atm if you think you're
</I>&gt;<i> high priority but your counterparty also thinks they're high priority,
</I>&gt;<i> or just missed your update packet. I think there might be a similar
</I>&gt;<i> deadlock if both systems think they're low priority.
</I>
They can't get into that state.  And that's why it's spelled out in the
state machine, so I can exhaustively test (and have).

&gt;<i> If the INIT_NOANCHOR is meant to do to single-sided-anchor idea proposed
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1134319.msg11963141">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1134319.msg11963141</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> then it would probably be good to have a PKT_REBALANCE_VIA_BLOCKCHAIN
</I>&gt;<i> option; ie something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  0. channel is unbalanced: A has many funds, B has no funds
</I>&gt;<i>  1. B proposes rebalancing by $x.
</I>&gt;<i>  2. A accepts, chooses R, reveals #(R).
</I>&gt;<i>  3. B proposes HTLC from A to B of x funds, conditional on R.
</I>&gt;<i>  4. B posts $x in funds on the blockchain, payable to:
</I>&gt;<i>       [SIG_B &amp; R | SIG_A &amp; TIMEOUT]
</I>&gt;<i>  5. B tells A the transaction id (and p2sh details etc).
</I>&gt;<i>  6. A waits for this to be &quot;deep enough&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  7. A claims the blockchain transaction, revealing R.
</I>&gt;<i>  8. B completes the HTLC, rebalancing the channel.
</I>
We want A to be able to increase the channel too, so this doesn't quite
work.  I think we need to explicitly add a new anchor for that case.

But this idea is a subset of a more general &quot;swap to X&quot; HTLC, which
comes down to a routing problem, which is a layer up from this state
machine.

&gt;<i> Not being able to tack on orthogonal state makes things a little clumsy
</I>&gt;<i> here...
</I>
The state machine is hard to work with, but the payoff is exhaustive
proof that it's sane, and handles all possible cases.

Cheers,
Rusty.
