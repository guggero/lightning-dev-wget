&#8203;Are we talking about different transactions? I'm thinking:

 T1: Carol+Dave&#8203; Anchor(s)
  Inputs: whatever
  Output: requires Carol + Dave

 T2: Channel closure
  Inputs: T1
  Outputs:
    Carol balance
    Dave balance
    HTLC 1
    HTLC 2
    HTLC 3
    ...

 T3: Dave cashing in HTLC 2
  Input: T2 HTLC 2; R, Dave's key
  Outputs: whatever

For Carol to prove to Bob that she closed the channel, she points Bob at
T2/HTLC 3 providing the expanded P2SH as necessary, which reveals Dave's
&quot;lightning&quot; key as well as R. The anchor isn't really relevant.

But maybe Dave could have a different key for each channel, and choose them
independently of his lightning network id as used for routing (and the
corresponding public key used for onion routing)?

But if the key isn't linked, then Carol could construct her own
&quot;Carol-in-a-Dave-suit&quot; set of keys, and make a fake &quot;channel closure&quot;
transaction to convince Bob that Dave was being bad, It would cost a
bitcoin transaction and lock up her bitcoins for the timeout period
(assuming she never finds out R), though -- but I'm not sure that's enough?

Cheers,
aj
