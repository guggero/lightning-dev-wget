</I>&gt;<i> But it would be necessary to explicitly supply the block-height at which the transaction that includes the CLTV was signed. Otherwise miners would have no other info but the block it is included in from which to count the number of full blocks to add to the expiration time of the CLTV.
</I>
No, it would increase over time.  The CLTV block time and real block
time would diverge by 1 block / ~ 10 minutes every time a block is full.

It's the only sane way to do it, as you point out.

It doesn't help that we don't have a formal BIP to point at, but it's
probably a bit premature.

Hope that helps,
Rusty.
