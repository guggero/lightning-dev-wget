Yes, the point is that pending sends between participants in this cartel
have a shorter time than outside this cartel. So the point is that
C&lt;-&gt;D&lt;-&gt;E links will always have shorter HTLCs in transit than B's. It's
only C holding it up, but before that D and E decided not to hold it up.

</I>&gt;<i> just announce that, and once it was announced, I don't see why A would

</I>
Perhaps I may be misunderstanding things, but the purpose of not
announcing is to collectively make any paths to C delay closing out the
HTLC as long as possible, so that anyone that transacts with C has to
wait a long time, which will decrease the incentive to transact with C.
So the threat is that if C is being attacked, and B is not colluding,
then A and B will dislike transacting with C, even though it's not C's
fault. There's insufficient incentive to push funds when closing out the
HTLC (as opposed to pulling), e.g. A-&gt;B, due to the off-chance they
forget, but I may be wrong here, this is a bit speculative.
