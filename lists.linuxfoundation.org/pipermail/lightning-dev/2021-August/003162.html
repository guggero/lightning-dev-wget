<PRE>&gt;<i> 5) should we ever do confidential transactions we can't prevent it without compromising
</I>privacy / allowed transfers

I wanted to mention the dubiousness of adding confidential transactions to
bitcoin. Because adding CT would eliminate the ability for users to audit
the supply of Bitcoin, I think its incredibly unlikely to ever happen. I'm
in the camp that we shouldn't do anything that prevents people from
auditing the supply. I think that camp is probably pretty large. Regardless
of what I think should happen there, and even if CT were to eventually
happen in bitcoin, I don't think that future possibility is a good reason
to change the dust limit today.

It seems like dust is a scalability problem regardless of whether we use
Utreexo eventually or not, tho an accumulator would help a ton. One idea
would be to destroy/delete dust at some point in the future. However, even
if we were to plan to do this, I still don't think the dust limit should be
removed. But the dust limit should probably be lowered a bit, given that
the 546 sats limit is about 7 cents and its very doable to send 1 sat/vbyte
transactions, so lowering it to 200 sats seems reasonable.

</I>&gt;<i> the L2s ecosystems grow bigger...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, this would also constrain the design space of newer fee schemes.

</I>&gt;<i> Moreover as an operational point, if we proceed to such an increase on the
</I>&gt;<i> base-layer, e.g to 20 sat/vb, we're going to severely damage the
</I>&gt;<i> propagation of any LN transaction, where a commitment transaction is built
</I>&gt;<i> with less than 20 sat/vb outputs. Of course, core's policy deployment on
</I>&gt;<i> the base layer is gradual, but we should first give a time window for the
</I>&gt;<i> LN ecosystem to upgrade and as of today we're still devoid of the mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> to do it cleanly and asynchronously (e.g dynamic upgrade or quiescence
</I>&gt;<i> protocol [1]).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, as raised by other commentators, I don't deny we have a
</I>&gt;<i> long-term tension between L2 nodes and full-nodes operators about the UTXO
</I>&gt;<i> set growth, but for now I would rather solve this with smarter engineering

</I>&gt;<i> compressed colored coins/authentication smart contracts (e.g
</I>&gt;<i> opentimestamp's merkle tree in OP_RETURN) on the upper layers rather than
</I>&gt;<i> altering the current equilibrium.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We should remove the dust limit from Bitcoin. Five reasons:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) it's not our business what outputs people want to create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) dust outputs can be used in various authentication/delegation smart
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contracts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) dust sized htlcs in lightning (

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode which has implications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (AFAIU) for the regulatory classification of channels in various
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jurisdictions; agnostic treatment of fund transfers would simplify this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like getting a 0.01 cent dividend check in the mail)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) thinly divisible colored coin protocols might make use of sats as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value markers for transactions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) should we ever do confidential transactions we can't prevent it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without compromising privacy / allowed transfers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main reasons I'm aware of not allow dust creation is that:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) dust is spam
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) dust fingerprinting attacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1 is (IMO) not valid given the 5 reasons above, and 2 is preventable by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well behaved wallets to not redeem outputs that cost more in fees than they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are worth.
