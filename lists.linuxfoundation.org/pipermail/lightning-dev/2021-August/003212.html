I am a bit worried with a path which relies on constantly finding new heuristics to approximate a solution to an NP-hard problem:
* It allows too much room for nonconstructive disagreement between LN developers in the future.
  - In a worst case scenario, all implementations end up using different, incompatible heuristics because each group of developers thinks that they have the best one, leading to a suboptimal performance for everyone. Heuristics are less of an exact science after all.
* It makes the job of node operators less predictable, since it would depend more on the decisions of said developers with no guarantee of convergence to a single solution.
  - Node operators may perceive this as loss of decentralization to the developers.

Such an approach is much more suitable to debian, since they have full control and a complete view over their &quot;network&quot; of packages, as opposed to LN, which is decentralized, nodes come and go at will and they can be private (even from developers!).

Best,
Orfeas
