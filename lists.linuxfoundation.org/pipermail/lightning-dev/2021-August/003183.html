Sure, indeed, there's some additional costs which are not covered by failed HTLCs, nor incorporate the time the HTLC 
slot was used. But that wasn't my argument - my argument was that base + proportional is a much, much closer match for 
the costs of a node barring clever-er solutions around HTLC-slot-time-used. Dropping base fee makes the whole situation 
a good chunk *worse*.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. You have to pay the cost of a node. If we're really worried about this,

I think I agree, but I think they may currently be better than any *other* proposal, not that they're particularly good.

</I>&gt;<i> you keep ignoring that point.
</I>
I didn't ignore this, I just disagree, and I'm not entirely sure why you're ignoring the points I made to that effect :).

In all seriousness, I'm entirely unsure why you think proportional is just as good? As you note, the cost for nodes is a 
function of the opportunity cost of the capital, and opportunity cost of the HTLC slots. Lets say as a routing node I 
decide that the opportunity cost of one of my HTLC slots is generally 1 sat per second, and the average HTLC is 
fulfilled in one second. Why is it that a proportional fee captures this &quot;equally well&quot;?!

Yes, you could amortize it, but that doesn't make it &quot;equally&quot; good, and there are semi-serious proposals to start 
ignoring nodes that *dont* set their fees to some particular structure in routing decisions. Sure, nodes can do what 
they want, but its kinda absurd to suggest that this is a perfectly fine thing to do absent a somewhat compelling 
reason. This goes doubly because deploying such things significantly will mean we cannot do future protocol changes 
which may better capture the time-value of node resources!

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Additionally, I don't think HTLC slot usage needs to be kept as a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> limitation after we switch to eltoo;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The HTLC slot limit is to keep transactions broadcastable. I don't see why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this would change, you still get an output for each HTLC on the latest

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> eltoo gives us the ability to have channel factories....
</I>
That doesn't solve the issue at all - you still have a ton of transactions and transaction outputs and spends thereof to 
put on the chain in the case of a closure with pending HTLCs. In fact, most nodes today enforce a lower limit than the 
400-some-odd HTLCs that represent the transaction standardness limit, because 100KB transactions are stupid impractical.

&gt;<i> (By &quot;any time soon&quot; I mean, I could see software defaults changing if
</I>&gt;<i> over 50% of the network deliberately switched to zero base fees and found
</I>&gt;<i> it worked fine; and I could see deprecating non-zero fees if that ended
</I>&gt;<i> up with 90% of the network on zero base fees, no good reasons for node
</I>&gt;<i> operators wanting to stick with running non-zero base fees, and the
</I>&gt;<i> experimental algos that relied on zero base fees being significantly
</I>&gt;<i> easier to maintain or faster/better)
</I>
What is your definition of &quot;works fine&quot; here? In today's nearly-entirely-altruistic-routing-node network, we could 
probably entirely drop the routing fees and things would &quot;work fine&quot;. That doesn't make it a good idea for the long-term 
health of the network.

My suggestion is quite simple - that the software vendors wishing to rely on these types of algorithms *first* do the 
legwork to see what other ideas can be explored before jumping to &quot;ignore all the nodes who've decided their fees are 
X&quot;, because I think *that* is pretty bad idea for the long-term health of the network. I even suggested several areas of 
future research for folks to look into before we get to the point of in any way seriously relying on routing algorithms 
that constrain our ability to adapt fees in the future.
