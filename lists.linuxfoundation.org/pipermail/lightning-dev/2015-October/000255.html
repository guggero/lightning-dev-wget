Nifty.

In onion_key.c, I don't see why you're using flip_key() -- that's only 
needed for the single use onion-msg-keys, aiui?

You could save a sha call by using both halves of a sha for iv and pad_iv,
rather than two separate sha's. Otherwise don't see anything obvious to
do? I assume the ECDH step dominates as far as performance goes anyway?

</I>
I figured 20=floor(4096/192) which made sense to me. AFAICS the message
*needs* to include fee info and the forwarding address; so that's 4B and
20B-32B respectively (you could use the hash160 here and assume the
forwarding node can figure it out).

But maybe some nodes want to do clever things, like allow you to tell it
to deliberately delay forwarding for an hour or two, or deduct (different)
fees from multiple HTLC's simultaneously. But I guess 64B is probably
plenty for that?

Other thing is if you want to redirect an onion routed payment (which we
talked about as a possibility originally, as compared to only allowing
source-based routing). ie, a HTLC is sent from A to B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E, but
C actually needs to send it to D via X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z-&gt;D rather than doing it
directly. AFAICS, in that case you need to add and drop hops, ie:

   A-&gt;B:  - - - - - - - E D C B
   B-&gt;C:  b - - - - - - - E D C
   C-&gt;X:  c b - - - - - - - E D Z Y X
   X-&gt;Y:  x c b - - - - - - - E D Z Y
   Y-&gt;Z:  y x c b - - - - - - - E D Z
   Z-&gt;D:  c b - - - - - - - E D
   D-&gt;E:  d c b - - - - - - - E

ie, Z needs to be able to be told &quot;don't add padding, in fact, drop two
blocks worth of padding before forwarding&quot;. That presumably just needs a
byte or two of data; but it completely messes up the constant-size
packets. :-/

Cheers,
aj
