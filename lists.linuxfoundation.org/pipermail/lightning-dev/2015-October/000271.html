I guess the attacks I'm thinking of are something like:

Exploits leading to theft:

 - if you're a merchant, it's easy to find out your lightning id (just
   buy something from you!) and during the trading day you'll probably
   have a relatively large balance in your lightning channels (up until
   you close it out by committing your profits to the blockchain eg). If
   I can find your IP address and hack into your system, I can steal
   that money.

 - if you're making lots of money routing payments, I might be able to
   deduce that from public information (like how cheap your fees are,
   how rarely your fees change, how many connections you have, ...)
   and thus know that you have a lot of money in lightning channels that
   I can steal

 - if you're just being a consumer, however, I can't think of a reason
   your lightning id would matter -- if I can snoop on your IP connection,
   I can probably tell you're mostly a consumer by traffic analysis,
   and conclude that you've probably got $10-$100 that could be
   stolen. failure of imagination on my behalf?

Denial of service:

 - I might know the lightning id of someone I don't like; a merchant who
   sells something unpopular, or a node that routes payment for people I
   don't like. If I can translate that into an IP address, I might be
   able to DoS them using botnets etc.

Exploits that help you exploit others:

 - if I know X has a channel with you; figuring out X's IP might let
   me monitor X's TCP connections (by hacking into their system, or
   by subpoena'ing their ISP), which in turn would help me figure out
   your IP.

I guess there's three ways you can associate the info:

 a) given a lightning id, cheaply work out the IP that provides it

 b) given an IP, cheaply work out the lightning id associated with it

 c) given an IP and a lightning id, confirm/deny whether that lightning
    id is provided by that IP

(a) is what you want if you're planning theft or DoS

(c) is enough if you've got other information about whoever you want to
    attack that can narrow down the lightning ids and IP addresses (eg, you
    want to attack a local business, so you can find out their lightning id
    directly, and narrow down their IP based on local ISPs)

(c) is obviously trivial if you've already got (a) or (b).

You can get to (a) from (b) if (b) is cheap enough and you can build up
a database that you can query in reverse.

If you're not an attacker, then (a) is useful if you want to have new
channels not be totally random (eg, to have people be able to connect
to newly announced beacons). And (c) is presumably necessary if you
want to reconnect to someone you had a channel with, when you lose your
internet connction.

One &quot;clever&quot; way to handle (a) might be via a &quot;fund a new channel by
lightning transaction&quot; operation. ie, if you (Alice) want to open a
channel with Bob, route a payment to Bob with instructions to forward to
Alice, and to do that by connecting to a given IP/port and establishing
a new channel; ie rather than just telling Bob to route to Alice in the
onion payoad, also included Alice's network address. That way Alice
reveals her IP precisely to Bob; and Bob only reveals his IP if he
decides he is interested in opening a channel.

That'd also provide a way of reconnecting with a peer if you lose your
connection and both of you change your IPs. It assumes that you both
have an alternative channel that's still functional though.


Okay... so how about the following. When making a new p2p connection, when
you know who you're talking to, you rely on a shared secret X, and send:

    Alice: &quot;Hi. I'm &lt;session key A&gt;. My nonce is X.&quot;
    Bob: &quot;Good to meet you, I'm &lt;session key B&gt;.&quot;

Rest is encrypted to ECDH(A,B).

    Alice: SIG_Alice(Alice || Bob || A || ECDH(A,B))
    Bob: SIG_Bob(Bob || Alice || B || ECDH(A,B))

    Alice: &quot;Hi Bob!&quot;
    Bob: &quot;Hi Alice!&quot;


If you don't know who you're talking to, you don't send a nonce and
you do the current protocol. Once you're connected (or once you have a
channel setup) they'll tell you a nonce to use next time:

    Alice: &quot;Hi. I'm &lt;session key A&gt;.&quot;
    Bob: &quot;Good to meet you, I'm &lt;session key B&gt;.&quot;

Rest is encrypted to ECDH(A,B).

    Alice: I'm Alice, SIG(Alice || A || ECDH(A,B))
    Bob: I'm Bob, SIG(Bob || B || ECDH(A,B))
    Bob: BTW, next time you connect, use nonce &lt;Y&gt;.

If Bob wants some degree of privacy, while still accepting anonymous
connections, then he generates a new id to hand out to anonymous
connections every so often, linking it up to one of his other ids, or
to one of his neighbours by reusing a pre-existing channel. If you're
asking someone to connect to you and have a bunch of ids, you give them
a nonce to use that will select the correct one. You use nonces as a
hash key to lookup your id, their id, and any channels you have open.
You don't share or reuse nonces.

(If an attacker knows Alice and Bob have a connection, and can MITM
Alice trying to connect to X, the above lets them verify which of Alice's
connections is Bob. If that's a reasonable attack, it'd be avoidable if
the nonce X was replaced by X and Y; X sent in cleartext as above, but
Y simply included in the info being signed. That prevents the attacker
from being able to verify the signature info at all)

Not convinced that's quite right, but maybe something along those lines
might work out.

Until there's a substantial number of lightning nodes (1000s?), it's
probably trivial to link network address and lightning id by traffic
analysis, so I think it's probably sane to leave implementing any of
the above until later.

Cheers,
aj
