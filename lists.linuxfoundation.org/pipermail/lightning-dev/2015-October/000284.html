Bitcoin implementations could remove the confusion by simply specifying
how much total work there is expected to be, but that still allows
nuisance attacks with alternate chains.

My point was more that &quot;it's good enough for bitcoin&quot; so don't feel too
bad if we end up with clients hardcoding details about the lightning
network they expect to connect to (at the very least, its size).

Thanks,
Rusty.
