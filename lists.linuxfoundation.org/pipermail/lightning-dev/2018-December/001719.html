&gt;<i> For instance, the attacking intermediate node might guess that the next

</I>&gt;<i> replacing the onion packet it sends to the next node with a self-written
</I>&gt;<i> onion packet that has the next hop as final node, with the same amount
</I>&gt;<i> and payment hash as instructed by the incoming payment. If that
</I>&gt;<i> succeeds, it has learned that the next node is indeed the final node
</I>&gt;<i> (and nobody gets to know about the attack)
</I>
This is always true, regardless of construction, with our current
scheme.

&gt;<i> ; if that fails, it might
</I>&gt;<i> retry the payment with the original onion packet. In that case, it
</I>&gt;<i> learned that the next node is *not* the final node. In this case, the
</I>&gt;<i> attack is detectable by the next node though: it first receives an
</I>&gt;<i> incoming payment with a payment hash it doesn't recognize, and then it
</I>&gt;<i> receives a payment forwarding request with the same payment hash.
</I>
True.  Note that we go as far as preventing forwarding of the same onion
(for traffic analysis), but we don't block this more obvious attack.

&gt;<i> I think we could stop this type of attack by including some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> shared secret in the onion message to the final node:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Payee generates shared secret and passes this to payer, as part of the
</I>&gt;<i> invoice
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Payer includes shared secret in the per hop data to payee
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * On receiving the incoming message, payee checks whether the received
</I>&gt;<i> shared secret corresponds to the generated one. If this is not the case,
</I>&gt;<i> behave in exactly the same way as when the payment hash is unrecognized
</I>&gt;<i> (including timing, to prevent timing side-channel attacks).
</I>
This would indeed be an incremental improvement: I generally prefer not
to rely on the privacy of the invoice delivery, but this certainly makes
it no worse.

&gt;<i> The shared secret doesn't need to be very large: the number of attempts
</I>&gt;<i> per second (to guess the shared secret) is limited by network latency,
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth and maybe some artificial rate limiting. If an attacker can do
</I>&gt;<i> 100 attempts per second, then a 32-bit shared secret will take (on
</I>&gt;<i> average) 2^31 / (100*3600*24) = 248 days to crack, for a single guess of
</I>&gt;<i> which node is the final node. In the mean time, people will have noticed
</I>&gt;<i> the ongoing attack and will have taken countermeasures. Besides, the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction lock time will likely have expired in the mean time as well.
</I>
We could really just use the last 4 bytes of the signature, AFAICT.

Cheers,
Rusty.
