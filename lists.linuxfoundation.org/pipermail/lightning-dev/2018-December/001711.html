<PRE>Thanks Christian, that makes sense. Unfortunately it's not very clear
from the BOLT, at least not for me.

Now that I think of this type of attack: *in general* the HMAC prevents
this kind of attack, but isn't the attack still possible in certain
specific cases?


For instance, the attacking intermediate node might guess that the next
node in the route is the final node; it can test this by completely
replacing the onion packet it sends to the next node with a self-written
onion packet that has the next hop as final node, with the same amount
and payment hash as instructed by the incoming payment. If that
succeeds, it has learned that the next node is indeed the final node
(and nobody gets to know about the attack); if that fails, it might
retry the payment with the original onion packet. In that case, it
learned that the next node is *not* the final node. In this case, the
attack is detectable by the next node though: it first receives an
incoming payment with a payment hash it doesn't recognize, and then it
receives a payment forwarding request with the same payment hash.


Given that the attacker has good knowledge of the shape of the Lightning
network, this type of attack can be generalized to test whether a
certain second-degree neighbor, third-degree neighbor etc. is the final
node; it scales pretty badly with increasing network distance though. An
additional advantage for the attacker is that this gives plausible
deniability: if the attack becomes visible, the attacker can always
claim it wasn't him, but some node upstream in the route. A practical
difficulty for the attacker might be that the exact amount forwarded in
further-away hops is unknown, but it's probably not that difficult to guess.


I think we could stop this type of attack by including some kind of
shared secret in the onion message to the final node:

* Payee generates shared secret and passes this to payer, as part of the
invoice

* Payer includes shared secret in the per hop data to payee

* On receiving the incoming message, payee checks whether the received
shared secret corresponds to the generated one. If this is not the case,
behave in exactly the same way as when the payment hash is unrecognized
(including timing, to prevent timing side-channel attacks).

If this shared secret is encrypted like the rest of the per hop data,
the attacker can't learn the shared secret, and can't include it in his
own replacement onion. He can't copy-paste the encrypted shared secret
from the original onion either, since he has to use his own, different
ephemeral key in his own onion. With this protocol in place, a final
node can no longer be distinguished from a non-final node with this attack.


The shared secret doesn't need to be very large: the number of attempts
per second (to guess the shared secret) is limited by network latency,
bandwidth and maybe some artificial rate limiting. If an attacker can do
100 attempts per second, then a 32-bit shared secret will take (on
average) 2^31 / (100*3600*24) = 248 days to crack, for a single guess of
which node is the final node. In the mean time, people will have noticed
the ongoing attack and will have taken countermeasures. Besides, the
transaction lock time will likely have expired in the mean time as well.
