</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    +----+                              +----+
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   where node A is the &#8216;initiator&#8217; and node B is the &#8216;dual-funder&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We currently use the terms funder and fundee, which are now
</I>&gt;<i> inaccurate ofc.  Perhaps 'opener' and 'accepter' are not great english,
</I>&gt;<i> but they map to the messages well?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
'opener' and 'accepter' do map to the messages. I've adopted it for the
rest of this response, to see how it fits in context.

&quot;Another subtle point is the feerate_per_kw field; in the old scheme it
applied to the first commitment tx, but here it applies to both the
first commitment tx and the funding tx itself&quot;

You're right. Initially I didn't think the `accepter` would care since
they're not paying them,
but you need it to be able to construct the funding transaction. I'll add a
second field, it seems
important to keep them separated esp since the timing consideration for the
fees is different (now vs the future).

&gt;<i> The sending node:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    MAY begin channel establishment using `open_channel2`
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - MUST NOT send `open_channel`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise the receiving node:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    MUST return an error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a requirement for receiving `open_channel`  IIUC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ie.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The receiving node MUST fail the channel if:
</I>&gt;<i>    ...
</I>&gt;<i>    - `option_dual_fund` has been negotiated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Does v2 of channel open necessarily deprecate the original between two
upgraded nodes?

This seems more sane than having both as an option...will update.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ____`funding_puts2`
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can probably drop the 2 here and call it, um.. `funding_compose`?
</I>&gt;<i> (Thanks thesaurus.com).  I get where you're going with 'puts, but it
</I>&gt;<i> took me a while :)
</I>

Initially only the duplicated messages had the 2-suffix, but ended up
adding it to all of them to denote that they belonged to the v2 of channel
open... I can see how that's confusing though.

+1 for `funding_compose`, it's definitely more easily understood. :-D

...

&gt;<i> &gt;    MUST NOT send a number of `input_data` and/or `output_data` which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    exceeds the `put_limit`
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Side note: I wonder if we should relax this limit when we talk about
</I>&gt;<i> `option_will_fund_for_food`?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes! Thanks for pointing this out.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    MAY send an empty message
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Be explicit? MAY offer zero `num_inputs` and `num_outputs`.  That's not
</I>&gt;<i> quite an empty message...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I defined it a few lines above, but that's not super easy to see from this.
Will fix.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The receiving node:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   If is the initiator (A):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    MUST fail the channel if the `num_inputs` plus `num_outputs` is
</I>&gt;<i> greater
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    than the `put_limit`
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about MAY?  It's a protection thing, but less to change when we
</I>&gt;<i> option_will_fund_for_food.  Unless we set the `put_limit` to min (4) or
</I>&gt;<i> something in that case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1 for MAY, considering that the opener will be paying the fees.
The limit for what's reasonable to pay is fairly subjective, i.e. perhaps
the opener doesn't
 care how many inputs/outputs the acceptor adds.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, it needs to check max_extra_witness_len is reasonable too, since
</I>&gt;<i> that will affect the fees.  Each signature adds 74, and pubkey adds 34,
</I>&gt;<i> so I think MUST BE less than 500 is perfectly reasonable (for both
</I>&gt;<i> reader and writer).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ack


&gt;<i> &gt; ___`funding_locked2`
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; // same as v1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A dual-funding node (B):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    SHOULD broadcast their funding transaction if it does not see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    transaction broadcast after a reasonable timeout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's just reuse `funding_locked` maybe?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure why this should wait for broadcast?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was overthinking this*. Can't think of a reason for both sides not to
broadcast; will amend.

* confused it with conflicting transaction broadcast behavior


&gt;<i> &gt; == RBF for Channel Establishment v2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _____`init_rbf`
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This message is sent by the initiator, after the funding transaction has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been broadcast but before the `funding_locked2` has been exchanged.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [32: `channel_id`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [8: funding_satoshis]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [8:dust_limit_satoshis]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [8:channel_reserve_satoshis]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [4: feerate_per_kw]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [`2`:`num_inputs`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [`num_inputs*input_info`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [`2`:`num_outputs`]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [`num_outputs`*ouput_info`]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Typo again :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Requirements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The sending node:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - MUST be the initiator (A)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - MAY update the amount, fee rate, dust limit, or channel reserve for
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    channel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - MAY send init_rbf if it considers the most recent funding tx unlikely
</I>&gt;<i>    to be confirmed in reasonable time.
</I>&gt;<i>  - MUST set `feerate_per_kw` larger than the most recent funding tx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Another good reason to break out `funding_txn_feerate_per_kw` from
`commitment_txn_feerate_per_kw` in `open_channel2`


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do we really want to negotiate everything again?  It seems like the
</I>&gt;<i> funder should be able to maybe add *new* inputs and outputs (though TBH
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's going to be unusual enough that we could omit it), but
</I>&gt;<i> doing a wholesale replacement means we have to be careful that the all
</I>&gt;<i> RBFs end up having at least one input in common.  Yech.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Only allowing the opener to add new inputs/outputs drives down the scope of
a RBF a good deal. I like it.
Adding new inputs seems like a common sense bare minimum, especially if we
assume wildly unpredictable fee rates.


&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rationale:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once an `init_rbf` has been accepted by the dual-funding node, the
</I>&gt;<i> message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flow returns to `commitment_signed2` and proceeds as above, with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exception that the `temporary_channel_id` remains as the `channel_id` for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the currently published but unmined transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By this stage, we are no longer using temporary_channel_id though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it's an excellent point I had missed.  The channel_id changes on
</I>&gt;<i> each renegotiation.  We could either switch channel_id *after*
</I>&gt;<i> each accept_rbf, or keep the original channel_id until funding_locked2 (in
</I>&gt;<i> which case it should have a &quot;final_channel_id&quot; field, to make sure we're
</I>&gt;<i> talking about the same funding tx).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since we have to handle the &quot;oops, old one got in!&quot; it might be weird to
</I>&gt;<i> see `funding_locked2` with an old txid.  Perhaps we stick with the
</I>&gt;<i> original channel_id until then, and flip *after* funding_locked2 is sent
</I>&gt;<i> and received.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Would it be more sane to continue to include the temporary channel id,
in addition to the 'current' (i.e. most recently negotiated funding txn)
channel id,
until the funding_locked2 is sent  (adds a `temporary_channel_id` field for
`commitment_signed2`, ` funding_signed2` and `funding_locked2`, in addition
to `channel_id`)?
That way, all opening messages would have a stable id across an RBF
re-negotiation, `temp_channel_id`.
Sticking with the first broadcast funding transaction hash feels
a bit misleading in the case of a second round of `commitment_signed2` and
`funding_signed2`.


&gt;<i> And yeah, no `update_fee`, `announcement_signatures` until that
</I>&gt;<i> funding_locked2 exchange is complete, so we don't get those with an
</I>&gt;<i> unsettled channel_id.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The channel id that becomes fixed for this node will be determined by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `funding_locked2` message.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ___`accept_rbf`
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This message accepts an RBF request, and renegotiates a dual-funder&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; funds, dust limit, and channel reserve, and sends the dual-funder&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> updated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; puts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would make this an empty message, simply an ack.  And note that
</I>&gt;<i> the channel_id after this is that of the RBFed tx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question then becomes what do we do about reconnection.  I suggest:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> opener: if we haven't sent funding_signed, consider it cancelled.  If
</I>&gt;<i>    we've received funding_signed, it's obviously locked in.  If we sent
</I>&gt;<i>    and didn't received, re-xmit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> accepter: must remember rbf if we sent commitment_signed2.  If we
</I>&gt;<i>    received funding_signed it's locked in.  If we receive an init_rbf,
</I>&gt;<i>    drop the one we remembered.  If we receive funding_signed, continue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We still need to address the funding_tx construction; BIP69-style seems
</I>&gt;<i> like an unnecessary information leak here.  A 128-bit seed in
</I>&gt;<i> open_channel2 could be added, with sorting by SHA(seed | &lt;marshal of
</I>&gt;<i> input&gt; | &lt;marshal of witness&gt;) and SHA(seed | &lt;marshal of output&gt;)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phew!
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
