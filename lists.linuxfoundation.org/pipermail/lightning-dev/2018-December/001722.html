Well, I think we're heading to a TLV mechanism for the onion &quot;padding&quot;
anyway, so it works well there.

The only problem with this scheme is timing:
1. It's only useful once it's compulsory, since an adversary can always
   just not use it (downgrade attack).
2. Will we be able to upgrade the network to make it compulsory before
   Schnorr and decorrelation make it irrelevant?

I think it's a *maybe*, so I suspect we should Just Do It, since it's
simple.

Cheers,
Rusty.
