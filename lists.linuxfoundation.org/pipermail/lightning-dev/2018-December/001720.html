A stupid idea came to mind that would allow us to use no more space in
the onion at all: store the secret from the invoice in the HMAC
field. That would complicate the final hop checking on the recipient to
either being all 0x00, or some known secret (could also use a partial
HMAC so we can reduce the number of lookups we need to do). Another
option is that we could XOR it with some other field as well. The
recipient already signaled that it supports this by including a secret
in the invoice in the first place anyway, so no need for a lockstep
upgrade either.

Just putting it out there, I'm still unsure if I like it at all, since
it mixes field purposes, but it is an option if we decide this is a
serious issue.

Cheers,
Christian
