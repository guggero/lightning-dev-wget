<PRE>It seems like the router in this case is essentially short a straddle on
the BTC vs. WJT exchange rate with almost 0 premium. One way for the router
to hedge this is to be long an equivalent straddle by constructing their
own cross-chain payment to themselves with some other node, for the same
amount.

This obviously can't scale to all participants, but can possibly provide a
hedge for a single node.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs as American Call Option, or, How Lightning Currently Cannot Work
</I>&gt;<i> Across Assets, or, An Argument For Single-Asset Lightning Network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Introduction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ============
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In theory, the Lightning Network could potentially perform &quot;seamless&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> currency conversions, allowing a payer to spend one currency to pay a payee
</I>&gt;<i> requesting for another currency.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, a significant technical barrier prevents implementation of such
</I>&gt;<i> feature as of current designs (late 2018) for Lightning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The root cause of this significant technical barrier is the use of
</I>&gt;<i> hashlocked timelocked contracts to route payments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs can be used across cryptocurrency systems to transfer value
</I>&gt;<i> between them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From this point-of-view, every single Lightning Network channel is a
</I>&gt;<i> cryptocurrency system whose custodians are two entities, who are the only
</I>&gt;<i> entities who can use the system (the single Lightning Network channel).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs allow cross-system trades to be performed, so that participation
</I>&gt;<i> on any single Lightning Network channel can be leveraged to participation
</I>&gt;<i> over the entire Lightning Network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, HTLCs can also be used to construct American Call Options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Further, due to UX concerns, on the Lightning Network, there is no cost
</I>&gt;<i> incurred in merely setting up HTLCs for routing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By using the low-level HTLCs provided as primitives by Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> Network, one can set up American Call Options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These on-Lightning American Call Options, however, can be &quot;purchased&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for free (gratis), thus potentially earning money in a completely risk-free
</I>&gt;<i> manner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Abusing this gratis ability means that any Lightning Network node
</I>&gt;<i> advertising cross-asset on-Lightning exchange will find large amounts of
</I>&gt;<i> its liquidity tied up in stalled forwarding payments (in reality, American
</I>&gt;<i> Call Options) with a risk of monetary loss in case of large fluctuations in
</I>&gt;<i> exchange rate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hashlocked Timelocked Contracts as American Call Options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ========================================================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An American CallOption is a right (but not obligation) to purchase an
</I>&gt;<i> asset at a specific price, on or before an expiration date.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs allow building American Call Options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose we have Bitcoin, and some other asset, and both are on
</I>&gt;<i> blockchains that support the same hash function and can define HTLCs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is unimportant if both are on the same blockchain, or on different
</I>&gt;<i> blockchains, since HTLCs can work across cryptocurrency systems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An American Call Option has these properties:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  `P` = the price at which the asset can be purchased.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  `E` = the date at which the option expires.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose I, ZmnSCPxj, wanted to sell you an American Call Option  for 1
</I>&gt;<i> Widget (WJT) on the WJT blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We would then do the below ritual:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  You provide me a hash of some secret preimage that only you know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  You make an HTLC on the Bitcoin blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The value of this HTLC is `P`, the hash is the hash you gave above,
</I>&gt;<i> and the timelock is `E` + 1 day.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  I make an HTLC on the WJT blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The value of this HTLC is 1, the hash is the hash you gave, and the
</I>&gt;<i> timelock is `E`.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On or before `E`, you can claim the WJT on the WJT blockchain by
</I>&gt;<i> providing a transaction that reveals the preimage.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since the preimage is now revealed, I can then claim the Bitcoins of
</I>&gt;<i> price `P` on the Bitcoin blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alternately, you can simply not exercise this right, and at time `E` I
</I>&gt;<i> would then reclaim my WJT, and at time `E` + 1 day you would reclaim your
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, I want to *sell* this contract to you, so you would have to
</I>&gt;<i> pay me some bitcoins before we set up the above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A multi-stage construction of transactions that go through HTLC-like
</I>&gt;<i> constructs can be done on both blockchains to ensure that the above
</I>&gt;<i> contracts appear on both chains only if the payment for the actual contract
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. the &quot;premium&quot;) is done, and to enforce that both contracts appear if
</I>&gt;<i> the premium is paid, but that is beyond the scope of *this* writeup, which
</I>&gt;<i> will focus on how Lightning Network HTLCs can form the above construction
</I>&gt;<i> without any premium being paid.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs For Routing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs can be used to enforce trades across different cryptocurrency
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This property is used to allow routing of payments across different
</I>&gt;<i> channels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each channel is its own cryptocurrency system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose I, ZmnSCPxj, am an intermediate node on Lightning, and I wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to sell you my service of facilitating payments on Lightning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose you want to pay to somebody, who, for the sake of convenience,
</I>&gt;<i> we shall randomly call YAIjbOJA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As it happens, I have a channel with you, and a channel with YAIjbOJa.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You need to pay YAIjbOJA `P` bitcoins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We then perform the below ritual:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  YAIjbOJA provides you a hash, whose preimage only YAIjbOJA knows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  On your channel with me, you set up an HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The value is `P`+1 bitcoin (the 1 being my fee), the hash is the hash
</I>&gt;<i> you were given, and the timelock is 2 days from now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  On my channel with YAIjbOJA, I set up an HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The value is `P`, the hash is the same hash as above, and the
</I>&gt;<i> timelock is 1 day from now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (in reality, the timelocks are parameterized and selected by the payer
</I>&gt;<i> (you), and LN nodes will impose some &quot;reasonable&quot; limits on the timelocks;
</I>&gt;<i> but the first HTLCs set up must have longer timelocks than the later HTLCs)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Afterward, YAIjbOJA may claim, or may not claim, the money in the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> by releasing (or not releasing) the hash to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If YAIjbOJA claims the money, then I can take the hash and claim the
</I>&gt;<i> money, plus fee, from you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If not, then this is a payment failure and I will then cancel the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> you offered using standard Lightning Network primitives.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In general, we expect that YAIjbOJA wants to have the money because
</I>&gt;<i> every randomly-generated imaginary entity likes money.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus, in the case of payments, YAIjbOJA has a strong incentive to claim
</I>&gt;<i> the money without waiting for the timelock to expire or nearly expire.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can see that in practice, on the current Lightning Network, HTLCs are
</I>&gt;<i> often very transient and will be quickly claimed, despite having long
</I>&gt;<i> timelocks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This speed may mislead us into thinking that such convenience may be
</I>&gt;<i> possible across different assets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cross-Asset Lightning Nodes Offer Premium-Free American Call Options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ====================================================================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose that Lightning Network supports multiple assets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each channel has a single asset.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some nodes will advertise themselves as providing exchange capability,
</I>&gt;<i> taking one asset on one channel and exchanging it for another asset on a
</I>&gt;<i> different channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose I advertise myself as such an exchange.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose you want to pay to YAIjbOJA for 1 WJT, but have no WJT on hand
</I>&gt;<i> to pay YAIjbOJA, only bitcoins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As it happens, I have a bitcoin channel with you and a WJT channel with
</I>&gt;<i> YAIjbOJA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I advertise myself as exchanging `P` bitcoins for 1 WJT as of the
</I>&gt;<i> current time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Further suppose that in reality, YAIjbOJA is *you*, random Internet
</I>&gt;<i> person reading my thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You, your fake persona YAIjbOJA, and me, then perform the following
</I>&gt;<i> ritual:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  YAIjbOJA (really you) provides you with a hash whose preimage only
</I>&gt;<i> YAIjbOJA (actually you) know. (i.e. you just make it up)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  On the bitcoin channel with me, you set up an HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The value is `P`+1 bitcoin (the 1 being my fee), the hash is the hash
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;YAIjbOJA&quot; gave you (i.e. you really just made it up), and the
</I>&gt;<i> timelock is 2 days from now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  On the WJT channel with YAIjbOJA (really you), I set up an HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The value is 1 WJT, the hash is the hash you gave me, and the
</I>&gt;<i> timelock is 1 day from now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The above is now the same as the setup for an American Call Option with
</I>&gt;<i> expiration of 1 day from now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Further, within certain limits, you can set up the expiration of the
</I>&gt;<i> American Call Option to be longer or shorter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus, I have inadvertently given you an American Call Option, for *no
</I>&gt;<i> premium* (completely gratis), when my only intent was to facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> cross-currency Lightning Network payments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose that the price of 1 WJT rises far above the price of `P`+1
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoins before the expiration (1 day from now).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In such a case, &quot;YAIjbOJA&quot; (really you) will then release the hash and
</I>&gt;<i> acquire the 1 WJT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You then close this channel and claim the WJT onchain, then sell it
</I>&gt;<i> immediately to earn more than the `P`+1 bitcoins you paid.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alternatively, presumably I would have a new exchange rate I would be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to exchange WJT for, and you can just send the WJT with the new
</I>&gt;<i> exchange rate immediately over the Lightning Network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose that the price of WJT does not rise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since this is an option and *not* a future, &quot;YAIjbOJA&quot; (really you) will
</I>&gt;<i> simply claim that the payment errored somewhere and cancel the HTLCs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since even payment errors are not unwrappable and are onion-wrapped, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot determine whether the payment really errored, or you were just
</I>&gt;<i> setting up an American Call Option that you have now decided not to
</I>&gt;<i> exercise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Premium-free American Call Options Are Risk-free Earning Pumps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ==============================================================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Traditionally, options are analyzed assuming that the option itself has
</I>&gt;<i> a price, the premium.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This premium is the risk of the user of the option.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the user of the option does not exercise the option before the
</I>&gt;<i> expiration, then the premium is a pure loss of the user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, the above setup does not involve any payment when the option is
</I>&gt;<i> not exercised.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Payment failures are &quot;free&quot; (gratis) on the Lightning Network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, payment failures are also the non-exercised branch of the
</I>&gt;<i> American Call Option that can be set up on a cross-currency on-Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> exchange.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because the American Call Option is premium-free, even if the expiration
</I>&gt;<i> is very near, rational entities will still construct such options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Extreme volatility may occur in short time frames, especially in the
</I>&gt;<i> realm of digital assets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus, it is strongly likely that, if cross-asset exchange nodes on
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning Network exist, they will be exploited to create risk-free
</I>&gt;<i> American Call Options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They will find that significant liquidity will be tied up in such
</I>&gt;<i> American Call Options, and find that they will lose funds especially at
</I>&gt;<i> times of volatility.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can try to mitigate this, but the solutions below all have
</I>&gt;<i> significant drawbacks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  We could force that setting up the HTLCs requires payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    This forces the above American Call Options to have a premium.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The effect, however, is that routing failure is not free.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The current Lightning Network works despite not everyone publishing
</I>&gt;<i> the balances of channels, precisely because routing failure is free.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    We only need to have one route succeed in order to actually
</I>&gt;<i> successfully pay to the payee.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    With non-free routing failure, we cannot try many routes until one
</I>&gt;<i> succeeds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Suppose we limited this only to cross-asset exchanges.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      It would still require accurate knowledge of channel balances.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      This is because if a payment fails on a hop *after* the exchange,
</I>&gt;<i> the payer still loses money from that attempt to the exchange node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  Exchange nodes could increase their fees.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    This would create a wider &quot;spread&quot; of buying and selling assets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    This spread would increase friction in crossing assets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Also, this would only reduce risk; if the exchange rate is volatile
</I>&gt;<i> enough, then the option could still be exercised for riskless earnings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Rational entities will still tie up most of the liquidity on the
</I>&gt;<i> exchange on riskless American Call Options; even if the exchange rate is
</I>&gt;<i> very stable, they lose nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  Exchange nodes could limit the timelock of cross-asset swaps.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    This would increase friction in crossing assets, since a timelock
</I>&gt;<i> limit also imposes a limit to the route length.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    If one asset is much stronger than the other, then the weaker asset
</I>&gt;<i> will find its part of the Lightning Network to be strongly centralized
</I>&gt;<i> around the exchanges between the two assets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Payees of the weaker asset will strongly prefer to be at most one hop
</I>&gt;<i> away from exchanges in order to viably receive payments from payers who are
</I>&gt;<i> using the stronger asset.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Again, rational entities will also still tie up most of the liquidity
</I>&gt;<i> on the exchange on riskless American Call Options; again, even if the
</I>&gt;<i> exchange rate is very stable in short time frames, they lose nothing anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Conclusion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ==========
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLCs allow creation of American Call Options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The same HTLCs are used in Lightning Network to route across channels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If using a single asset, there is no issue related to time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regardless of the value of bitcoin relative to any other asset, in the
</I>&gt;<i> future, 1 BTC is 1 BTC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, across assets, the ability of HTLCs to create American Call
</I>&gt;<i> Options becomes troublesome.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These can then be exploited to earn money from exercise of the option.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Further, because Lightning UX would be degraded otherwise, payment
</I>&gt;<i> failures are free (gratis), leading to the American Call Options also being
</I>&gt;<i> free of premium.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This means that creating such options would be riskless, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> potential earnings upon any strong volatility of exchange rates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This implies that a multi-asset Lightning Network may not be
</I>&gt;<i> economically viable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead, Lightning Network would strongly prefer having a single asset
</I>&gt;<i> across the network.
