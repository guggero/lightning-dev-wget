<PRE>Hi all,

        In case you're bored with the limited range of improvements
going into the 1.1 spec, you might like to ruminate on:

  <A HREF="https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/blob/master/README.md</A>

It's a library for efficient summaries of data, such as bitcoin
transaction gossip.  It has an implementation sweet-spot at 64-bits,
which almost works well for our gossip messages.  I've a straw-man
protocol below.

===
1. type: 260 (`gossip_sync`) (`option_gossip_sync`)
2. data:
    * [`32`:`chain_hash`]
    * [`32`:`latest_block_hash`]
    * [`minisketch_len`:`minisketch`]

The `latest_block_hash` is because the whole sync is less reliable if
this differs between nodes, so a node may choose to wait, or adapt
accordingly if the other node is behind.

Because there is some overhead in maintaining the minisketch, it'd be
nice if we can have global agreement on the format so each peer need
only maintain one (i.e. no seed, no changing encodings depending on
block height, etc).

Fitting everything we need into 64 bits is possible, with various
degrees of ugliness; I've proposed one here:

We currently use a short_channel_id which has 3-byte block height,
3-byte txindex, 2-byte output index.  The biggest win is to combine
block height &amp; txindex into a &quot;txnumber since block 500,000&quot;, which only
needs about 27 bits per year; 40 bits for this number is sufficient for
the forseeable future.  2 bits for type, 1 for channel direction,
leaving 21 bits for output number and timestamp.

We can encode output number as N ones followed by a zero followed by
N*2+1 bits (commonly, this means 2 bits, but future mixers may make this
much larger).  The remaining bits are used as the lower bits of the
timestamp[1].

A node announcement is encoded by using the scid of the oldest channel
associated with the node, and the direction bit.

Using this direct encoding (rather than a hash of values) allows us to
immediately use an INV-style query, or maybe send automatically the
stuff the peer doesn't have.

The required size of the minisketch we send depends on the number of
differences with our peer.  We can use some minimum value (maybe based
on past gossip rates?), and add the number of changes we've received
since last time, increasing if we failed to reconstruct a previous one.

There doesn't need to be consensus between peers on the minisketch size
though, since truncated minisketches regrow into whole ones when tossed
back into the ocean[3].

Cheers,
Rusty.
[1]  You're supposed to refresh gossip every week, 17 bits should
    be sufficient.   And since the originator controls timestamps
    they can mitigate collisions themselves.[2]
[2] I wish I'd insisted we use block numbers for timestamps though
[3] I may have misunderstood this part, but it's basically magic.
