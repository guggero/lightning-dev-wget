<PRE>Good morning all,

It seems to me the below two worlds are possible:

1.  Symmetric delays.
1.1.  I can attack passively: I force a condition where most funds are in the other side (e.g. forwarding to another node I control, or exchanging BTC for material goods), then stop forwarding payments and generally being a pest.  The other side closes unilaterally in frustration (locking its funds) and I get penalized by having my (smaller, in my case) amount locked for some blocks.
1.2.  I can attack actively: I force a condition where most funds are in the other side, then unilaterally close the channel (locking my counterparty funds).  I get penalized by having my smaller amount locked for some blocks.

2.  Asymmetric delays.
2.1.  I can attack passively: I force a condition where most funds are in the other side (e.g. forwarding to another node I control, or exchanging BTC for material goods), then stop forwarding payments and generally being a pest.  The other side closes unilaterally in frustration (locking its funds) and I do not get penalized.

It seems to me that adding an entire new attack vector in order to only *mitigate* (not eliminate!) another attack vector is not a good enough trade-off.  In particular the new attack seems *easier* to perform.  The current attack where I annoy the other side until it closes has the risk that the other side may have a high tolerance for annoyance, and decide not to close the channel unilaterally anyway.  But in a symmetric-delay world, I do not have to wait for the other side to get annoyed: I just trigger the lockup period immediately in the active attack.

--

&gt;<i> For example, in the case where the side unilaterally closing the channel has zero balance, the other side gets no delay and symmetry as measured by (coins locked) * (duration of lock) equals zero on both sides. When the side closing the channel has at least 50% of the balance, both sides must wait the full delay. Thoughts?
</I>
So on channel setup where I am the funder to a 1BTC  channel I make to Daniel:

* Daniel holds a commitment transaction with: ZmnSCPxj=1BTC+no delay, Daniel=0BTC+no delay
* I hold a commitment transaction with: ZmnSCPxj=1BTC+no delay, Daniel=0BTC+no delay

In order to make the symmetry &quot;(coins locked) * (duration of lock)&quot; equal on both sides of the commitment transaction (after all, Daniel has 0 BTC, so the product 0BTC * anything is 0, so I should not be penalized with a delay on my output of the commitment transaction).

Then I send 0.99BTC to Daniel for 0.99BTC of Daniel products.

Then I publish my original, revoked, commitment transaction with ZmnSCPxj=1BTC+no delay, Danel=0BTC+no delay

Since there is no delay involved in my branch, I can get the money immediately without Daniel being able to revoke it.  So I get 1.0BTC and 0.99BTC worth of Daniel products.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
