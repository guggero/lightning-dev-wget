<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,

&gt;<i> I understand.  For myself, I will also wait for comment from other
</I>c-lightning
&gt;<i> developers: this seems to require a bit of surgery on our code I think
</I>&gt;<i> (currently construction of justice transactions is done in a separate
</I>process,
&gt;<i> and we always generate a justice transaction that claims all claimable
</I>outputs
&gt;<i> of the revoked commitment transaction), and we might decide to defer this
</I>&gt;<i> feature for later (leaking revocation basepoint secret is easy and
</I>requires
&gt;<i> maybe a few dozen sloc, but that requires a trusted WatchTower).
</I>
Certainly, it will require changes to ours as well. Would also love to hear
what the
other implementations think of such a proposal. As of now, we detect if the
commitment outputs have been spent, and if so, attempt to spend an
aggregate of
the commitment outputs and second-level outputs conditioned on which are
reported as spent. To realize this fully, we would need to also detect the
case
in which the second-level txns have already been spent, and then forgo
sweeping
them entirely (on the assumption that it has already been done by a
watchtower).

&gt;<i> Ah, I thought you wanted to impose some kind of contract on
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success to enforce this behavior, you are referring to a
</I>&gt;<i> technique that the attacker might attempt to use if we use only a single
</I>&gt;<i> justice transaction that claims all HTLC outputs.
</I>
Precisely, if the attacker knows that we can only sweep a particular sets of
outputs when batched, they can choose other sets that the watchtower can't
act
on. Spending them independently seems to resolve this.

&gt;<i> Good morning Conner,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I seem confused this idea.  Can you give example for commitment
</I>&gt;<i> with 2x
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure thing! The confirmation of second level HTLC txns can be separated by
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary delays. This is particularly true if the CLTVs have already
</I>&gt;<i> expired,
</I>&gt;<i> offering an attacker total control over when the txns appear on the
</I>&gt;<i> network. One
</I>&gt;<i> way this can happen is if the attacker iteratively broadcasts a single
</I>&gt;<i> second-level txn, waits for confirmation and CSV to expire, then repeat
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> another second-level txn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the CSVs begin ticking as soon as they are included in the chain,
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker could try to sweep each one immediately after its CSV expires.
</I>&gt;<i> If the
</I>&gt;<i> watchtower doesn't have the ability to sweep outputs independently, it
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> have no way to intercept this behavior, and prevent the breacher from
</I>&gt;<i> sweeping
</I>&gt;<i> individual HTLCs sequentially.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I thought you wanted to impose some kind of contract on
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success to enforce this behavior, you are referring to a
</I>&gt;<i> technique that the attacker might attempt to use if we use only a single
</I>&gt;<i> justice transaction that claims all HTLC outputs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5.  0 or 1 or 2 signatures for the main outputs. These sign a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction that claims only the main outputs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it seems necessary to separate the commitment outpoints from the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> outpoints in case the commitment txn is broadcasted before the CLTVs
</I>&gt;<i> expire.
</I>&gt;<i> You could try to batch these with the HTLCs, but then we get back into
</I>&gt;<i> exponential territory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that approximately what is needed?  Have I missed anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, I think your understanding is on point. IMO this seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> compromise of the tradeoffs at hand, and definitely something that could
</I>&gt;<i> serve
</I>&gt;<i> as an initial iteration due to its simplicity. In the future, there are definitely
</I>&gt;<i> ways
</I>&gt;<i> to improve on this on make it even more efficient! Though having a
</I>&gt;<i> solid/workable v0 is important if it is to be deployed. I enjoy hearing
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts on this, thank you for your responses!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for this confirmation.
