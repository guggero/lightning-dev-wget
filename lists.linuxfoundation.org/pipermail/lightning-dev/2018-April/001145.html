<PRE>Christian et al,

I've added additional wording to the PR to explicitly state BOLT 12 MUST
NOT be used for node bootstrapping.  I will squash the commits should this
proposal become a standard.

A side effect of this BOLT would be, as an example, the mobile Eclair
wallet could be updated to accept a domain parameter to specify an initial
node to open a user's first channel to rather than only the option to
&quot;autoconnect&quot; to their hard-coded node, and the wallet could handle
resolving and picking a node transparently, thus increasing
decentralization of &quot;fringe&quot; users such as mobile users and SPV nodes.

Criticism and feedback is enthusiastically invited.

Thanks,
Tyler

&gt;<i> Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think your points are all valid.  I believe the challenge with something
</I>&gt;<i> like this will be in it's general use and implementation, which is why the
</I>&gt;<i> RFC doesn't make mention of intended usage past mentioning different nodes
</I>&gt;<i> for &quot;clothing&quot; or &quot;ebooks&quot; a domain could advertise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Regarding looking up nodes at the time of payments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the future, nodes could negotiate a channel open with a push amount and
</I>&gt;<i> provide the TXID or payment hash as proof of their payment of the invoice.
</I>&gt;<i> This wouldn't even require the channel to be usable, and merchants could
</I>&gt;<i> decide to accept 1 (or even 0) confirmations of this transaction based on
</I>&gt;<i> their acceptable level of risk, considering the properties of the channel
</I>&gt;<i> (capacity, local balance etc).  So in that use case, this would be a rough
</I>&gt;<i> process of the interaction:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User tries to pay lightning invoice, and it fails.  The user's wallet
</I>&gt;<i> offers to pay via channel opening.  The user accepts.  The wallet reads the
</I>&gt;<i> invoice for a &quot;domain&quot; field, or perhaps if the wallet happens to be a
</I>&gt;<i> browser, it does a SRV lookup against the current domain serving the
</I>&gt;<i> invoice.  The wallet looks up the domain records, and verifies the
</I>&gt;<i> destination node is present.  If so, the wallet picks the correct node
</I>&gt;<i> based on the records present, and opens a channel with a push amount to
</I>&gt;<i> it.  The destination node sees this and via as some yet undetermined
</I>&gt;<i> method, associates it to that payment invoice and chooses to mark it as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;paid&quot; or &quot;pending X confirmations&quot; according to whatever criteria the node
</I>&gt;<i> operator wishes to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a simple example, you could list all of your nodes but prefer clients
</I>&gt;<i> open channels to a single one, similar to ACINQ's setup with &quot;endurance&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;starblocks&quot; on testnet.  This example would simply require setting
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;endurance&quot; to have the highest priority. This also allows domain operators
</I>&gt;<i> to have one or more public nodes, but many private ones with channels open
</I>&gt;<i> to their public nodes to better manage their risk. For example, the private
</I>&gt;<i> nodes could be behind a firewall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result of this is that the user experience is improved, and a side
</I>&gt;<i> benefit is being able to safely associate a given payment request, and by
</I>&gt;<i> extension node, with a domain.  Another nontrivial benefit is there will be
</I>&gt;<i> more channels opened with value on the other side, allowing for receiving
</I>&gt;<i> funds back from Lightning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some possible open questions regarding ensuring a payment
</I>&gt;<i> request hasn't been spoofed, but if you present the domain to the user,
</I>&gt;<i> he/she can verify that the wallet is about to open a channel to the domain
</I>&gt;<i> they expect.  Other issues with this are with DNS hijacking, which to be
</I>&gt;<i> frank is not an unlikely scenario.  Caution would be necessary, and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic means of associating nodes and their associated domains would
</I>&gt;<i> be a requirement for something like this to exist, but the proposed BOLT
</I>&gt;<i> lays the groundwork for that to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Future payments going through the merchant:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is probably the biggest wrinkle.  The merchant _does_ have the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to know when a payment transits the channel, thus reducing
</I>&gt;<i> privacy.  I think the proposed BOLT should only be used to improve user
</I>&gt;<i> experience, not as a replacement for the decentralized nature of
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning.  For example, node operators will use autopilot-like
</I>&gt;<i> functionality for opening channels, BUT they will be able to augment that
</I>&gt;<i> with looking up common stores and merchant's domain records and open their
</I>&gt;<i> own channels to them to provide alternate routes to popular anticipated
</I>&gt;<i> destinations for payments, thus making their own node more valuable and
</I>&gt;<i> increasing the decentralization of the network.  For example, if you know
</I>&gt;<i> people are going to be paying Starbucks, you can issue a DNS request of
</I>&gt;<i> your own, get their current preferred node and connect, and then any node
</I>&gt;<i> you have channels with will be able to pay Starbucks through you, without
</I>&gt;<i> having to open a channel of their own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Merchant crippling payments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the convention I described above, using channel opens as proof of
</I>&gt;<i> payment, if Starbucks wants to deny a customer the ability to pay McDonalds
</I>&gt;<i> (or simply doesn't have the appropriate channels to do so), the user's
</I>&gt;<i> wallet will simply fall back, look up mcdonalds.com, find the appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> node and pay the invoice via channel opening.  This also partly addresses
</I>&gt;<i> point 2, as if a merchant wants to spy on its customers, it must provide
</I>&gt;<i> routes to its competitors.  It can either spy or deny routes, but not
</I>&gt;<i> both.  In addition, the onion-like nature of payments means the merchant
</I>&gt;<i> can't be sure a user paid a competitor, or a node behind them, though some
</I>&gt;<i> configurations of channels and nodes can definitely reduce privacy quite a
</I>&gt;<i> bit (example: a tiny etsy shop only has a couple of connections, Evil
</I>&gt;<i> Starbucks being one of them with the largest channel.  A user paying an
</I>&gt;<i> amount above the second largest channel to this shop would have to use the
</I>&gt;<i> merchant's channel, and the merchant would be sure that the payment didn't
</I>&gt;<i> travel any further from there.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Network of large hubs:
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree.  Again, leaning on the ability to open channels with push
</I>&gt;<i> amounts that have some minor assurances (authority of DNS records) that
</I>&gt;<i> you're getting the node you intend, I expect routing node operators to
</I>&gt;<i> preemptively open channels to merchants they expect to receive payments,
</I>&gt;<i> and they could advertise their own node to do so, along with allowing
</I>&gt;<i> customers to connect directly to merchants.  The minimum requirement to use
</I>&gt;<i> this BOLT are the same as running a Lightning node full time, plus
</I>&gt;<i> ownership of a domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that said, I agree regarding the value of random connections in
</I>&gt;<i> strengthening the network.  Nodes are well-equipped to find inefficiencies
</I>&gt;<i> and correct them.  The intention of the BOLT is really to improve the
</I>&gt;<i> on-boarding experience, along with providing an additional means to
</I>&gt;<i> advertise &quot;official&quot; nodes to ease clients, especially mobile ones, onto
</I>&gt;<i> the network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your pessimism is warranted and invited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for the lengthy reply,
</I>&gt;<i> Tyler

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Tyler,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Robert,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first of all, welcome to the mailing list, always good to have more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people looking and improving the spec. I quickly read through the spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and it is very well written, and it looks good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a conceptual level, I do however have some issues with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. I don't think that the kind of selective attachment to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> node of a merchant is beneficial to neither the node that is opening the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel, nor for the network as a whole:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - For the node opening a channel at the time of a payment is too late,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    it basically means that for the first payment you'd have to wait for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    an on-chain confirmation, even if we use `push_msat` to perform the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    initial payment. This is bad for the user experience. Channels should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    be opened ahead of time so that, when the customer enters a shop,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    everything is already set up. Special cases are always hard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    communicate (&quot;you have to wait, but only this time, then in future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    all will be nice and quick&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - It also causes all future payments to go through that merchant, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    can now collate your shopping activity with all of your other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    payments, and create a profile. It's basically the hub-and-spoke
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    threat with the added problem of the hub also knowing your identity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - The merchant can cripple future payments that he might suspect are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    going to a competitor (Starbucks may attempt to block payments for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    amounts that look like coffee payments and go to their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    competitor). Think net neutrality for Lightning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - For the network as a whole this creates a network of large hubs that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    are only weakly interconnected, or not connected at all, unless the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    merchants are &quot;generous&quot; enough to maintain connections among each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    other.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But it's not all bad, I really like the possibility to look up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merchant's node ID through DNS, so that my wallet can check (indirect)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connectivity to that node and try to optimize their connectivity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should encourage people, and implement the clients, to open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> random connections, biased towards strenghtening the overall
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connectivity. With the gossip protocol we already disseminate enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information to allow nodes to identify bottlenecks and provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional capacity to bridge them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for being so pessimistic, but I think it's important we move away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from people attempting to open targeted channels directly to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merchants. I still regret publishing the IP address of SLEEPYARK.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Greetings,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; A challenge end-users face is connecting to nodes with enough liquidity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pay every merchant, and failing that, finding the merchant node in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reasonably sane way to open a channel to them for payments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As it is now, people find nodes in other people's visualizers, and pass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; node aliases around via word of mouth which is very prone to inaccuracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; MITM attacks. A current alternative is attempting to make a payment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; decoding the payment request, finding the node on your graph and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to open a channel to the merchant.  This is only possible if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; destination is advertising addresses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We (Robert Olsson and I) propose an additional BOLT, tentatively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scheduled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to be BOLT 12, to allow for operators of domain names to create SRV
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> records
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for their nodes.  This is separate from BOLT 10's seed functionality as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; desired outcome is to get only the nodes associated with a particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; domain.  This would allow, as an example, users to say to each other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;connect to a Blockstream.com node&quot; and the user can independently look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that domain, find advertised nodes and connect/open channels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This also improves security from the perspective of nodes masquerading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; other nodes, as anyone with a domain can authoritatively list their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In addition, domain operators could provide subdomains for their node
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; addresses to distinguish between nodes intended for a specific purpose,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; from a human perspective.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Robert Olsson (rompert) and I have created
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/406">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/406</A> as a draft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what the RFC could look like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Feedback is much appreciated.
