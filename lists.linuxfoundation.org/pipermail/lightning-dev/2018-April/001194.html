<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,

&gt;<i> It seems to me, that the only safe way to implement a trustless
</I>WatchTower,
&gt;<i> is for the node to generate a fully-signed justice transaction,
</I>IMMEDIATELY
&gt;<i> after every commitment transaction is revoked, and transmit it to the
</I>&gt;<i> WatchTower.
</I>
No, one doesn't need to transmit the entire justice transaction. Instead,
the client simply sends out the latest items in the script template, and a
series of _signatures_ for the various breach outputs. The pre-generated
signature means that the server is *forced* to reproduce the justice
transaction that satisfies the latest template and signature. Upfront, free
parameters such as breach bonus (or w/e else) can be negotiated.

&gt;<i> The WatchTower would have to store each and every justice transaction it
</I>&gt;<i> received, and would not be able to compress it or use various techniques
</I>to
&gt;<i> store data efficiently.
</I>
In our current implementation, we've abandoned the &quot;savings&quot; from
compressing the shachain/elkrem tree. When one factors in the space
complexity due the *just* the commitment signatures, the savings from
compression become less attractive. Going a step father, once you factor in
the space complexity of the 2-stage HTLC claims, then the savings from
compressing the revocation tree become insignificant.

It's also worth pointing out that if the server is able to compress the
revocation tree, then their necessarily linking new breach payloads with a
particular channel. Another downside, is that if you go to revocation tree
compression, then all updates *must* be sent in order, and updates cannot be
*skipped*.

As a result of these downside, our current implementation goes back to the
ol' &quot;encrypted blob&quot; approach. One immediate benefit with this approach is
that the outsourcing protocol isn't so coupled with the current _commitment
protocol_. Instead, the internal payload can be typed, allowing the server
to dispatch the proper breach protocol based on the commitment type. The
blob approach can also support a &quot;swap&quot; protocol which is required for
commitment designs that allow for O(1) outsourcer state per-client, like the
scheme I presented at the last Scaling Bitcoin.
