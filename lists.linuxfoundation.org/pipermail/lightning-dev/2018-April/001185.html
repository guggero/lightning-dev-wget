<PRE>I believe that anyone attempting a DOS by forcing on-chain settlement can
do it just as easily with asymmetric delays than with symmetric delays.

If my goal is to waste the time-value of your money in a channel, in a
world with symmetric delays, I could just publish the commitment
transaction and you would have to wait the full delay for access to your
funds. True. But with delays asymmetric as they are now, I can just as
easily refuse to participate in a mutual close, forcing you to close
on-chain. This is just as bad. In fact, I'd argue that it is worse, because
I lose less by doing this (in the sense that I as the attacker get
immediate access to my funds). So in my assessment, it is a very active
attack and symmetric delays are something of a mitigation. You are right
that the balance of funds in the channel becomes a factor too, but note
that there is the reserve balance, so I'm always losing access to some
funds for some time.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that you bring this up, I think, it is indeed a concern, and one we
</I>&gt;<i> should not take lightly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a purely selfish rational being, it matters not to me whether my
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction will delay your output or not; all that matters is
</I>&gt;<i> that it delays mine, and that is enough for me to prefer a bilateral close
</I>&gt;<i> if possible.  I think we do not need to change commitment transactions to
</I>&gt;<i> be symmetrical then --- it is enough that the one holding the commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction has its own outputs delayed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I had a goal to disrupt rather than cooperate with the Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> Network, and commitment transactions would also delay the side not holding
</I>&gt;<i> the commitment transaction (i.e. &quot;symmetrical delay&quot; commitments), I would
</I>&gt;<i> find it easier to disrupt cheaply if I could wait for a channel to be
</I>&gt;<i> unbalanced in your favor (i.e. you own more money on it than I do), then
</I>&gt;<i> lock up both our funds by doing a unilateral transaction.  Since it is
</I>&gt;<i> unbalanced in your favor, you end up losing more utility than I do.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, in the situation where you are funding a new channel to me, I have
</I>&gt;<i> 0 satoshi on the channel and can perform this attack costlessly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now perhaps one may argue, in the case of asymmetric delays, that if I
</I>&gt;<i> were evil, I could still disrupt the network by misbehaving and forcing the
</I>&gt;<i> other side to push its commitment transaction.  Indeed I could even just
</I>&gt;<i> accept a channel and then always fail to forward any payment you try to
</I>&gt;<i> make over it, performing a disruption costlessly too (as I have no money in
</I>&gt;<i> this).  But this attack is somewhat more passive than the above attack
</I>&gt;<i> under a symmetrical delay commitment transaction scheme.
