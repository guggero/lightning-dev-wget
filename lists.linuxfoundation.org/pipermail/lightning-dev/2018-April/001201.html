</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand.  For myself, I will also wait for comment from other

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers: this seems to require a bit of surgery on our code I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (currently construction of justice transactions is done in a separate
</I>&gt;<i> process,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and we always generate a justice transaction that claims all claimable
</I>&gt;<i> outputs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the revoked commitment transaction), and we might decide to defer this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature for later (leaking revocation basepoint secret is easy and
</I>&gt;<i> requires
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe a few dozen sloc, but that requires a trusted WatchTower).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, it will require changes to ours as well. Would also love to
</I>&gt;<i> hear what the
</I>&gt;<i> other implementations think of such a proposal. As of now, we detect if the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> commitment outputs have been spent, and if so, attempt to spend an
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate of
</I>&gt;<i> the commitment outputs and second-level outputs conditioned on which are
</I>&gt;<i> reported as spent. To realize this fully, we would need to also detect the
</I>&gt;<i> case
</I>&gt;<i> in which the second-level txns have already been spent, and then forgo
</I>&gt;<i> sweeping
</I>&gt;<i> them entirely (on the assumption that it has already been done by a
</I>&gt;<i> watchtower).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, I thought you wanted to impose some kind of contract on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success to enforce this behavior, you are referring
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technique that the attacker might attempt to use if we use only a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; justice transaction that claims all HTLC outputs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Precisely, if the attacker knows that we can only sweep a particular sets
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> outputs when batched, they can choose other sets that the watchtower can't
</I>&gt;<i> act
</I>&gt;<i> on. Spending them independently seems to resolve this.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good morning Conner,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I understand. It would be good to know what you have, and perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; planning a new BOLT document for such.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, that is the ultimate goal. I think it might be a little to soon to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full-on BOLT spec. There are still some implementation details that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to address before formalizing everything. I am working to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> written up in the short-term documenting the approach[es] that ends up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solidified. Hopefully that can get some eyes during development, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serve as working document/rough draft.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand.  For myself, I will also wait for comment from other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c-lightning developers: this seems to require a bit of surgery on our code

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is easy and requires maybe a few dozen sloc, but that requires a trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WatchTower).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I seem confused this idea.  Can you give example for commitment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with 2x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; HTLC?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sure thing! The confirmation of second level HTLC txns can be separated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arbitrary delays. This is particularly true if the CLTVs have already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expired,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offering an attacker total control over when the txns appear on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network. One
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way this can happen is if the attacker iteratively broadcasts a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second-level txn, waits for confirmation and CSV to expire, then repeat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another second-level txn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since the CSVs begin ticking as soon as they are included in the chain,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacker could try to sweep each one immediately after its CSV expires.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watchtower doesn't have the ability to sweep outputs independently, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have no way to intercept this behavior, and prevent the breacher from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sweeping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual HTLCs sequentially.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah, I thought you wanted to impose some kind of contract on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success to enforce this behavior, you are referring to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technique that the attacker might attempt to use if we use only a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> justice transaction that claims all HTLC outputs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 5.  0 or 1 or 2 signatures for the main outputs. These sign a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; transaction that claims only the main outputs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, it seems necessary to separate the commitment outpoints from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outpoints in case the commitment txn is broadcasted before the CLTVs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expire.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You could try to batch these with the HTLCs, but then we get back into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exponential territory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is that approximately what is needed?  Have I missed anything?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nope, I think your understanding is on point. IMO this seems to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compromise of the tradeoffs at hand, and definitely something that could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as an initial iteration due to its simplicity. In the future, there are definitely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to improve on this on make it even more efficient! Though having a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solid/workable v0 is important if it is to be deployed. I enjoy hearing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoughts on this, thank you for your responses!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for this confirmation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
