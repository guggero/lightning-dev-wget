<PRE>Hi Christian,

&gt;<i> That's not as bad a tradeoff as people usually interpret, the DMC
</I>&gt;<i> construction has parameters that allow tweaking the number of
</I>&gt;<i> invalidations, and with parameters similar to LN we can have 1.4 billion
</I>&gt;<i> updates. Which is years of operation without need to
</I>&gt;<i> re-anchor. In addition penaltyless invalidation has a number of
</I>&gt;<i> advantages,
</I>
As far as I understand, long-lasting DMCs require either:

 &#160;&#160;&#160; (a) an initial Refund transaction with a very distant relative 
locktime
 &#160;&#160;&#160; (b) periodic updates in the form of a Refund transaction pointing 
to a new Refund transaction resetting initial the locktime, instead of 
actually refunding.

 &#160;&#160;&#160; For an extreme case of (a), if one party goes unresponsive and 
decides not to sign new commitments then the counterparty in the DMC 
will have its funds locked for a significant amount of time, without 
penalising the unresponsive party. In the extreme case of (b), either if 
as a result of a malicious, unresponsive, or honest participant, each 
new refund transaction that resets the refunds may end up hitting the 
blockchain, which means the worst-case utility of the channel itself 
decreasing due to accumulative blockchain fees. Is this the trade-off 
you speak of? if so, can you point at any resource where this trade-off 
is tackled to get worst-case utility similar to that of LN channels?

Best,
Alejandro.
</PRE>
