<PRE>Great points.  IsStandard() is something I hadn't considered yet, but I
think miners are incentivized to want Numerifides transactions as a
registration will need a solid miners fee, and &quot;revoked&quot; names will cause
escalating fee wars that the miners can just soak up.  I think a standard
that uses mappings in a sane way (and maybe pushdata2/4 won't be allowed if
255 bytes are enough) would be allowable given the benefit it brings of
truly decentralized, human-readable trust.

I also wonder what the economic incentive might be for every node to store
and gossip the Numerifides mappings - sure they want everyone to find them,
but who cares about other people? It could be a situation like the current
Bitcoin mempool where it's saved on a best-effort basis and is
semi-transient, but that makes troubleshooting lookups problematic.

Also, I know this is only tangentially related to Lightning so if this is a
discussion best left off the mailing list, just let me know.

Thanks,
Tyler

&gt;<i> Good morning Tyler,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the efficiency your method brings and I'm also not that enthused
</I>&gt;<i> about bloating the blockchain with &quot;non-financial data&quot;, however I do think
</I>&gt;<i> there's value in having the data live in the base chain, both from
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility and censorship resistance of the data to less additional
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;networks&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gossiped data is almost impossible to censor (ask Streisand how well that
</I>&gt;<i> works to censor her Malibu home).  However, mere gossip is often
</I>&gt;<i> unverifiable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we do here is twofold:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  We use the blockchain layer for verification.  Commands &quot;google.com=127.0.0.1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are backed by actual Bitcoin satoshi being locked, sacrificing opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> costs, making them costly and verifiably costly, unlike gossip which is
</I>&gt;<i> unverifiable.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  We use the gossip overlay for censorship resistance.  Once a command
</I>&gt;<i> has been confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain, we can share that command to
</I>&gt;<i> our peers on the gossip overlay, and unless all our peers are colluding, it
</I>&gt;<i> is likely that a command gets out somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This design also uses P2WSH, so 51% miners, at least, cannot censor
</I>&gt;<i> Numerifides commands: all they see is a hash of something which could be a
</I>&gt;<i> LN fundchannel or a M-of-N SegWit or etc etc. We wait for the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> to confirm (which starts the CSV relative-locktime countdown anyway), after
</I>&gt;<i> which the miner cannot &quot;take back&quot; its confirmation of your Numerifide
</I>&gt;<i> command without losing costly work, and only THEN reveal the P2WSH preimage
</I>&gt;<i> on the Numerifides gossip overlay network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The gossip overlay then provides censorship resistance on top of that,
</I>&gt;<i> revealing the preimage of the P2WSH (AFTER it has been confirmed onchain)
</I>&gt;<i> and revealing your Numerifide command.  It is unlikely that anyone can stop
</I>&gt;<i> the gossip overlay unless they control your entire Internet connection, in
</I>&gt;<i> which case you have more serious problems and might not even be able to
</I>&gt;<i> have a current view of the Bitcoin blockchain anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Already today any user that includes a commensurate miner's fee can use
</I>&gt;<i> the pushdata opcodes and add whatever data they want to the blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted.  It still makes bitcoin-dev cry when this is done.  And in any
</I>&gt;<i> case, reducing the blockchain footprint has real benefits of reducing the
</I>&gt;<i> amount that gets given to miners and increasing what can be put into
</I>&gt;<i> command bids anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that the design requires is a separate method of communicating
</I>&gt;<i> bindings and not being censored - if it were onchain, a DNS lookup could
</I>&gt;<i> simply be no more than a light client requesting the relevant block.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly.  Note however that the &quot;publish everything onchain&quot; design
</I>&gt;<i> requires cooperation of a Bitcoin miner, since it seems you are using
</I>&gt;<i> scriptpubkey rather than P2WSH.  In particular the IsStandard() check will
</I>&gt;<i> mean your transaction will not get transmitted on the normal Bitcoin peer
</I>&gt;<i> network and you will need direct connection and cooperation of a Bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> miner, to get your non-standard script in a scriptpubkey.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you intend to use P2SH or P2WSH, then you will need a gossip layer to
</I>&gt;<i> reveal the script preimage anyway, so you might as well use the more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient P2WSH-based construction I showed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think anything that gets seriously far along will need to have some data
</I>&gt;<i> crunched and if only 100 users per day would fill up blocks then of course
</I>&gt;<i> constraints would necessitate other avenues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  Knowing that, we might as well start efficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
