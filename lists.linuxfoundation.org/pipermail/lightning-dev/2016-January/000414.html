&gt;<i> Personally, I think both this and shachain have the indexing backwards;
</I>&gt;<i> I think i=0 should match the seed, and the first hash transmitted across
</I>&gt;<i> the wire should be i=2^64-1, then counting down from there. This matches
</I>&gt;<i> the numbering used in <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain</A> fwiw.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> With shachain, that gives the nice property that the only parameter
</I>&gt;<i> you need is the seed, you can work out the hash for any given index
</I>&gt;<i> directly from that, up to any arbitrary index, until you run out of
</I>&gt;<i> integer precision, or bits of security in your hash function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With elkrem you can build an arbitrarily deep tree given a seed at the
</I>&gt;<i> conceptual level without any further parameters, but when you start
</I>&gt;<i> mapping that to indexes you need to know the desired height first.
</I>
We can just say &quot;64 bits is enough for everyone&quot;, and be done.

&gt;<i> This is, in essence, because L(seed) (eg) gets sent at different places
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the &quot;height&quot;; with a height of 1 it's the first value (or
</I>&gt;<i> third from last), with a height of 2 it's the third value (or fifth
</I>&gt;<i> from last), with a height of 3 it's the seventh value (or ninth from
</I>&gt;<i> last), etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably doesn't really matter, but I think it leads me to prefer Rusty's
</I>&gt;<i> construction. Might be good to have an explanation with it diagrammed
</I>&gt;<i> as an n-way tree structure though, in a similar way to how you visualise
</I>&gt;<i> the elkrem tree...
</I>
Definitely; a 64-deep binary tree is a 64-dimensional 1x1...x1
hypercube, but the former is less brainhurty.

&gt;&gt;<i> - R value vs keypair
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Using a simple secret &quot;redeemhash&quot; allows easy tracing of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     transactions through the network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Mats Jeratsch proposed a keypair scheme which decorrelates them[3],
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Greg Maxwell optimized it slightly, and Anthony Towns[4] and Andrew
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Poelstra independently came up with a way to do it without any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     bitcoin mods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW I think this should still be considered an R&amp;D idea rather than
</I>&gt;<i> trying to release it in v1.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Multi-sig txs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - Joseph pointed out that by simply allowing more than one signature on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     commit txs[5], we can enable escrow-style services (including things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     like GreenAddress.it which does this for normal wallets).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's &quot;more than one hash&quot; not more than one /signature/, isn't it? (The
</I>&gt;<i> proposal was also to support 2-of-3 hashes, slightly more complicated
</I>&gt;<i> than just multiple hashes)
</I>
You're right, it's multiple hashes.  Which gives me an idea I'll post
separately.

Thanks!
Rusty.
