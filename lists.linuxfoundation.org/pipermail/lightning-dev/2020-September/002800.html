<PRE>Hi Johan,

&gt;<i> I would be open to patching the spec to disallow update_fee for anchor
</I>&gt;<i> channels, but maybe we can just add a warning and discourage it.
</I>
My initial thinking was just to restrain it for the commitment-level only.

Completely adhering to the bring-your-own-fee model for HTLC-txn sounds
better as it splits more fairly fees burden between channel participants.
The initiator won't have to pay for the remote's HTLC-txn, especially in
periods of high-congestion. A participant shouldn't have to bear the cost
of the counterparty choosing to go onchain, as it's mostly a client
security parameter (&quot;how many blocks it will take me to confirm ?&quot;)  or an
economic decision (&quot;is this HTLC worthy to claim/expire ?&quot;).

One could argue it's increasing the blockspace footprint as you will use
one more pair of input-output but if you're paying the feerate that's
lawful usage.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very good observation, most definitely not a type of attack I forseen!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily, it was the plan to phase out update_fee all along, in favor
</I>&gt;<i> of only accepting the minimum relay fee (zero fee if/when package

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Antoine,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Great findings!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think an even simpler mitigation is just for the non-initiator to
</I>&gt;<i> _reject_
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update_fee proposals that are &quot;unreasonable&quot;. The non-initiator can run a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;fee leak calculation&quot; to compute the worst-case leakage of fees in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; revocation case. This can be done to day without any significant updates
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementations, and some implementations may already be doing this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One issue is that we don't have a way to do a &quot;soft reject&quot; of an
</I>&gt;<i> update_fee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as is. However, depending on the implementations, it may be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reconnect and issue a co-op close if there're no HTLCs on the commitment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you mentioned by setting proper values for max allowed htlcs, max in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flight, reserve, etc, nodes are able to quantify this fee leak risk
</I>&gt;<i> ahead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time, and set reasonable parameters based on their security model. One
</I>&gt;<i> issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that these values are set in stone rn when the channel is opened, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; future iterations of dynamic commitments may allow us to update them on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the mid-term, implementations can start to phase out usage of
</I>&gt;<i> update_fee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by setting a minimal commitment fee when the channel is first opened,
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relying on CPFP to bump up the commitment and any HTLCs if needed. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discovery might very well hasten the demise of update_fee in the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all together as well.  I don't think we need to depend entirely on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; theoretical package relay Bitcoin p2p upgrade assuming implementations
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; willing to make an assumption that say 20 sat/byte or w/e has a good
</I>&gt;<i> chance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of widespread propagation into mempools.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From the perspective of channel safety, and variations of attacks like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;flood &amp; loot&quot;, imo it's absolutely critical that nodes are able to
</I>&gt;<i> update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the fees on their second-level HTLC transactions. As this is where the
</I>&gt;<i> real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; danger lies: if nodes aren't able to get 2nd level HTLCs in the chain in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time, then the incoming HTLC expiry will expire, creating a race
</I>&gt;<i> condition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; across both commitments which can potentially cascade.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In lnd today, anchors is still behind a build flag, but we plan to enable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it by default for our upcoming 0.12 release. The blockers on our end
</I>&gt;<i> were to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; add support for towers, and add basic deadline aware bumping, both of
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are currently on track. We'll now also look into setting clamps on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receiver end to just not accept unreasonable values for the fee rate of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commitment, as this ends up eating into the true HTLC values for both
</I>&gt;<i> sides.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In this post, I would like to expose a potential vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> introduced by the recent anchor output spec update related to the new usage
</I>&gt;<i> of SIGHASH_SINGLE for HTLC transactions. This new malleability combined
</I>&gt;<i> with the currently deployed mechanism of `update_fee` is likely harmful for
</I>&gt;<i> funds safety.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This has been previously shared with deployed implementations devs, as
</I>&gt;<i> anchor channels are flagged as experimental it's better to discuss and
</I>&gt;<i> solve this publicly. That said, if you're currently running experimental
</I>&gt;<i> anchor channels with non-trusted parties on mainnet, you might prefer to
</I>&gt;<i> close them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; # SIGHASH_SINGLE and `update_fee` (skip it if you're familiar)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First, let's get started by a quick reminder of the data set committed
</I>&gt;<i> by signature digest algorithm of Segwit transactions (BIP 143):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * nVersion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * hashPrevouts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * hashSequence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * outpoint
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * scriptCode of the input
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * value of the output spent by this input
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * nSequence of the input
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * hashOutputs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * nLocktime
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * sighash type of the signature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Anchor output switched the sighash type from SIGHASH_ALL to
</I>&gt;<i> SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY for HTLC signatures sent to your
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty. Thus it can spend non-cooperatively its HTLC outputs on its
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transactions. I.e when Alice broadcasts her commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, every Bob's signatures on Alice's HTLC-Success/Timeout
</I>&gt;<i> transactions are now flagging the new sighash type.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thus `hashPrevouts`, `hashSequence` (ANYONECANPAY) and `hashOutputs`
</I>&gt;<i> (SINGLE) aren't committed anymore. SINGLE only enforces commitment to the
</I>&gt;<i> output scriptpubkey/amount at the same index that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the spending input. Alice is free to attach additional inputs/outputs
</I>&gt;<i> to her HTLC transaction. This change is aiming to let a single-party bump
</I>&gt;<i> the feerate of 2nd-stage HTLC transactions in case of mempool-congestion,
</I>&gt;<i> without counterparty cooperation and thus make HTLC funds safer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The attached outputs are _not_ encumbered by a revokeable redeemscript
</I>&gt;<i> for a potential punishment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That said, anchor ouput spec didn't change disable the current fee
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism already covering HTLC transactions. Pre/post-anchor channels are
</I>&gt;<i> negotiating a feerate through `update_fee` exchange, initiated by the
</I>&gt;<i> channel funder. This `update_fee` can be rejected by the receiver if it's
</I>&gt;<i> deemed unreasonable compared to your local fee estimator view, but as of
</I>&gt;<i> today implementations are pretty liberal in their acceptance, admitting a
</I>&gt;<i> divergence from a scale of 1 to no-bound at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This negotiated feerate (`feerate_per_kw`) is used by channel
</I>&gt;<i> participants to compute effective fees which have to be deduced either from
</I>&gt;<i> the funder balance output for commitment transactions or from HTLC output
</I>&gt;<i> value for HTLC transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; # The Vulnerability : a Penalty Escape Vector
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; By increasing the feerate thanks to `update_fee`, a malicious party can
</I>&gt;<i> inflate fees committed on HTLC input/output pairs and redirect this
</I>&gt;<i> inflated fee to a single-controlled output attached to these malleable
</I>&gt;<i> pairs. This won't be punishable by an honest party in case of revoked state
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast and thus enable to partially escape the penalty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As an example, Alice and Bob have a 100_000 sats channel.
</I>&gt;<i> `feerate_per_kw` is 10000 sats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At state N, Alice balance is all on her side. She announces 10 outgoing
</I>&gt;<i> HTLCs of value 7000 sats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As Commitment tx weight with 10 outputs is 2844 (post-anchor), the
</I>&gt;<i> absolute fee committed is 28440 sats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As HTLC-timeout weight is 666 (post-anchor), the absolute fee committed
</I>&gt;<i> is of 6660 sat, the HTLC tx output as counter-signed by Bob is of 340 sat.
</I>&gt;<i> This absolute fee aims to pay the miner fee in case Alice needs to timeout
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Her remaining balance is 1560 sat, above both dust_limit_satoshi and
</I>&gt;<i> the channel reserve as constrained by Bob (likely 1%).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Alice waits for HTLCs to expire and advances state to N+1. Then she
</I>&gt;<i> empties her balance minus reserve by sending a HTLC relayed by Bob either
</I>&gt;<i> to a colluding channel on the rest of network or back to an onchain address
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to a swap service.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At state N+2, Alice finalizes HTLC-timeout of state N by capturing
</I>&gt;<i> almost all of the absolute fee to a new P2WPKH output only controlled by
</I>&gt;<i> her. She broadcasts the revoked commitment tx N and burns 28440 sats in
</I>&gt;<i> commitment fee.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Her balance of 1560 sats is punished by Bob's justice transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; After confirmation and thus maturing of the CSV of 1 on her HTLC output
</I>&gt;<i> Alice broadcasts her 10 HTLC-timeout sending back to her 6660 sat - 660 to
</I>&gt;<i> pay a low-fee. Bob punishes the 10 HTLC-timeout outputs of 340 sats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Alice gain =  99_000 (swap spend) + 66_660 (HTLCs escape) - 1560
</I>&gt;<i> (commitment balance punishment) - 28440 (commitment fee) - 660*10 (HTLCs
</I>&gt;<i> fees) - 340*10 (HTLCs output) = 125600 sats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Alice's gain is superior at channel value as it has been partially
</I>&gt;<i> double-spend by bypassing the revocation punishment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; # Limitations of Attacker Success
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A first limitation of attack success which can be point of is the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that post-anchor HTLC outputs are CSV'ed by 1, which means in theory a
</I>&gt;<i> honest party can punish this output before the malicious spend them with
</I>&gt;<i> the revoked HTLC txn. In practice a malicious party can attach a branch of
</I>&gt;<i> descendants to its anchor output and that way only allowing one more
</I>&gt;<i> mempool victim's transaction on the revoked commitment. The victim must
</I>&gt;<i> spend all outputs at once or otherwise they're going to obstrucate each
</I>&gt;<i> other at mempool acceptance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Secondly, other limitations  are the per-implementation channel policy
</I>&gt;<i> `max_accepted_htlcs`, `max_htlc_value_in_flight`, `channel_reserve` and
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance bound of `update_fee`. A quick look at default policies, even if
</I>&gt;<i> they vary between deploy implementations, let it think there is room to
</I>&gt;<i> escape a substantial part of channel value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Lastly, after the revoked commitment transaction is confirmed, both
</I>&gt;<i> attacker and victim are in a feerate race to confirm either a justice
</I>&gt;<i> transaction or a malicious HTLC-timeout. As fee estimator logic of the
</I>&gt;<i> victim's implementation is a public piece of knowledge, it shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> hard for the attacker to know the range of the first fee bid and override
</I>&gt;<i> it by a bit to confirm it before the victim RBF at next block. Currently,
</I>&gt;<i> not all implementations have RBF of justice transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As of today, if anchor output is deployed and given how LN
</I>&gt;<i> implementations are managing fees/rebroadcast of onchain transactions, the
</I>&gt;<i> chance of attack success sounds high in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; # Countermeasures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Channel policies could be tighter, like bounded further down
</I>&gt;<i> `max_accepted_htlcs` or restraining acceptance of `update_fee`. For the
</I>&gt;<i> latter, it's pretty hard as a) fee estimators diverge on mempool views b)
</I>&gt;<i> an attacker can craft escape HTLC-txn in a period of high-fee and patiently
</I>&gt;<i> waits a low-fee period to launch the exploitation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Justice transactions can adopt a scorched earth approach binding their
</I>&gt;<i> feerate to the max to increase odds of winning the feerate race and thus
</I>&gt;<i> deter attackers. But this sounds like introducing a griefing attack vector.
</I>&gt;<i> Your counterparty can burn more of your lawful balance in fees than you'll
</I>&gt;<i> punish its revoked balance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A workable option would be to patch current anchor spec to remove
</I>&gt;<i> `feerate_per_kw` appliance on 2nd-stage transactions, maybe just committing
</I>&gt;<i> a minimal relay fee.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thoughts of further countermeasures ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think the vulnerability described is mostly right but please point
</I>&gt;<i> any missing details.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
