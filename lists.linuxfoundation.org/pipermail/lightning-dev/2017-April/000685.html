<PRE>Good morning all,

Below is a collection of how to make funding transactions for micropayment
channels even if SegWit is never activated.

Even with transaction malleability, revocation is possible by the use of
revocation keys, and thus, bidirectional micropayment channels are possible.

However, the creation of micropayment channels is significantly more
difficult without a malleability fix and segregated signatures.

In the below, Alice wants to provide 1.0 BTC to the channel while Bob
only wants to provide 0.25 BTC. Both agree to give 0.01 BTC, each, as
transaction fees. The total input is thus 1.27 BTC.

== Timelocked ==

The funding transaction has two outputs:

1. 1.0 BTC to (Alice &amp;&amp; CSV + 1 week) || (Alice &amp;&amp; Bob)
2. 0.25 BTC to (Bob &amp;&amp; CSV + 1 week) || (Alice &amp;&amp; Bob)

Commitment transactions have two inputs, which are both of the outputs
of the funding transaction.

Channel construction begins with the funding transaction being broadcast
over the Bitcoin network. Both sides wait for the transaction, or a
malleated version thereof, to be confirmed on a block. Once both sides
have confirmed, they may generate commitment transactions referring to
the confirmed funding transaction and sign each other's commitment
transactions.

Because of the timeout, the side which has received more money than it
originally put into the channel must close the channel before the
timeout. This puts a strict upper limit to the duration of the channel.

Drawback: The timeout serves two masters. On the one hand, if channel
opening must be aborted due to noncooperation between both sides, the
money is locked up for the timeout duration; if one side needs the
money transmitted quickly and does not have enough money to fund a
different channel, the other side may force an abort and hostage the
funds until the timeout. On the other hand, the timeout limits the
lifetime of the channel, and it's best if the channel has a long
lifetime if the channel can be succesfully opened.

Channel Lifetime: Limited.

Abort: Funds are tied up for the channel lifetime if opening is
aborted.

Cost: Low; only one transaction is needed to open.

Hostage: Possible if one side needs to transfer the money quickly
and cannot afford to have its funds tied up in case of an abort.

== Child Pays For Parent ==

The funding transaction has two outputs:

1. 1.25 BTC to (Alice &amp;&amp; Bob)
2. 0.02 BTC to (Alice &amp;&amp; Bob)

Since the funding transaction spends all 1.27 BTC of input, there is
no transaction fee, so miners are not incentivized to mine the funding
transaction, or any malleated version thereof. Thus, if both sides
are cooperating, they may safely broadcast this transaction on the
Bitcoin network without worry of counterparty hostaging of funds.

After the funding transaction has been created and signed by both
sides, they can create commitment transactions referring to the
unmalleated funding transaction. Once both commitment transactions
are signed by the counterparty, the two sides create a new, Child
Pays For Parent transaction which inputs the funding transaction's
output containing the decided miner's fee and having a 0 output
to an arbitrary address. The CPFP transaction is then broadcast to
the Bitcoin network, and the two sides wait until the funding
transaction is confirmed (which requires that the CPFP transaction
also be confirmed in the same block). After confirmation, the
channel may be used.

In case of an abort, both sides may spend an input of the funding
transaction immediately (and should do so for safety).

Malleated versions of the funding transaction would not be mined,
as they have 0 transaction fees.

Drawback: Hostaging is possible with the cooperation of a miner;
it might not even require a malicious miner. Some miners have a
service that lets users pay the miner to include a transaction
with low transaction fees onto the miner's block. A fraudulent
counterparty may create a malleated version of the funding
transaction, then provide it to a miner transaction-speedup
service with a fee. Once in a block, the other counterparty's
money is held hostage indefinitely.

Drawback: Miners might not support CPFP correctly for various
reasons. This may slow down the funding transaction getting
confirmed until a miner supporting CPFP gets around to the
funding transaction and its CPFP.

Channel Lifetime: Unlimited.

Abort: Funds in the channel are unencumbered (and in fact
should be moved to another address for safety) if opening is
aborted.

Cost: Medium; two transactions, but both with relatively
simple scripts.

Hostage: Possible with miner cooperation.

== Hashlocked Escrow ==

The funding transaction needs to be very complicated. In
addition, each side needs to place in escrow the value of
the counterparty's fund; thus, it forces symmetry. For
example, even if Bob wants to commit only 0.25 BTC while
Alice commits 1.0 BTC, Bob must still temporarily commit
1.25 BTC, then withdraw 1.0 BTC afterwards.

Prior to building the funding transaction, both Alice and
Bob individually create escrow release keys. These are
simply short pieces of data. The output script contains
the hash of those data.

The funding transaction takes 1.26 BTC from Alice and
1.26 BTC from Bob. It has four outputs:

1. 1.0 BTC to (Alice &amp;&amp; Bob) || (Bob &amp;&amp; AliceEscrowKey)
2. 0.25 BTC to (Alice &amp;&amp; Bob) || (Alice &amp;&amp; BobEscrowKey)
3. 1.0 BTC to (Bob &amp;&amp; CSV + 2 hours) || (Alice &amp;&amp; AliceEscrowKey)
4. 0.25 BTC to (Alice &amp;&amp; CSV + 2 hours) || (Bob &amp;&amp; BobEscrowKey)

Commitment transactions take the first two outputs. Channel
opening completes by creating an Escrow Recovery Transaction
that inputs the #3 and #4 outputs above, and distributes them
to the correct counterparty in the correct amounts (1.0 to
Bob, 0.25 to Alice).

First, each side generates Escrow Release Keys as mentioned,
then provides the hash of those keys to each other and
constructing, signing, and broadcasting the funding
transaction.

When the funding transaction is confirmed, each side creates
commitment transactions and signs its counterparty's. Finally,
before 1 hour (half the timeout) both of them must create the
Escrow Recovery Transaction and have both sides acquire a fully
signed copy.

To abort, either of output 3 or 4 must be spent, which also
implicitly releases the corresponding output 1 or 2 to the
other party.

Drawback: If the Bitcoin network is backlogged, race
conditions may occur that allow either counterparty to steal
coins outright from the other counterparty in an abort.
If Alice wants to abort, she makes a transaction recovering
output 3 of the funding transaction. This publicizes
AliceEscrowKey. If that transaction is stuck unconfirmed
until the 2-hour timeout passes, Bob can make transactions
spending outputs 1, 3, and 4, and may boost up the miner fees
or use a miner's speedup service to speed up the transaction
spending output 3. Both of Alice and Bob now enter a heated
transaction battle, with both of them attempting to claim
outputs 3 and 4 in addition to their &quot;safe&quot; money in output 2
(for Alice) and output 1 (for Bob).

Drawback: You need to escrow money equal to your counterparty's
funding commitment. If the reason you would prefer to have a
low funding commitment on your end is due to lack of funds,
your counterparty is forced to lower his or her funding
commitment to equal yours. But if your counterparty is likely
to send you money than you will send him or her, this is
inefficient, as both of you are forced to close the channel
when it saturates.

Channel Lifetime: Unlimited.

Abort: Part of the fund put into the channel is unencumbered,
while the other part is tied up for 2 hours if opening is aborted.

Cost: High; funding transaction is complicated, and another
transaction is needed to complete the opening.

Hostage: Not possible to my knowledge.

ZmnSCPxj
