We will eventually move away from the hash function based approach in favor
of something that allows us to decorrelate hops in a route. We have indeed
started writing down some of the ideas at least for Lightning in the
project's wiki [4], but they're definitely not fleshed out.

</I>&gt;<i> Christian, thank you for your knowledgable reply. The footnotes did not

</I>&gt;<i> primitives, cataloged in terms of the cryptocurrency technologies which
</I>&gt;<i> require them. Such a resource could help the community respond more
</I>&gt;<i> quickly, comprehensively, and transparently to the inevitable cryptanalytic
</I>&gt;<i> surprises that will pop up over time (especially from the quantum
</I>&gt;<i> cryptanalytic area, but even the classical cryptanalytic community as well).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Related, I believe the ideal end state would be to only assume existence
</I>&gt;<i> of a preimage-resistant hash function, and to code such that one function
</I>&gt;<i> could be quickly swapped with another and thus update entire system. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure if that is a realistic goal, but here is my first attempt to move
</I>&gt;<i> in that direction in case it is of interest to lightning. It is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> imagine it would be a new idea, although I have not yet found the precedent:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Routing is still very much in flux, we have a minimally viable routing
</I>&gt;<i> protocol in the spec [1]. It is minimal in the sense that we just push
</I>&gt;<i> the entire network's topology to the edges, which can then locally
</I>&gt;<i> compute routes. This is effectively a source-routed network, which
</I>&gt;<i> matches the requirements of the onion routing protocol we use for
</I>&gt;<i> privact as well. But this does not mean that this is protocol is set in
</I>&gt;<i> stone. We are actively working on finding better solutions to the
</I>&gt;<i> problem of finding routes across a vast network of millions if not
</I>&gt;<i> billions of nodes. Distance vector routing such as BGP uses may be one
</I>&gt;<i> option like Ben suggested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For now the network can easily scale to about 1 million channels [2]
</I>&gt;<i> even on very limited devices, Upgrading to another protocol at a later
</I>&gt;<i> point in time is trivial, since none of the routing information is
</I>&gt;<i> consensus critical. We have all the extension points built in to allow
</I>&gt;<i> future extensibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But briefly: scale-capable routing protocols are possible as demonstrated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by IP and thus by the internet itself. As for centralizing flow through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small number of liquidity providers, yes that does seem economically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probable, at least unless / until off-chain channel rebalancing mechanism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like the recently proposed &quot;revive&quot; protocol) come about. Bitcoin script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not currently revive-capable but Ethereum is, so either Bitcoin revive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be enabled via two-way pegged sidechain protocol with Ethereum, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even better, by a purpose-built (yet still not Turing-complete) extension
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Bitcoin script itself in the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a matter of fact, Conrad and I just published a similar technique for
</I>&gt;<i> off-chain channel rebalancing and fund re-allocation based solely on
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin [3] (major props to Conrad for the excellent writeup!). The
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility in Bitcoin exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the hubs everybody is assuming will form, I don't think they're
</I>&gt;<i> as likely to form. Creating such a hub is extremely costly since it'll
</I>&gt;<i> have to allocate sufficient funds to cover the maximum imbalance of all
</I>&gt;<i> of its channels ahead of time. Then the fees must cover the opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> cost of allocating all of those funds to channels instead of investing
</I>&gt;<i> them somewhere else. On top of that the funds will not be moved alot
</I>&gt;<i> since they serve only a small number of endpoints connected through
</I>&gt;<i> those channels, this compounds the problem of having high fees. The high
</I>&gt;<i> fees make the hub channels a really bad choice for your payments, after
</I>&gt;<i> all you were looking for small fees for your payments, right? It opens
</I>&gt;<i> up an opportunity for nodes to open bypasses that grab some of the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic and associated fees from the expensive hub.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of that being said, we should be careful about our predictions on
</I>&gt;<i> how the topology will look, I added some counter arguments to a
</I>&gt;<i> hub-and-spoke network forming, but nobody can really be sure about
</I>&gt;<i> what'll happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In either case the lightning network seems a key first step, and even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were off-chain payment rebalancing not possible for some odd reason, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightning network seems extremely valuable and scaleable - regardless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because the centralization you speak is not one that affects safety of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money supply itself, and these centralized hubs would be more dispensable /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> swappable versus the mining centralization risk that people more often talk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about in Bitcoin. Lightning network centralization, even if it persisted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somehow despite revive and future concepts, would not be an existential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risk.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rebalancing is definitely possible, even without [3], you can
</I>&gt;<i> disincentivize the use of a channel until they have been rebalanced. For
</I>&gt;<i> long term imbalance, opening another channel may be the best option
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for transaction fees, the idea is only channel setup / tear down are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required greatly reducing fees. Yes if txin fees were millions of dollars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then people could not practically penalize fraud, but that is unlikely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if txin fees made fraud claims marginally unprofitable (yet practical)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would still be ok - the judicial systems of most countries prove that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people go beyond self-interest when sufficiently ticked, a fact of human
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychology which in turn creates the incentives that support honest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business. (Also please be aware I'm not a lightning code contributor, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that team might also be doing more to address already than I thought to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mention above.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is open to speculation as well. We hope to reduce the load on the
</I>&gt;<i> on-chain network sufficiently to allow timely on-chain settlements. By
</I>&gt;<i> aggregating payments off-chain we can also aggregate the fees and then
</I>&gt;<i> use them to pay on-chain fees. So don't consider the on-chain fees for
</I>&gt;<i> your channels as your sole loss, they are paid for by payments you
</I>&gt;<i> forward. Ultimately this should encourage participants to open channels
</I>&gt;<i> that support the network as a whole, not just themselves. We are
</I>&gt;<i> building automations that should take care of this, the user won't have
</I>&gt;<i> to do anything to improve the network topology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
