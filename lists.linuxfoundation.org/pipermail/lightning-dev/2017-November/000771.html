<PRE>Rusty, your comments on BIP70 have me interested. Do you have a belief as
to why it is not used? And I assume you are largely referring to the BIP
70-72 collection? Is it a case of App devs just not incorporating the
functionality in?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the transition is kind of painful.  You can use a BOLT 11 QR code,

</I>&gt;<i> understand BOLT11 enough to extract it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they understand the BIP70 payment protocol, it could include an

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Lets imagine, that someone send me invoice. I send payment and someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the middle doesn't cooperate fast. My payment is waiting and until

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lock period lapse I don't know if my payment will be processed or not.
</I>&gt;<i> What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do then?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the worst case, yes.  It's actually two cases: one where the
</I>&gt;<i> payment has failed, and one where it has succeeded and you don't know
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's succeeded you'll get your goods (the recipient sees nothing
</I>&gt;<i> wrong), so you don't care that you have to wait for the money to be
</I>&gt;<i> deducted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it hasn't, it's almost certainly going to fail, and you can either
</I>&gt;<i> wait or try again with a new invoice (your wallet won't let to pay the
</I>&gt;<i> same one twice unless it's definitely failed).  For 1.1 you'd be able to
</I>&gt;<i> reuse the same invoice safely, as long as the merchant was honest if it
</I>&gt;<i> received two payments and rejects the second.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Am I right that this decremental time lock is strongly related with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; block confirmation time? If there would be currency that have very fast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confirmation time (like 5 seconds) then time lock period could be short
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what can potentially solve problem described in paragraph 2?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhat, but not that low, because you still need a margin to turn
