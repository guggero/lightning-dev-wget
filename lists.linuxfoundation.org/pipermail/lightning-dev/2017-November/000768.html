<PRE>Hello,

I'm a big fan of LN technology for over than one year. I have few questions
and I thing this group is the best place to ask them. Would be great if
some of you could find few minutes to answer them.

1. After LN starts, some group of users will use it, other not. If for
example, I would like to receive payment for coffee from some user, I don't
know if user uses LN or not. So, when someone buy something from me, do I
need to ask him what kind of payment he would like to use (LN or on-chain)?
The best would be, if I show him some qr code contains both public address
and LN invoice and his wallet could choose how to pay. But this cannot be
done this way, right?

2. Lets imagine, that someone send me invoice. I send payment and someone
in the middle doesn't cooperate fast. My payment is waiting and until time
lock period lapse I don't know if my payment will be processed or not. What
to do then?

3. Am I right that this decremental time lock is strongly related with
block confirmation time? If there would be currency that have very fast
confirmation time (like 5 seconds) then time lock period could be short
what can potentially solve problem described in paragraph 2?

Best Regards,
Cezary Dziemian
