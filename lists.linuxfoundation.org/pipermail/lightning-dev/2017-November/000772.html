<PRE>Thank you very much for answers. It is honor that you answered and it is
also very important for us in Poland. My friend is building Bitcoin ATMs
and off-course plan to use LN. BTW: In Poland a lot of people believe that
LN is the next big thing. We have huge pro-LN community and even have LN
whitepaper translated to polish.

So for 1.1 such scenario will not be possible?:

We have such network with such payment channel opened:

           Hub A
          /           \
Payer              Merchant
          \           /
           Hub B

Hub A and Hub B belong to the same person, who will try to cheat us. Now
Payer try to send payment through Hub A to Merchant. Hub A updates HTLC
contract with Payer for this payment but never updates HTLC contract to
Merchant so payment cannot be processed and is &quot;pending&quot;. Because payer see
that payment is pending, tries to make payment using Hub B based on the
same invoice. After Marchant reveals secret number to Hub B, Hub A also can
use it to steal funds from first pending payment.

&gt;<i> Somewhat, but not that low, because you still need a margin to turn
</I>&gt;<i> around payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How big this margin would be? If we have crypto with 5 seconds block
confirmation time, how big such timelocks could be? I quess it is hard to
answer precisely, but could you give at least estimated value?

Best Regards,
Cezary

&gt;<i> I think this might have been discussed somewhere, sometime before:
</I>&gt;<i> couldn&#8217;t we add an lightning parameter to the bitcoin: url, making the QR
</I>&gt;<i> codes backwards compatible?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. After LN starts, some group of users will use it, other not. If for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, I would like to receive payment for coffee from some user, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know if user uses LN or not. So, when someone buy something from me, do I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to ask him what kind of payment he would like to use (LN or
</I>&gt;<i> on-chain)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The best would be, if I show him some qr code contains both public
</I>&gt;<i> address
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and LN invoice and his wallet could choose how to pay. But this cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; done this way, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the transition is kind of painful. You can use a BOLT 11 QR code,
</I>&gt;<i> which can contain a fallback address, but that still requires their app
</I>&gt;<i> understand BOLT11 enough to extract it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they understand the BIP70 payment protocol, it could include an
</I>&gt;<i> alternate payment mechanism, but it seems nobody actually uses this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Lets imagine, that someone send me invoice. I send payment and someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the middle doesn't cooperate fast. My payment is waiting and until
</I>&gt;<i> time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lock period lapse I don't know if my payment will be processed or not.
</I>&gt;<i> What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do then?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the worst case, yes. It's actually two cases: one where the
</I>&gt;<i> payment has failed, and one where it has succeeded and you don't know
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's succeeded you'll get your goods (the recipient sees nothing
</I>&gt;<i> wrong), so you don't care that you have to wait for the money to be
</I>&gt;<i> deducted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it hasn't, it's almost certainly going to fail, and you can either
</I>&gt;<i> wait or try again with a new invoice (your wallet won't let to pay the
</I>&gt;<i> same one twice unless it's definitely failed). For 1.1 you'd be able to
</I>&gt;<i> reuse the same invoice safely, as long as the merchant was honest if it
</I>&gt;<i> received two payments and rejects the second.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Am I right that this decremental time lock is strongly related with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; block confirmation time? If there would be currency that have very fast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confirmation time (like 5 seconds) then time lock period could be short
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what can potentially solve problem described in paragraph 2?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhat, but not that low, because you still need a margin to turn
</I>&gt;<i> around payments. In practice, if payments are so unreliable that you
</I>&gt;<i> have to worry about this case, then something's horribly wrong!
</I>&gt;<i>
