I'm a routing node operator and have been for over a year. I've been 
wanting this feature (plus negative fees) for a long time now.

Reason 1:
For peers that tend to be liquidity sources (i.e. the liquidity tends to 
be all on my side), there's currently no way to keep a channel in 
balance with fees. All I can do is set a zero outbound fee and usually 
that's not good enough :/. A high inbound fee would discourage payments 
through that route.

Reason 2:
Not all inbound traffic is created equally. If two different peers wish 
to route through me to the same outbound peer, I may value the two 
forwards differently depending on who the sender is. E.g.

A-&gt;C where A is a great peer that I frequently route payments to
B-&gt;C where B is a peer that I rarely route payments to, or otherwise 
wish to preserve more inbound from

I'm much happier routing A-&gt;C than I am routing B-&gt;C, but there's 
currently no way of expressing this to the market through fees. All I 
can do is htlc-intercept B-&gt;C and reject it, but this damages my 
reputation obviously.

Reason 3:
Greater expressivity in fee-setting generally allows markets to push 
more flows off-chain without having to loop or open new channels. While 
I think negative fees would be more impactful for this, inbound fees are 
helpful as well. Combining negative + inbound fees is where the real 
magic would happen IMO.
