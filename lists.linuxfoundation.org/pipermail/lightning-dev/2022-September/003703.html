<PRE>Good morning aj, Rene, and all,

So let me discuss a little more about how I model the forwarding nodes.

Forwarding nodes want to maximize profit.

Forwarding nodes sell liquidity.

If a forwarding node runs out of stock of liquidity (i.e. their channel is unbalanced against the direction a payment request fails) they earn 0 profit.

If a forwarding node finds a liquidity being sold at a lower price than they would be able to sell it, they will buy out the cheaper stock and then resell it at a higher price.
This is called rebalancing.
In particular:

* Other economic activity is likely to be &quot;has to happen at a particular time&quot;.
  * The intuition here is that people are not going to pay until they become interested in purchasing a product, and only then will they actually send out an HTLC.
* Rebalances (i.e. hostile takeover bids of cheap liquidity) are &quot;can happen at any time&quot;.
* Thus, rebalances are likely to occur &quot;first&quot;, because they can happen at any time, and can be done right now, whereas payments will need to wait until somebody somewhere is interested in paying.
* Thus, channels advertising low fees are likely to have their liquidity bought out by patient forwarding nodes.

The above implies that any &quot;payment size distribution&quot; can, and *will*, be manipulated by forwarding nodes out to buy out cheap liquidity.
If you introduce an artificial impediment and say &quot;I will only accept payment sizes below N millisats&quot;, and then go &quot;I will #zerofeerouting guy&quot;, then a forwarding node will just split their rebalance into quanta of N millisats and make a spike in the payment size distribution and drain your channel anyway, so that they can turn around and resell the liquidity at a higher price later.

This also suggests to me that fees being paid by out-of-band means (i.e. &quot;monetizing outside of the Lightning forwarding fees&quot;) is likely to fail, because forwarding nodes will exploit that and do a hostile takeover of the cheap liquidity.
i.e. #zerofeerouting will never be a reliable forwarding node, because all the other forwarding nodes will be taking their liquidity for cheap long before you think to make a payment through them.

Rebalances cannot be differentiated from payments unless you force publication of source and destination (and even if you forced that, people can lie about who the *real* source and *real* destination are, so why bother).
And rebalances are going to target cheap liquidity and will avoid any non-fee valves you impose.

Invisible hand wins, yo.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
