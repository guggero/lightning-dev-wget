<PRE>Dear Lisa and lightning developers,

thank you for your contribution and ideas to the problem of increasing
reliability to the payment deliver process by having balanced channels and
providing liquidity where necessary. This is at least how I understand your
intentions of the proposal. I will just add a few notes and remarks.

1. I think negative fees are certainly an interesting idea that is
worthwhile to investigate. Mathematically speaking it is kind of strange to
cut the routing_costs at 0 and to restrict market participants from
selecting / offering negative fees. In particular min cost flow solvers
should not have any problems with negative fees. I also like the fact that
we would have another reason to deprecate the base fee. However I am
uncertain if negative fees may introduce other problems and unintended side
effects in particular with strategic behavior of routing nodes. The biggest
issue I see is if negative fees would produce a negative cost cycle.
Obviously everyone would try to cancel such a cycle and earn some arbitrage
by moving liquidity. While the first node may be successful I assume nodes
will not directly update fees / propagate gossip which would basically
create a lot of traffic requests to nodes in the negative cost cycle even
though there is no liquidity in that fee band left.

2. I like the fact that fee rate cards would produce a piece wise linear
cost function which should also be convex (assuming the rates increase in
every band). Assuming we move forward with fee rate cards we should make it
an explicit requirement that the fees in higher bands must not decrease,
which seems like a very sane requirement. (Is it?) However I am not sure if
the virtualization of the channel into 4 smaller channels as ZmnSCPxj
suggested to think of it is beneficial for the network. Intuitively (I have
no formal proof or simulation for this yet) I agree with the people who
voiced their concern that this may just overall increase payment latency
and decrease reliability (because selfish senders might start with the
cheapest or cheaper bands). My concern might be mitigated if we started to
share two bits of information about the liquidity in a channel (either
network wide) or as I propose in PR 780 within the friend of the friend
network [1]. In your other mail of this thread [2] you referred to PR 780
and noted that it may be worthwhile to investigate this. I agree and I
invite you to help me doing so.

3. After having privately discussed my recent blog article [3] to set up
valves via `htlc_maximum_msat` with a few node operators and having heard
their thoughts I realized that the idea of fee rate cards might actually be
even more powerful if not used to divide the channel capacity but rather
have various fee rate cards for various `htlc_maximum_msat` values. The
Idea is quite simple: If you have a certain drain on a channel and install
a valve to do flow control you could still offer someone to break the valve
open and get their large payment through and deplete your channel if they
would pay premium for it. Again without formal proof or simulation it is my
intuition that this is a more natural and less complicated design and would
achieve two things which both seem beneficial for the network and its
participants:

3a) Node operators would not loose out the opportunity to route large
payments when setting up valves. The main concern I had from some node
operators about setting up valves was that they know that some channels
have not many forwarding requests but usually rather large ones. Setting up
a valve may not be in their interest as it would be too restrictive. With
various fee rates for various payment sizes they could still allow large
payments (Similar to your proposal where payments that are larger than 25%
of the capacity also cannot be in the first band of the fees)

3b) In contrast to your proposal the sending nodes would not have to have
the doubt in which band the channel currently is and save on guessing. If
the amount is small enough they would usually get the cheaper fee rate but
if they want to move a lot of liquidity they have to offer a premium. I
think this would also produce a convex cost function but reduce the
guessing game and lower failed attempts and latency. It could still happen
that especially for a larger amount that not enough liquidity would be in
the channel and even a small payment could fail (as could happen these
days). Both could happen within your proposal too.

So while I find your proposal interesting I would love to investigate a bit
more how it interacts with other proposals and if we could make your and
other proposals even stronger by combining some of the other ideas.

with kind Regards Rene

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been talking about them for a bit[^1], now[^2], but here's a more formal proposal for fee ratecards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spec PR + implementation to come.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## What is a fee ratecard?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A ratecard is a set of four values, positive or negative, that price different
</I>&gt;<i> bands of available liquidity for a channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A ratecard replaces the current `fee_proportional_millionths` and `fee_base_msat` currently used to calculate the owed fees for forwarding a payment on the
</I>&gt;<i> lightning network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, with ratecards, a channel operator may specify four different
</I>&gt;<i> rates for a channel's liquidity, that will automatically be updated
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the current channel capacity. The four capacity bands are fixed
</I>&gt;<i> at 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100%.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, all payments are priced equally. Fee ratecards update this such that
</I>&gt;<i> payments can be priced differently, depending on the current available
</I>&gt;<i> capacity in a channel. This allows node operators to dynamically price
</I>&gt;<i> their liquidity, without needing to continually issue gossip updates as
</I>&gt;<i> the balance changes (which may leak payment flow timing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Spec Changes + Implementation Notes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the `channel_update` gossip message, we add a TLV with one defined type, `ratecard`. The ratecard contains 4 16-bit signed integers, one for each quarter of channel capacity. (0-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-100%).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> 1. `tlv_stream`: `channel_update_tlvs`
</I>&gt;<i> 2. types:
</I>&gt;<i>     1. type: 1 (`ratecard`)
</I>&gt;<i>     2. data:
</I>&gt;<i>         * [`s16`:`fee_basis_0_25`]
</I>&gt;<i>         * [`s16`:`fee_basis_26_50`]
</I>&gt;<i>         * [`s16`:`fee_basis_51_75`]
</I>&gt;<i>         * [`s16`:`fee_basis_76_100`]
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a node is advertising a `ratecard` in their `channel_update` for that channel, a routing node SHOULD pick the rate to pay based on their current guess of the channel's capacity as well as priority for the payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a payment is high priority, it is recommended to pay at the highest feeband,
</I>&gt;<i> to ensure delivery (if possible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On payment failure, the response is the same (you return a copy of the `channel_update` in the onion). You MAY give an additional hint as to what the current
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable feerate is for a payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the feerate card entry is set, the rates there take precedence over the
</I>&gt;<i> `fee_base_msat` and the `fee_proportional_millionths`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The `feerate` card effectively removes the ability to set a `fee_base_msat`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To minimize payment routing failure, it is recommended to set the
</I>&gt;<i> `fee_proportional_millionths` to the same rate as the highest `ratecard`
</I>&gt;<i> rate. (Most likely the `ratecard`.`fee_basis_0_25`).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that `ratecards` unit is in basis points, not millionths. As basis points
</I>&gt;<i> are 1/10,000, they're 100x less than the same value expressed as millionths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A `basis_point` value of 5 is a fee of 5msat on a 10k msat payment.
</I>&gt;<i> - A `fee_proportional_millionths` of 500 is a fee of 5msat on a 10k msat payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current expected price for sats to be pushed to the other side of the
</I>&gt;<i> channel is to be priced by the lowest ratecard capacity band that that payment
</I>&gt;<i> will push the balance into.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, if a payment moves 50k through a 100k channel which is currently
</I>&gt;<i> at a total available capacity of 75k sats (which means it'll move the capacity
</I>&gt;<i> from 75k to 25k), that payment will be expected to pay a rate equal to the
</I>&gt;<i> 0-25% band, as it'll push the available capacity into the 0-25% range.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using this rule, HTLCs consuming significant portions of a channel's
</I>&gt;<i> total capacity are more likely to pay higher fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ### Motivation and Rationale
</I>&gt;<i> At the last in-person spec meeting, it was noted that channel capacity is
</I>&gt;<i> often of variable value depending on the amount of capacity currently
</I>&gt;<i> available in that channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was also noted that we'd like to allow node operators to experiment
</I>&gt;<i> with negative fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can't easily allow for negative feerates with our current gossip messages,
</I>&gt;<i> as it would give gossip an economic value which may have an adverse impact
</I>&gt;<i> on the ability of nodes to stay up to date with the current lightning channel
</I>&gt;<i> topology; it also stands to greatly increase the volume of gossip
</I>&gt;<i> updates issued by any one node, which should scale with payment volume,
</I>&gt;<i> as nodes update their gossip to change their current fees on any one channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that some nodes already automatically update their channel fees based on
</I>&gt;<i> the available capacity in a channel; fee ratecards should be a more succinct
</I>&gt;<i> way for node operators to express more fine grained prices of their existing
</I>&gt;<i> capacity, with a much reduced bandwidth burden.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ### Feerate Cards, Frequently Asked Questions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### Why four evenly spaced buckets? Why not X function?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Expressibility
</I>&gt;<i> 	Fees are calculated by the node creating the route for a payment, using
</I>&gt;<i> 	parameters set by the channel node operator. These paramters must be
</I>&gt;<i> 	communicated via gossip to every node, and then used as inputs to the
</I>&gt;<i> 	routing function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Parameters need to be uniform and well understood such that
</I>&gt;<i> 	routing algorithm designers can make efficient use of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 	
</I>&gt;<i> 	Four buckets is wide enough such that payment should
</I>&gt;<i> 	be able to find/pick a current channel capacity with good
</I>&gt;<i> 	probability, yet hopefully expressive enough for routing
</I>&gt;<i> 	operators to be able to price their available liquidity
</I>&gt;<i> 	with sufficient granularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Four evenly spaced buckets also make it much easier to
</I>&gt;<i> 	reason about information leakage (binary search).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Predictability for payment success.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Feerate cards don't introduce any new risk to payment failure,
</I>&gt;<i> 	as the current fee rates of a channel may currently differ
</I>&gt;<i> 	from a node's gossip information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Rather, feerate cards offer a way for your routing algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> 	to dynamically decide on what level of capacity it estimates
</I>&gt;<i> 	the channel to be at, and its tolerance for failures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### Won't this leak my channel balance?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At most, feerate buckets reduce the total number of payment attempts
</I>&gt;<i> required to find an exact channel balance by 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It does, however, provide a much lower 'cost of capital' mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> for discovering which band of payment is likely to succeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, to discover if a 100k channel has capacity for a 75k sat payment,
</I>&gt;<i> you'd need 75k sats of available liquidity in the node leading up to
</I>&gt;<i> that channel (or 25k in the opposite direction) from your probe node, in
</I>&gt;<i> order to discover if that bucket is available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This ties up available liquidity along the entire probe route.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With feerate cards, you could do a 1k sat payment at each feerate card
</I>&gt;<i> fee band, and discover the approximate bucket without tying up
</I>&gt;<i> as much of your own own outband capital.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This makes probing more feasible for any node that wants to make a payment,
</I>&gt;<i> while reducing the capital tied up to discern the same amount of information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### More data in the channel_update message! Just what we need, more gossip.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's anticipated that feerate cards will greatly reduce the number of
</I>&gt;<i> `channel_update`s issued by a node, by allowing node operators to dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> price their liquidity by available capacity via a single, static
</I>&gt;<i> `channel_update`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This should reduce or remove the need to rebroadcast a `channel_update` when a
</I>&gt;<i> channel's capacity changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### How do negative fees work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Astute readers may notice that the proposed feerate card bands can be expressed
</I>&gt;<i> as negative numbers. This allows node operators to price the liquidity
</I>&gt;<i> available in their channel at a discount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a good way to think about the impact a negative fee will
</I>&gt;<i> have on your channel balances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A feerate of 5 basis points means that, in order to push 10k sats from
</I>&gt;<i> one of your channel balances to the peer, another of yours must push
</I>&gt;<i> you 10,005 sats. This means you always need more inbound than outbound
</I>&gt;<i> in order to route a payment (unless you're using zero fees, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> you'd need an equal amount).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Negative fees reverse this. At -5 basis points, you'd only need to receive 9,995
</I>&gt;<i> on an inbound channel to cause you to push out 10k sats. This allows you
</I>&gt;<i> to reallocate your inbound capacity at a slight discount to the party
</I>&gt;<i> who's responsible for moving the capital.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### What happened to payment base fees?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They're going away (they do not work with negative rates).
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully ratecards will give you enough expressivity to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> good rates for your channel capacity without them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ### Credits
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This proposal is a marriage of Clara Shikleman's push to start thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about negative fees, and ZmnSCPxj's comments on the variability of
</I>&gt;<i> value of a channel's liquidity based on current capacity.
