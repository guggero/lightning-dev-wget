That's a very easy to understand explanation of how to use the system, 
thanks!

My concern is about pathfinding algorithms which depend on unscalable 
data collection (e.g. frequent whole network probing).  If such an 
algorithm performs much better than those algorithms which depend on 
scalable data collection (e.g. receiving gossip), then the network may 
grow to depend on the centralized entities performing the data 
collection to the detriment of its robustness and its participants' 
independence.

Try-and-try-another-path is somewhat problematic in this regard since, 
even with no additional action like probing, entities which send many 
payments will likely perform significantly better than entities which 
send few payments owing to the high-frequency spenders gaining more 
knowledge about which channels and amounts recently worked or did not.  
It seems to me that a more idealized system would only rarely have 
forwarding failures so that high frequency spenders wouldn't receive 
much more information than low frequency spenders.  To that regard, fee 
ratecards feels like a small step in the wrong direction because 
modeling one channel as four separate channels further normalizes 
failure and so further moves the system towards centralized dependency.  
That said, as you mentioned in a previous post[1], I agree ratecards is 
better than frequently issuing new channel updates with modified fees.

Thanks,

-Dave
