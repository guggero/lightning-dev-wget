<PRE>Thank you very much. These were very clarifying answers and ramblings.

&gt;<i> Good morning fiatjaf,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No. My question was more like why does Alice decide to build a route
</I>that for through T1 and RT2 and not only through one trampoline router she
knows.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Alice only always used one trampoline node, then the trampoline node
</I>can assume the next hop is always the payee, and thus record who the payee
is (eroding privacy).
&gt;<i> If Alice uses two, then a trampoline node would have a 50/50 chance of
</I>knowing who the final payee is, reducing the privacy erosion.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, onion routing over Tor typically passes through 3 &quot;trampoline&quot;
</I>nodes before going to the actual site being accessed.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That makes sense you me in the context of ZmnSCPxj's virtual space idea,
</I>but not necessarily in the current network conditions. You also said we're
going to need some hierarchy, but what it's that? Is it required?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe in the future we will see a public network that is too large to
</I>fit on most devices available to most people.
&gt;<i> We may or may not want to have such an enormous network, but the cost of
</I>advertising a public channel is the same as the cost of creating a
non-public channel, thus there is no incentive for random end-user nodes to
*not* publish their channels, and incentive to publish (there is a tiny but
non-zero chance of being routed through, especially as local-area
specializations like JIT-Routing get implemented).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, I believe it is eventually required that we hierarchicalize how we
</I>store information, with a &quot;myopic&quot; detailed channel map and a &quot;rough&quot;
global map with just trampoline-payee association mappings.
&gt;<i> I think it is best for each payer to define its own hierarchy or split,
</I>preferentially with some random component.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One might consider, however, that my ramblings are too indefinite and it
</I>would be better to see the network as it evolves.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
