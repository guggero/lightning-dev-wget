<PRE>Good morning Bastien,

&gt;<i> &gt; Most solutions to the network flow problem seem to require an accurate view of flows at each node, which we do not have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting, but for the first hop (local channels) we have the exact balance available for sending, and for next hops we can consider the channels
</I>&gt;<i> balanced (with a random perturbation of X%). The combination of that and&#160;retries could provide interesting results (I plan on testing that on&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> realistic simulations of the network, I can't know for sure if this will work until then).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first implementation of MPP for eclair uses an algorithm similar to flocking.
</I>&gt;<i> I think your last suggestion of using something similar to `permuteroute` can be interesting to try too.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll give that a shot if we're not satisfied with the results of the flocking implementation. Is it what you plan on doing for MPP in c-lightning?
</I>
Original plan was to derive some kind of `getmultiroute` that does a single graph scan and somehow generates multiple paths, but I kept finding problems in my naive implementations.
I never got around to searching for existing algorithms of the needed specifications of getting multiple &quot;good&quot; paths.

So maybe `permuteroute` is one idea for implementing multipath we can try to use.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
