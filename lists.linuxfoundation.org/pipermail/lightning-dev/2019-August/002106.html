<PRE>Good morning fiatjaf,

This is a good question, I'm glad you asked.

As ZmnSCPxj points out, Alice doesn't know. By not syncing the full network
graph, Alice has to accept
&quot;being in the dark&quot; for some decisions. She is merely hoping that RT2 *can
find a route* to Bob. Note that
it's quite easy to help Alice make informed decision by proving routing
hints in the invoice and in gossip
messages (which we already do for &quot;normal&quot; routing).

The graph today is strongly connected, so it's quite a reasonable
assumption (and Alice can easily retry
with another choice of trampoline node if the first one fails - just like
we do today with normal payments).

I fully agree with ZmnSCPxj though that in the future this might not be
true anymore. When/if the network
becomes too large we will likely lose its strongly connected nature. When
that happens, the Lightning
Network will need some kind of hierarchical / packet switched routing
architecture and we won't require
trampoline nodes to know the whole network graph and be able to route to
mostly anyone.
I argue that trampoline routing is a first step towards enabling that. It's
a good engineering trade-off between
ease of implementation and deployment, fixing a problem we have today and
enabling future scaling for
problems we'll have tomorrow. It's somewhat easy once we have trampoline
payments to evolve that to a
system closer to the internet's packet switching infrastructure, so we'll
deal with that once the need for it
becomes obvious.

Does that answer your question?

Cheers,
Bastien

&gt;<i> Good morning fiatjaf,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I proposed before that we could institute a rule where nodes are mapped to
</I>&gt;<i> some virtual space, and nodes should preferably retain the part of the
</I>&gt;<i> network graph that connects itself to those nodes near to it in this
</I>&gt;<i> virtual space (and possibly prefer to channel to those nodes).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus Alice might **not** know that some route exists between T1 and T2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> T1 itself might not know of a route from itself to T2.
</I>&gt;<i> But if T1 knows a route to T1.5, and it knows that T1.5 is nearer to T2
</I>&gt;<i> than to itself in the virtual space, it can **try** to route through T1.5
</I>&gt;<i> in the hope T1.5 knows a route from itself to T2.
</I>&gt;<i> This can be done if T1 can remove itself from the trampoline route and
</I>&gt;<i> replace itself with T1.5, offerring in exchange some of the fee to T1.5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other ways of knowing some distillation of the public network without
</I>&gt;<i> remembering the channel level details are also possible.
</I>&gt;<i> My recent pointlessly long spam email for example has a section on

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Good morning list,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I realized that trampoline routing has only been briefly described to
</I>&gt;<i> this list (credits to cdecker and pm47 for laying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; out the foundations). I just published an updated PR [1] and want to
</I>&gt;<i> take this opportunity to present the high level
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; view here and the parts that need a concept ACK and more feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Trampoline routing is conceptually quite simple. Alice wants to send a
</I>&gt;<i> payment to Bob, but she doesn't know a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; route to get there because Alice only keeps a small area of the
</I>&gt;<i> routing table locally (Alice has a crappy phone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; damn it Alice sell some satoshis and buy a real phone). However, Alice
</I>&gt;<i> has a few trampoline nodes in her
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; friends-of-friends and knows some trampoline nodes outside of her
</I>&gt;<i> local area (but she doesn't know how to reach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; them). Alice would like to send a payment to a trampoline node she can
</I>&gt;<i> reach and defer calculation of the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the route to that node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The onion routing part is very simple now that we have variable-length
</I>&gt;<i> onion payloads (thanks again cdecker!).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Just like russian dolls, we simply put a small onion inside a big
</I>&gt;<i> onion. And the HTLC management forwards very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; naturally.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's always simpler with an example. Let's imagine that Alice can
</I>&gt;<i> reach three trampoline nodes: T1, T2 and T3.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; She also knows the details of many remote trampoline nodes that she
</I>&gt;<i> cannot reach: RT1, RT2, RT3 and RT4.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Alice selects T1 and RT2 to use as trampoline hops. She builds a small
</I>&gt;<i> onion that describes the following route:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Alice -&gt; T1 -&gt; RT2 -&gt; Bob
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; She finds a route to T1 and builds a normal onion to send a payment to
</I>&gt;<i> T1:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Alice -&gt; N1 -&gt; N2 -&gt; T1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the payload for T1, Alice puts the small trampoline onion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When T1 receives the payment, he is able to peel one layer of the
</I>&gt;<i> trampoline onion and discover that he must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; forward the payment to RT2. T1 finds a route to RT2 and builds a
</I>&gt;<i> normal onion to send a payment to RT2:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; T1 -&gt; N3 -&gt; RT2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the payload for RT2, T1 puts the peeled small trampoline onion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When RT2 receives the payment, he is able to peel one layer of the
</I>&gt;<i> trampoline onion and discover that he must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; forward the payment to Bob. RT2 finds a route to Bob and builds a
</I>&gt;<i> normal onion to send a payment:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; RT2 -&gt; N4 -&gt; N5 -&gt; Bob
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the payload for Bob, RT2 puts the peeled small trampoline onion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When Bob receives the payment, he is able to peel the last layer of
</I>&gt;<i> the trampoline onion and discover that he is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the final recipient, and fulfills the payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Alice has successfully sent a payment to Bob deferring route
</I>&gt;<i> calculation to some chosen trampoline nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That part was simple and (hopefully) not controversial, but it left
</I>&gt;<i> out some important details:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1.  How do trampoline nodes specify their fees and cltv requirements?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2.  How does Alice sync the fees and cltv requirements for her remote
</I>&gt;<i> trampoline nodes?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To answer 1., trampoline nodes needs to estimate a fee and cltv that
</I>&gt;<i> allows them to route to (almost) any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trampoline node. This is likely going to increase the fees paid by
</I>&gt;<i> end-users, but they can't eat their cake and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have it too: by not syncing the whole network, users are trading fees
</I>&gt;<i> for ease of use and payment reliability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To answer 2., we can re-use the existing gossip infrastructure to
</I>&gt;<i> exchange a new node_update message that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; contains the trampoline fees and cltv. However Alice doesn't want to
</I>&gt;<i> receive every network update because she
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't have the bandwidth to support it (damn it again Alice, upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> your mobile plan). My suggestion is to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; create a filter system (similiar to BIP37) where Alice sends gossip
</I>&gt;<i> filters to her peers, and peers only forward to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Alice updates that match these filters. This doesn't have the issues
</I>&gt;<i> BIP37 has for Bitcoin because it has a cost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for Alice: she has to open a channel (and thus lock funds) to get a
</I>&gt;<i> connection to a peer. Peers can refuse to serve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; filters if they are too expensive to compute, but the filters I
</I>&gt;<i> propose in the PR are very cheap (a simple xor or a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; node distance comparison).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If you're interested in the technical details, head over to [1].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would really like to get feedback from this list on the concept
</I>&gt;<i> itself, and especially on the gossip and fee estimation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; parts. If you made it that far, I'm sure you have many questions and
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions ;).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
