<PRE>&gt;<i>So would `push_msat`; until confirmed deeply the channel opening can still
</I>be cancelled by double-spending and it would be foolhardy to deliver the
product until the channel is deeply confirmed to be opened.

Okay so there's 2 situations here I'd like to explore:

1. Bob -&gt; routing node -&gt; Me

2. Bob -&gt; Me

*Scenario 1*
If Bob pays the invoice and the routing node opens a payment channel and
pushes sats to me, you could stipulate that the routing node isn't able to
fully take ownership of the sats until 6 confirmations potentially via Hodl
Invoices (by the time the routing nodes channel with pushed payments
confirms with mine).  But I could still make LN payments instantly through
the routing node because the routing node just needs to wait until the 6
confirmations and settle all accounts after the fact.

*Scenario 2*
Bob and I know each other so if channel disappears, it's basically the same
situation with Thor's instant channel.  But we could completely remove
scenario 2 and only allow routing nodes to open channels to me as long as
Bob makes the payment.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;Further, while it involves fees, it does give you control over what

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What disadvantages do you see over this proposal and say something like
</I>&gt;<i> autopilot?  Or do you just prefer manual channel management overall?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A current and practical way to set up incoming liquidity would be to
</I>&gt;<i> take some onchain funds, create a channel to a high-uptime node on the
</I>&gt;<i> network (just run an autopilot), then use a submarine swap (i.e. pay
</I>&gt;<i> offchain funds to buy onchain funds).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Then you can reuse the same onchain funds over and over to make more
</I>&gt;<i> liquidity until the submarine swap provider runs out of onchain funds or
</I>&gt;<i> you have sufficient liquidity or your money has been drained by the fees
</I>&gt;<i> involved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; While this requires onchain funds, presumably as a new business or
</I>&gt;<i> merchant you will have capital in some form before starting your business.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The most sensible way to store and transport financial capital is, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, Bitcoin, thus you already have what is needed to start this, you
</I>&gt;<i> simply have to do it before you perform other operations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Further, while it involves fees, it does give you control over what
</I>&gt;<i> nodes you make channels with, and would be a good investment in your future

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi. I'd like to propose a way for instant inbound liquidity to be
</I>&gt;<i> automated via invoices and would appreciate your feedback.  It's similar to
</I>&gt;<i> Thor's instant channel but this proposal would only be valuable if it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a standard across all lightning implementations and wallets.  It
</I>&gt;<i> won't work if it's limited to just one Lightning wallet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Proposal: Automated Inbound Liquidity With Invoices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; For Who: Full Lightning Network nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Problem: Waiting for inbound liquidity as channel establishes when
</I>&gt;<i> you first come online and want to receive a LN payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Solution: Embedding the node uri of the invoice creator, along with
</I>&gt;<i> amount to be routed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  Bob wants to send me 100,000 sats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  My node just came online and has 0 inbound liquidity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.  I create an invoice for 100,000 sats.  My LN node recognizes I
</I>&gt;<i> have 0 inbound liquidity so my wallet also embeds my URI in the invoice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 4.  Bob&#8217;s wallet sees an invoice + uri.  Maybe even tries to route.
</I>&gt;<i> When it doesn&#8217;t see anything, it auto opens a channel + pushes 100,000 sat
</I>&gt;<i> payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 5.  I now own and can spend 100,000 sats instantly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Considerations:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   This auto establishing of channels and pushing payments isn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> for all LN nodes.  Just routing nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   Bob doesn&#8217;t need to be the one to establish the channel.  He can
</I>&gt;<i> push the information down the line until a node dedicated to routing is
</I>&gt;<i> found.  The routing node can then be the one to establish the channel with
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   Certain specifics need to be flushed out such as the size of
</I>&gt;<i> Bob&#8217;s channel.  Right now I think Bob can manually set the size of the
</I>&gt;<i> channels to be established on his end.  Should be smaller channels at
</I>&gt;<i> first.  If the person gets paid again, just establish another channel
</I>&gt;<i> towards the same node if there isn't enough capacity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   Routing nodes who provide this service can charge a premium.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   Bob, as a liquidity provider, won't cheat against himself so I
</I>&gt;<i> can make LN payments instantly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   The beauty behind this proposal is that I can receive a payment
</I>&gt;<i> instantly, I can send payments instantly, and that it hides everything from
</I>&gt;<i> me as an end user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; -   Can possibly be extended to neutrino LN wallets if they are
</I>&gt;<i> public.
</I>&gt;<i>
