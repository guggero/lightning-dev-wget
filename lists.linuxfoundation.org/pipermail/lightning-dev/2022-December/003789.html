<PRE>Hi Matt,



&gt;<i> Indeed, it may be explainable, but its still somewhat painful, I think. I
</I>&gt;<i> do wonder if we can enable
</I>&gt;<i> probing via a non-HTLC message and do immediate pre-send-probing to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> paying upfront fees on
</I>&gt;<i> paths that will fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This could be a good idea, but I think that it shouldn't be a prerequisite
for unconditional fees.


&gt;<i> I don't think so - today there are at least three different routing goals
</I>&gt;<i> to maximize - (a) privacy,
</I>&gt;<i> (b) fees, (c) success rate. For &quot;live&quot; payment, you probably want to lean
</I>&gt;<i> towards optimizing for
</I>&gt;<i> success rate, and many nodes do today by default. But that isn't the full
</I>&gt;<i> story - many nodes do
</I>&gt;<i> background rebalancing and they prefer to take paths which optimize for
</I>&gt;<i> fees, trying many paths they
</I>&gt;<i> think are likely to fail to see if they can rebalance with lower fees. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think we should tell
</I>&gt;<i> those users/use-cases that they aren't allowed to do that or they're doing
</I>&gt;<i> something &quot;wrong&quot; - I
</I>&gt;<i> think choosing to optimize for fees (or, in the future, privacy) is an
</I>&gt;<i> important thing to allow, and
</I>&gt;<i> ideally make as reliable as possible, without charging extra for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that fees and privacy are important, and play a bigger role in
transactions that are not very time sensitive. That being said, locking up
funds in channels knowing that with a decent probability the nodes along
the route won't be compensated at all is not great. If it's on a small
scale, we don't have to think about this as &quot;wrong&quot;. The sender is asking
the nodes along the route to provide a service (lock up funds and provide
information about liquidity) and is paying a small fee for it.

Speaking of &quot;wrong&quot; - on Monday we'll be discussing further parameters to
be considered in reputation schemes. I think that your input will be very
valuable.
