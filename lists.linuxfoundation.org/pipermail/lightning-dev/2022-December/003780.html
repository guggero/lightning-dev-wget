<PRE>This subject makes a strong argument, along with the onion routed messaging part of Bolt 12 for an independent, Lightning funded onion routing relay network, over which all such kinds of traffic and security can be provided.

I'm working on such a project, which will be initially built to support LND/BTCD/Neutrino: <A HREF="https://github.com/Indra-Labs/indra&#160;One">https://github.com/Indra-Labs/indra&#160;One</A> of its key innovations is a mechanism for path tracing, which enables the deduction of likely nodes that are currently not functioning correctly or malicious or offline or congested, via a process of deduction, while keeping the client originating traffic hidden from nodes in the path.

Channels running across this overlay network would not be possible to jam and with many nodes a lot of traffic would pass through opaque tunnels, which would make jamming harder. The payment scheme in it also might work as a full solution to the adding of a cost against attempts to jam channels. My current idea for reputation is just a simple measure of client success ranking nodes by how recent and reliable they are, creating a loose consensus on the network of which nodes are better connected and dependable. Because it will use a median/zip merging process for evaluating the nodes it is hard for an adversary to damage the reputation of good nodes without also having to run a lot of nodes and for those nodes to also develop a good reputation.&#160;

Anyway, just some thoughts on the subject, not sure how useful or correct they are at this point.
