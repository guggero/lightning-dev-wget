<PRE>Hi Greg,

&gt;<i> Feel free to assume that we've worked around mempool pinning for all of
</I>&gt;<i> these discussions, otherwise we're pretty hosed regardless. I'm implicitly
</I>&gt;<i> assuming V3+ephemeral anchors, which disallows batched bumps, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> You'll need to give some room for &quot;slippage&quot;, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> shared_delay/2*shared_delay is going to end up dominating UX in any
</I>&gt;<i> non-layered scheme.
</I>
I think I was making the same assumption of V3+ephemeral anchors, and
effectively disabling batching removes the known case of &quot;commitment
cat-and-mouse&quot; attack, where a counterparty goes to confirm the commitment
one by one to break the validity of the common CPFP. However, I wonder if
there is not another attack case, see my other &quot;update overflow&quot; mail, and
I don't think it qualifies as a pinning here!

&gt;<i> This architecture doesn't suffer from 2*self_delay, and each transition
</I>&gt;<i> aside from Slow/Settle/SX.y has no relative timelock so that relative
</I>&gt;<i> timelock is all that matters. It does introduce a watchtower cycle, so
</I>it's
&gt;<i> not longer a one-shot architecture, or even k-shot exactly, it ends up
</I>&gt;<i> looking like vanilla eltoo for that single path.
</I>
Here I think my understanding is aligned, the watchtower cycle ends up
looking more like the update phase of vanilla eltoo.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the eltoo/chia variant, from my (quick) understanding, the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> innovation aimed for is the limitation of the publication of eltoo states
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more than once by a counterparty, by introducing a cryptographic puzzle,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where the witness can be produced once and only once ? I would say you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might need the inheritance of the updated scriptpubkey across the chain of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eltoo states, with a TLUV-like mechanism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The basic idea is &quot;if it's a two party channel with just Alice and Bob,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then if Alice starts a unilateral close, then she's already had her say,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; so it's only Bob's opinion that matters from now on, and he should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; able to act immediately&quot;, and once it's only Bob's opinion that matters,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you can simplify a bunch of things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From my understanding, assuming Eltoo paper terminology, Alice can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publish an update K transaction, and then after Bob can publish an update
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transaction K&lt;N or Alice can publish the settlement transaction N, or Bob
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can publish an update transaction N. The main advantage of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> construction I can see is a strict bound on the shared_delay encumbered in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the on-chain publication of the channel ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; fast forwards: we might want to allow our channel partner
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to immediately rely on a new state we propose without needing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; round-trip delay -- this potentially makes forwarding payments much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; faster (though with some risk of locking the funds up, if you do a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; fast forward to someone who's gone offline)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IIRC, there has already been a &quot;fast-forward&quot; protocol upgrade proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on update-turn in the LN-penalty paradigm [0]. I think reducing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> latency of HTLC propagation across payment paths would constitute a UX
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improvement, especially a link-level update mechanism upgrade deployment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be incentivized by routing algorithms starting to penalize routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hops HTLC relay latency. What is unclear is the additional risk of locking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the funds up. If you don't receive acknowledgement the fast forward state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has been received, you should still be able to exit with the state N-1 ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the fast-forward trade-off might sound acceptable, with time you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might expect reliable routing hops in the core of the graph, and flappy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spokes at the edge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doubled delays: once we publish the latest state we can, we want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; be able to claim the funds immediately after to_self_delay expires;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; however if our counterparty has signatures for a newer state than we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; do (which will happen if it was fast forwarded), they could post that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; state shortly before to_self_delay expires, potentially increasing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the total delay to 2*to_self_delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While the 2*to_self_delay sounds the maximum time delay in the state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publication scenario where the cheating counterparty publishes a old state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the honest counterparty publishes the latest one, there could be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case where the cheating counterparty broadcast chain of old states, up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mempool's `limitancestorcount`. However, this chain of eltoo transactions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be replaced by the honest party paying a higher-feerate (assuming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like nversion=3). I think there might still be an attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> triggerable under certain economic conditions, where the attacker overbids
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the higher-feerate transaction until the HTLC cltv expires. If this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attack is plausible, it could be even opportun if you're batching against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple channels, where the victims are not able to coordinate response.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; penalties: when you do a unilateral close, attempting to cheat comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with no cost to you and a possible benefit if you succeed, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; potentially does cost your channel partner (either in forcing them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to spend on-chain fees to update to the correct state, or in the risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of loss if their node malfunctions occassionally) -- a penalty could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reduce this incentive to cheat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think there has been a proposal in the past to enable penalties on top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of symmetric states by leveraging asymmetric witnesses [1]. Further, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonder if there is a game-theory interest for penalty-on-top-eltoo, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be an incentive against laziness, where a dysfunctional trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watchtower broadcasts an old state. On the qualification of the game-theory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soundness, I think one would have to run the empirical case study: select
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel counterparties randomly (no out-of-band assumptions), one set with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eltoo+penalty and the other with vanilla eltoo, observe the broadcast of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revoked states over some period.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; trustless watchtowers: we may want to consider the possibility of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; watchtower holding onto obsolete states and colluding with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attacker to attempt to cheat us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In terms of pinning and other mempool games, I think honest participant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own states leveraged by a colluding watchtower might increase the attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surface, especially post-anchor with the SIGHASH_SINGLE malleability on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second-stage HTLC transactions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (I think for initial eltoo experimentation it doesn't make sense to try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; deal with all (or perhaps any) of those constraints; simple and working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is better than complex and theoretical. But having them written down so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the ideas can be thought about and looked up later still seems useful)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I share the belief -- &quot;simple and working&quot; enable shorter iteration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cycles and hopefully fasten the protocol design learning curve. Beyond, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it's also realistic in face of the state of the LN ecosystem,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially on the watchtower issue. AFAICT, there is no even multi trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watchtower design covering the full execution of the protocol (i.e
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including HTLC-preimage/ HTLC-timeout claim), and such implementation is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> far from simple, as from now on you LN's chain backend might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asynchronicity issue to solve between your on-chain monitoring state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine (at least speaking in knowledge of the LDK-architecture).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * WA.n, WB.n : watchtower update to state n
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   - this is for an untrusted watchtower to correct attempted cheating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     by Bob on behalf of Alice (or vice-versa). Spends UB.k or WA.k
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     (or UA.k/WB.k) respectively, provided k &lt; n.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if the introduction of watchtower specific transactions doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break the 2*to_self_delay assumption (iiuc it's a design goal of current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol) and what is the design rationale. Beyond that, there is a concern
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with watchtower-specific transactions, it might leak your towers topology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (i.e the number of them and the distribution in the p2p network) to an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adversary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * SA.n, SB.n : slowly claim funds according to state n
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   - this is for Alice to claim her funds if Bob is completely offline
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     (or vice-versa). Spends UA.n, UB.n, WA.n or WB.n with relative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     timelock of to_self_delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I'm following correctly the description, this is logically equivalent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the sweep of a `to_local`/`to_remote` output on a commitment transaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though instead the waiting delay is eltoo shared_delay. There is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to_self_delay, at the punishment seems only to happen on the update-level,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or maybe one should be also able to punish slow fund exit, and another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relative locktime should exist on the S* transactions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * Alice and Bob's watchtower collude, but Bob has many watchtowers:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     F -&gt; UA.k1 -&gt; WB.k2 -&gt; WB.n -&gt; (to_self_delay) -&gt; SA.n -&gt; money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could the punishment transactions R* be also delegated to watchtowers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assuming they have been pre-signed to lockdown the exit scriptpubkeys ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In order to allow fast-forwards, when Alice proposes a new state,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; she needs to send her partial signatures to allow Bob to unilaterally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; accept the new state, ie sigs for: UB.n, CB.n, SB.n, RB.n. But she
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; also needs to be able to claim the funds if Bob proposes the new state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and broadcasts UB.n, she needs to be able broadcast CA.n. This can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; achieved with an adaptor signature approach (spelt out a bit more fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in the gist) or a CTV-like approach, provided that UB.n reveals the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; state needed to calculate the the CTV commitment (see &quot;EXPR_SETTLE&quot; in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/blob/29fe6d36cbad4101d5ec76c2b19c83c1494ac2fc/XX-eltoo-transactions.md">https://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/blob/29fe6d36cbad4101d5ec76c2b19c83c1494ac2fc/XX-eltoo-transactions.md</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you would like to have fast forward of chain of transactions, I wonder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if there could be also the &quot;sig-in-the-script&quot; trick, where UB.n
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scriptpubkey (or one of its tapscripts) contains the signature for CB.n,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SB.n, RB.n. Though you might have an issue of re-generating the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> witnessscript in case of state loss.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * how to add fees -- the U/W transactions are 1-in/1-out transactions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   that can't be trivially CPFPed by the proposer and need to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   fees added (either SINGLE/ANYONECANPAY signatures or having a 0-sat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   ephemeral output and package relay might be workable); the C/S/R
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   transactions are 1-in/many-out transactions, but have balance outputs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   that can be immediately spent to pay for fees via CPFP if package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   relay is available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Assuming something like nversion=3, the SINGLE/ANYONCANPAY could be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viable fee-bumping mechanism, as ancestor-based pinning should be less of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concern. Ephemeral anchor output could be a more efficient direction, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the output value can be cooperatively inflated from the channel value,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than relying on external fee-bumping reserves. I think even more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficient fee-bumping primitives can be introduced later.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * how to pay watchtowers -- when a watchtower broadcasts a W
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   transaction, it needs to add fees, and it's not clear (to me) how it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   could fairly and reliably ensure it's compensated for those costs,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   particularly if multiple W transactions are broadcast for a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   unilateral close attempt, due to one or more watchtowers colluding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   with an attacker, or simply having out of date information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if paying a watchtower, or getting paid as a watchtower isn't  a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;counterparty risk&quot; similar to what is happening with jamming due to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-covered HTLC forward risk. The watchtower has the risk of not being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paid a posteriori and the user has the risk of the tower not acting. There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is even a trade-off between tower costs and safety, as the more towers you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have, more robust if your Lightning channel (in theory, as you also have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duplication of the key material).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * lack of layered transactions -- while this prevents you having to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   wait longer than to_self_delay before you can claim channel funds,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   it still means that any htlc that is going to timeout sooner than that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   may not be claimable on-chain, meaning you need to set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   cltv_expiry_delta &gt;= to_self_delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From a security perspective, offsetting the cltv_expiry_delta to a value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> superior to to_self_delay can be considered as an improvement, especially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it gradually does it network-wide. On the other hand, if routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithms start to penalize long-cltv-delta payment paths as the timevalue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of liquidity is priced in routing fees, this design rationale might not be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aligned with long-term LN network incentives (as of today even more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loosely-defined than miner incentives).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * extending to multiparty channels -- penalising is hard if there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   more than two parties, fast forwards are probably impossible since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   you need multiple round-trips to coordinate signatures anyway, and if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   you're doing channels-within-channels to reduce your n-party channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   to an easier to update 2-party channel you're probably forced to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   to_self_delay for each layer of channels. Also, just figuring out how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   to coordinate multiparty state updates and even keeping everyone in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   a multiparty channel online consistently to generate new signatures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;   seems potentially hard?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know if penalising has been a solved issue for mulit-party, at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least in a trustless fashion in the same way we have with 2-party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LN-penalty (you could devise weird scheme based on timelock, taproot tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and threshold signatures incentivizing towards the convergence of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;consensus&quot; punishment, still...) Figuring out coordinating multi-party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> states updates sounds workable with modern consensus algorithms (e.g Raft),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though still conserving the fast forward effect is a high bar, it might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better deferred to an uplifted layer of 2-of-2 LN channels. The only reason
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you might have payments at the multi-party level (with the signature of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> N-of-N participants requested) only for privacy or liquidity allocation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason. Though effectively, it sounds like your multiparty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel coordination mechanism should encompass party eviction or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partitioning the offline parties. One or two orders of magnitude of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity beyond the 2-party eltoo channel case, I think.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The basic idea is &quot;if it's a two party channel with just Alice and Bob,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then if Alice starts a unilateral close, then she's already had her say,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so it's only Bob's opinion that matters from now on, and he should be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> able to act immediately&quot;, and once it's only Bob's opinion that matters,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you can simplify a bunch of things.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A &quot;gist&quot; for this idea is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/ajtowns/53e0f735f4d5c06a681429d937200aa5">https://gist.github.com/ajtowns/53e0f735f4d5c06a681429d937200aa5</A> (it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> goes into a little more detail in places, though doesn't cover trustless
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> watchtowers at all).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In particular, there are a few practical constraints that we might like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to consider for 2-party channels with eltoo:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  - fast forwards: we might want to allow our channel partner
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    to immediately rely on a new state we propose without needing a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    round-trip delay -- this potentially makes forwarding payments much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    faster (though with some risk of locking the funds up, if you do a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    fast forward to someone who's gone offline)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  - doubled delays: once we publish the latest state we can, we want to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    be able to claim the funds immediately after to_self_delay expires;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    however if our counterparty has signatures for a newer state than we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    do (which will happen if it was fast forwarded), they could post that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    state shortly before to_self_delay expires, potentially increasing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    the total delay to 2*to_self_delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  - penalties: when you do a unilateral close, attempting to cheat comes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    with no cost to you and a possible benefit if you succeed, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    potentially does cost your channel partner (either in forcing them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    to spend on-chain fees to update to the correct state, or in the risk
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    of loss if their node malfunctions occassionally) -- a penalty could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    reduce this incentive to cheat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  - trustless watchtowers: we may want to consider the possibility of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    watchtower holding onto obsolete states and colluding with an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    attacker to attempt to cheat us
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What follows is a rough approach for dealing with all those issues for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> two-party channels. It's spelled out in a little more detail in the gist.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I think for initial eltoo experimentation it doesn't make sense to try
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deal with all (or perhaps any) of those constraints; simple and working
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is better than complex and theoretical. But having them written down so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the ideas can be thought about and looked up later still seems useful)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In more detail: unilateral closes are handled by each channel participant
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> maintaining five transactions, which we'll call:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * UA.n, UB.n : unilaterally propose closing at state n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    - this is for Alice or Bob to spend the funding tx for a unilater
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      close to state n. Spends the funding transaction.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * WA.n, WB.n : watchtower update to state n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    - this is for an untrusted watchtower to correct attempted cheating
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      by Bob on behalf of Alice (or vice-versa). Spends UB.k or WA.k
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      (or UA.k/WB.k) respectively, provided k &lt; n.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * CA.n, CB.n : cooperatively claim funds according to state n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    - this is for Alice to confirm Bob's unilateral close (or vice-versa).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      Spends UB.k, WA.k (or UA.k/WB.k respectively), provided k &lt;= n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * SA.n, SB.n : slowly claim funds according to state n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    - this is for Alice to claim her funds if Bob is completely offline
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      (or vice-versa). Spends UA.n, UB.n, WA.n or WB.n with relative
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      timelock of to_self_delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * RA.n, RB.n : claim funds with penalty after unilateral close to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    revoked state
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    - this is for Alice to update the state if Bob attempted to cheat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      (or vice-versa). Spends UB.k or WA.k (or UA.k/WB.k respectively)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      conditional on k &lt; n - 1; outputs are adjusted to transfer a fixed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      penalty of penalty_msat from Bob's balance to Alice's (or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vice-versa)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Each of these &quot;transactions&quot; requires a pre-signed signature; however
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the actual transaction/txid will vary in cases where a transaction has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the possibility of spending different inputs (eg &quot;Spends UB.k or WA.k&quot;).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In particular UA.n/UB.n can be constructed with known txids and non-APO
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> signatures but WA.n/WB.n/CA.n/CB.n/SA.n/SB.n/RA.n/RB.n all require
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> APO signatures.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> They're named such that Alice can immediately broadcast all the *A.n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> transactions (provided a tx that it can spend has been broadcast) and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Bob can likewise immediately broadcast all the *B.n transactions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Scenarios where Alice decides to unilaterally close the channel might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> look like:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * if Alice/Bob can't communicate directly, but both are online:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      F -&gt; UA.n -&gt; CB.n -&gt; money
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    (balances and htlcs claimed, no delay)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * if Bob has gone offline entirely:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      F -&gt; UA.n -&gt; (to_self_delay) -&gt; SA.n -&gt; money
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * Alice cheats, Bob punishes:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      F -&gt; UA.k -&gt; RB.n -&gt; money[Alice pays Bob penalty]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * Bob is offline, Alice cheats, but Bob has a watchtower:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      F -&gt; UA.k -&gt; WB.n -&gt; (to_self_delay) -&gt; SA.n -&gt; money
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * Alice and Bob's watchtower collude, but Bob's not offline:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      F -&gt; UA.k1 -&gt; WB.k2 -&gt; RB.n -&gt; money[Alice pays Bob penalty]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * Alice and Bob's watchtower collude, but Bob has many watchtowers:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      F -&gt; UA.k1 -&gt; WB.k2 -&gt; WB.n -&gt; (to_self_delay) -&gt; SA.n -&gt; money
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For Alice to successfully cheat, she needs Bob to be offline for at least
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to_self_delay, and for all Bob's watchtowers to either also be offline,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or colluding.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This can be simplified somewhat, if you don't care about all the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> features:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * If you don't care about trustless watchtowers you can drop WA.n/WB.n
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    (and simplify SA.n/SB.n to not require an APO signature)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * If you don't care about penalties you can set penalty_msat to 0 and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    allow RA.n/RB.n to spend k&lt;=n. In this case, you can either drop
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    CA.n/CB.n entirely, or you can have CA.n/CB.n only be used for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> directly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    spending of UB.n/UA.n and thus not require APO signatures
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In order to allow fast-forwards, when Alice proposes a new state,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> she needs to send her partial signatures to allow Bob to unilaterally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> accept the new state, ie sigs for: UB.n, CB.n, SB.n, RB.n. But she
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> also needs to be able to claim the funds if Bob proposes the new state
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and broadcasts UB.n, she needs to be able broadcast CA.n. This can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> achieved with an adaptor signature approach (spelt out a bit more fully
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the gist) or a CTV-like approach, provided that UB.n reveals the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> state needed to calculate the the CTV commitment (see &quot;EXPR_SETTLE&quot; in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/blob/29fe6d36cbad4101d5ec76c2b19c83c1494ac2fc/XX-eltoo-transactions.md">https://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/blob/29fe6d36cbad4101d5ec76c2b19c83c1494ac2fc/XX-eltoo-transactions.md</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Note that in this scenario Alice doesn't provide WB.n to Bob
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> immediately. This is okay, as if Alice proposes UA.(n-1) (her most
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> recent state), Bob can still immediately claim via CA.n. If Bob did have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WB.n; then if Alice proposed UA.(n-1) Bob could wait for an initial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to_self_delay period and broadcast WB.n, forcing Alice to wait for an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> additional to_self_delay before being able to claim her funds via SA.n.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Note also that this is why RA.n/RB.n require &quot;k &lt; n - 1&quot; -- otherwise
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Alice would only be able to broadcast UA.(n-1) and Bob would immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be able to penalise by broadcasting RB.n.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Note that if you're using a watchtower and wish to punish your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> counterparty if it attempts to cheat, you should only pass WA.(n-2)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to your watchtowers, not WA.(n-1) or WA.n.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This doesn't address any potential issues from:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * how to add fees -- the U/W transactions are 1-in/1-out transactions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    that can't be trivially CPFPed by the proposer and need to have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    fees added (either SINGLE/ANYONECANPAY signatures or having a 0-sat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    ephemeral output and package relay might be workable); the C/S/R
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    transactions are 1-in/many-out transactions, but have balance outputs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    that can be immediately spent to pay for fees via CPFP if package
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    relay is available.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * how to pay watchtowers -- when a watchtower broadcasts a W
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    transaction, it needs to add fees, and it's not clear (to me) how it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    could fairly and reliably ensure it's compensated for those costs,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    particularly if multiple W transactions are broadcast for a single
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    unilateral close attempt, due to one or more watchtowers colluding
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    with an attacker, or simply having out of date information.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * lack of layered transactions -- while this prevents you having to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    wait longer than to_self_delay before you can claim channel funds,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    it still means that any htlc that is going to timeout sooner than that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    may not be claimable on-chain, meaning you need to set
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    cltv_expiry_delta &gt;= to_self_delay.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * extending to multiparty channels -- penalising is hard if there's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    more than two parties, fast forwards are probably impossible since
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    you need multiple round-trips to coordinate signatures anyway, and if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    you're doing channels-within-channels to reduce your n-party channel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    to an easier to update 2-party channel you're probably forced to have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    to_self_delay for each layer of channels. Also, just figuring out how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    to coordinate multiparty state updates and even keeping everyone in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    a multiparty channel online consistently to generate new signatures
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    seems potentially hard?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
