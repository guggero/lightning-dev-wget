Right, the trade-offs here are really tricky to navigate and to whatever extent this is possible the choice of what trade-offs to make should be pushed to the user. For example, not knowing the real time channel balances clearly hurts routing success. If this degraded routing success from 95 percent to say 90 percent the network as a whole would probably be willing to pay that routing success &quot;cost&quot; to ensure better balance privacy. But if it degraded routing success from 95 percent to say 50 percent I expect much of the network wouldn't be willing to put up with that terrible routing success percentage and routing nodes would probably seek to broadcast their channel balances either in gossip or out of band.

Similarly a routing node not knowing the source of the payment and the intermediate nodes on the route is fine (it is clearly *much* better for privacy) assuming jamming attacks occur rarely. But if the network is being paralyzed regularly by jamming attacks a routing node is going to show a lot more interest in which Lightning node it is routing payments for and which other Lightning nodes are also part of the route. You aren't going to want to continue to be subject to jamming attacks by the same Lightning node.

Hence I stick by this from a protocol developer perspective.

&quot;Decisions protocol developers make will impact what data can be collected and how easy that data is to collect (there are already some tricky trade-offs with regards to privacy, routing success and transparency for when things go wrong) but beyond that protocol developers should leave it to others.&quot;

A protocol developer (and individual implementation developer I guess) is going to have to wrestle with these trade-offs and to what extent options can be pushed to the user. But protocol reputation tokens that can be sold or transferred to an attacker or worse collected through gaming the system, ouch. The protocol developer has taken a problem (jamming attacks) that already exists and added an additional problem (reputation) which no doubt will be addressed by adding an additional problem on top of that and another on top of that etc etc.
