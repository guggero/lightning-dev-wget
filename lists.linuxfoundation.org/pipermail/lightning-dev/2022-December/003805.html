<PRE>Hi AJ,

I believe we're in sync on the attack description.

&gt;<i>  prior to (1): UA.k (k &lt;= n) -- However this allows Bob to immediately
</I>&gt;<i>  broadcast one of either CA.n or RA.n, and will then have ~150 blocks
</I>&gt;<i>  to claim the HTLC before its timeout
</I>
&gt;<i>From my understanding, with two party eltoo w/punihsment, UA.k has a
</I>tapscript path with &quot;1 CHECKSIGVERIFY k&lt;n CLTV&quot;, where the internal pubkey
substituted is &quot;musig(A,B)/1. Mallory should receive Bob's signature for
UA.k, though also UA.k+1, UA.k+2, UAk+3, until k=n.

Or is this a tapscript only existing for the dual-funding case ? I think
this a bit unclear from the gist construction, how Mallory is restrained to
use the tapscript path on UA.k, with UA.k+1 as she should be in possession
of Bob's signature for this state.

&gt;<i> I think traditional eltoo envisages being able to spend update transaction
</I>&gt;<i> 1 immediately, without having to wait for the next block.  This might
</I>&gt;<i> not be compatible with the version 3 relay rules that are being thought
</I>&gt;<i> about, though, and presumably would hit ancestor limits.
</I>
While update transaction 1 could spend update transaction 0 immediately,
there is no reliable knowledge by U*.1 transaction broadcaster of the state
of the network mempools. I believe the update transactions themselves could
be used to partition network mempools in multiple subsets (at least this is
achievable under LN-penalty with using old revoked states).

&gt;<i> I think a simple way to avoid that problem would be for eltoo nodes
</I>&gt;<i> to have a priority tx relay network -- if they see a channel close to
</I>&gt;<i> state N, always replace any txs closing to an earlier state K&lt;N, and
</I>&gt;<i> always quickly relay that close to all other peers. There's no reason
</I>&gt;<i> to assume the bad guys have the best access to the network when we can
</I>&gt;<i> write code so that the honest participants have it instead.
</I>
While I think this solution of eltoo nodes quickly replacing any state K
previous to the latest state N, there is no guarantee the latest state K
doesn't offer a higher feerate than state N, making it more attractive to
the miners.

One other solution could be a p2p extension allowing an update transaction
N to be &quot;blindly&quot; rebinded on any update transaction K, with K &lt; N, by
pointing to the channel funding output, and a per-counterparty ancestor
limit enforced as a policy rule (otherwise the malicious counterparty could
still buy all the ancestor limits).

A more sophisticated solution could be to &quot;trim&quot; the counterparty ability
to confirm multiple update transactions with some TLUV mechanism.

&gt;<i> In the two-party scheme, the only transaction Mallory can broadcast
</I>&gt;<i> after sending UA.k and having it confirmed on chain is SA.k, and that
</I>&gt;<i> only after a 144 block relative timelock. UA.(k+1) etc only spend the
</I>&gt;<i> funding output, but that has already been spent by UA.k.
</I>
See above question on the existence of a tapscript 1 path in update
transaction, and by which transaction type it could/should be spent. I
think the crux of the attack's soundness (or not) against two parties eltoo
w/ punishment relies here. AFAICT, if there is an unbounded spending path
cycle introduced for one of the counterparties, you're exposed to &quot;eltoo
states overflow&quot;.

Best,
Antoine

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The attack purpose is to delay the confirmation of the final settlement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction S, to double-spend a HTLC forwarded by a routing hop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The cltv_expiry_delta requested by Ned is equal to N=144.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe what you're suggesting here is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Mallory has two channels with Bob, M1 and M2. Both have a to_self_delay
</I>&gt;<i>   of 144 blocks. In that case cltv_expiry_delay should include some slack,
</I>&gt;<i>   I'm going to assume it's 154 blocks in total.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Mallory forwards a large payment, M1-&gt;Bob-&gt;M2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Mallory claims the funds on M2 just prior to the timeout, but
</I>&gt;<i>   goes offline on M1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Bob chose the timeout for M2 via cltv_expiry_delay, so now has 154
</I>&gt;<i>   blocks before the CLTV on the M1-&gt;Bob payment expires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this scenario, under the two-party eltoo scheme, Bob should:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1) immediately broadcast the most recent UB.n state for M1/Bob,
</I>&gt;<i>      aiming for this to be confirmed within 5 blocks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2) wait 144 blocks for the relative timelock to expire
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   3) broadcast SB.n to finalise the funds, and immediately claim the
</I>&gt;<i>      large HTLC. providing this confirms within 5 blocks, it will confirm
</I>&gt;<i>      before the HTLC timelock expires, and Mallory will have been unable
</I>&gt;<i>      to claim the funds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only transactions Mallory could broadcast are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   prior to (1): UA.k (k &lt;= n) -- However this allows Bob to immediately
</I>&gt;<i>   broadcast one of either CA.n or RA.n, and will then have ~150 blocks
</I>&gt;<i>   to claim the HTLC before its timeout
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   during (2): CA.n -- Again, this allows Bob to claim the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i>   immediately, prior to its timeout
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only delaying attack with repeated transactions comes if Bob
</I>&gt;<i> broadcasts an old state UB.k (k &lt; n), in which case Mallory can broadcast
</I>&gt;<i> (n-k) WA.i watchtower transactions prior to finalising the state. However
</I>&gt;<i> if Bob *only* has old state, Mallory can simply broadcast WA.n, at which
</I>&gt;<i> point Bob can do nothing, as (by assumption) he doesn't have access
</I>&gt;<i> to current state and thus doesn't have SB.n to broadcast it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The attack scenario works in the following way: Malicia updates the Eltoo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channel N time, getting the possession of N update transactions. At block
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A, she breaks the channel and confirms the update transaction 0 by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attaching a feerate equal to or superior to top mempool block space + 1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sat. At each new block, she iterates by confirming the next update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction, i.e update transaction 1 at block A+1, update transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction 2 at block A+2, update transaction 3 at block A+3, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think traditional eltoo envisages being able to spend update transaction
</I>&gt;<i> 1 immediately, without having to wait for the next block.  This might
</I>&gt;<i> not be compatible with the version 3 relay rules that are being thought
</I>&gt;<i> about, though, and presumably would hit ancestor limits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think a simple way to avoid that problem would be for eltoo nodes
</I>&gt;<i> to have a priority tx relay network -- if they see a channel close to

</I>&gt;<i> always quickly relay that close to all other peers. There's no reason
</I>&gt;<i> to assume the bad guys have the best access to the network when we can
</I>&gt;<i> write code so that the honest participants have it instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From Ned's viewpoint, there is limited rationality of the network
</I>&gt;<i> mempools,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as such each punishment transaction R, as it's confirmation could have
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delay due to &quot;honest&quot; slow propagation on the network is likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pre-signed with top mempool block space feerate, but not more to save on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fees. Therefore, transaction RN.0 should fail to punish update
</I>&gt;<i> transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0 as it's double-spent by update transaction 1, transaction RN.1 should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fail to punish update transaction 1 as it's double-spent by update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction 2, transaction RN.2 should fail to punish update transaction
</I>&gt;<i> 2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as it's double-spent by update transaction 3...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the two-party scheme, the only transaction Mallory can broadcast
