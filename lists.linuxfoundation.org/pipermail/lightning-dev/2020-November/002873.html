<PRE>Good morning Joost and Z,

So in your proposal, an htlc that is received by a routing node has the
&gt;<i> following properties:
</I>&gt;<i> * htlc amount
</I>&gt;<i> * forward up-front payment (anti-spam)
</I>&gt;<i> * backward up-front payment (anti-hold)
</I>&gt;<i> * grace period
</I>&gt;<i> The routing node forwards this to the next hop with
</I>&gt;<i> * lower htlc amount (to earn routing fees when the htlc settles)
</I>&gt;<i> * lower forward up-front payment (to make sure that an attacker at the
</I>&gt;<i> other end loses money when failing quickly)
</I>&gt;<i> * higher backward up-front payment (to make sure that an attacker at the
</I>&gt;<i> other end loses money when holding)
</I>&gt;<i> * shorter grace period (so that there is time to fail back and not lose
</I>&gt;<i> the backward up-front payment)
</I>

That's exactly it, this is a good summary.

An issue with the bidirectional upfront/hold fees is related to trustless
&gt;<i> offchain-to-onchain swaps, like Boltz and Lightning Loop.
</I>&gt;<i> As the claiming of the offchain side is dependent on claiming of the
</I>&gt;<i> onchain side of the trustless swap mechanism, which is *definitely* slow,
</I>&gt;<i> the swap service will in general be forced to pay up the hold fees.
</I>

Yes, that is a good observation.
But shouldn't the swap service take that into account in the fee it
collects to
perform the swap? That way it is in fact the user who pays for that fee.

Cheers,
Bastien

&gt;<i> Good morning Bastien, Joost, and all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An issue with the bidirectional upfront/hold fees is related to trustless
</I>&gt;<i> offchain-to-onchain swaps, like Boltz and Lightning Loop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the claiming of the offchain side is dependent on claiming of the
</I>&gt;<i> onchain side of the trustless swap mechanism, which is *definitely* slow,
</I>&gt;<i> the swap service will in general be forced to pay up the hold fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the hold-fees mechanism cannot be ported over in the
</I>&gt;<i> onchain side, so even if you set a &quot;reasonable&quot; grace period at the swap
</I>&gt;<i> service of say 1 hour (and assuming forwarding nodes are OK with that
</I>&gt;<i> humongous grace period!), the onchain side of the swap can delay the
</I>&gt;<i> release of onchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To mitigate against this, the swap service would need to issue a separate
</I>&gt;<i> invoice to pay for the hold fee for the &quot;real&quot; swap payment.
</I>&gt;<i> The Boltz protocol supports a separate mining-fee invoice (disabled on the
</I>&gt;<i> Boltz production servers) that is issued after the invoice is &quot;locked in&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> at the swap service, but I think that in view of the use of hold fee, a
</I>&gt;<i> combined mining-fee+hold-fee invoice would have to be issued at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time as the &quot;real&quot; swap invoice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
