This is a very common misconception among people. Lightning does not
reduce the fees that the miners may collect, it increases their reach
into transactions that they could not otherwise serve.

Think of it like this, there are nowadays many applications that are
completely unfeasible in Bitcoin due to the high transaction fees. The
transaction fees are high because an on-chain payment requires a lot
of resources, i.e., storage, processing and bandwidth. These
applications suddenly become possible with L2 protocols, so this adds
to the reach of Bitcoin itself.

On the other hand Lightning requires strong guarantees that the
transactions will be settled in a certain timeframe, for its
security. Hence, Lightning will always attach higher than average fees
to the on-chain transactions for setup and settlement of its
channels. This is okay since coins on these channels may have been
transferred hundreds if not millions of times back and forth, so the
these high on-chain fees have been amortized over time, and we happily
pay them.

With the (1) extension of Bitcoin's reach and (2) the higher than
usual fees for setup and settlement, I'm absolutely convinced that
miners will have a net gain when Lightning rolls out. Lightning is not
cutting into the miner's profit, it opens up new possibilities.

&gt;<i> Given this, IMHO the only way to move forward would be to start running

</I>
That may not all that easy since it'd require a major overhaul of some
parts of the current protocol and would add a lot of complexity that
segwit'd allow us to sidestep.

&gt;<i> If my assumption was correct, wouldn't it be possible to have an

</I>&gt;<i> And, instead of using revocation, use shorter locktimes like the
</I>&gt;<i> Spillman-style payment channels do (everytime there's a need to change

</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable to malleability; so my question is: is there a way to create
</I>&gt;<i> OP_CLTV/OP_CSV-style channels (instead of nLockTime-based, so malleability
</I>&gt;<i> resistant) without using revocation methods?
</I>
We actually have a protocol that does just that: my Duplex
Micropayment Channels, but it has been neglected a bit lately and
simply is not at the same development level as Lightning
is. Furthermore it assumes that we have a malleability fix, otherwise
the invalidation tree construction does not work.
