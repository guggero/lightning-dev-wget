The three levels from the Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong talk aren't really
tightly defined/analysed; it's not worth reading *too* much into them. The
third level in particular conflates segwit and the SIGHASH_NOINPUT idea;
the former fixes malleability, but the latter would fix malleability and
allow much better trustless outsourcing.

So:

 level 1 -- CLTV only, no CSV; channels have a fixed end date, and every
   commitment has a fixed must-spend/obsolete-by date as well. no longer
   relevant.

 level 2 -- CLTV and CSV, but second and third party malleability still
   possible. the current state of affairs. can only fund channels on one
   side or second party malleability messes you over, and may need to
   do something clever to avoid third party malleability (like introduce
   a time limit on the channel), but otherwise works great.

 level 3(a) -- CLTV, CSV and segwit -- malleability isn't relevant.
   outsourcing of channel monitoring is inelegant (effectively
   infeasible?), because you need to provide whoever does the monitor
   with signed penalty txns for every possible transaction

 level 3(b) -- CLTV, CSV and SIGHASH_NOINPUT (with or without segwit) --
   all the benefits of 3(a) and you can cheaply get someone else to monitor
   the blockchain for you, making a &quot;lite&quot; lightning node feasible

The lightning paper itself is mostly designed around &quot;level 0&quot; when
there wasn't even an OP_CLTV and you had to have intermediate layers of
transactions using nLockTime to enforce the delay. (No doubt there will
be &quot;level 4&quot; down the line when MAST/signature aggregation or something
that makes things even more amazing)

&gt;<i> But no, we're talking about using CLTV (or CSV, I guess?) for the refund
</I>&gt;<i> transaction instead of for the HTLC. Would we be able to call this an
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical Level2.5 of LN? (Level 3 being the one requiring SeqWit).
</I>
I think everyone's been focussed on 3(a) because getting rid of
malleability is obviously a great thing for everyone in bitcoin, and
segwit makes that actually possible. I'm not sure if there are actually
variations of level 2 to justify a 2(a)/2(b) or 2.5 or similar.

Cheers,
aj
