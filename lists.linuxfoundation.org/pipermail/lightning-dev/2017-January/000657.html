</I>&gt;<i> I thought the big problem was setup; you can't setup a new channel with a

</I>&gt;<i> was anywhere near ready, let alone already being blocked by miners :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have an idea on that though, I think... The idea when we were looking at
</I>&gt;<i> BIP 62 as a solution (which would have still left signature malleability
</I>&gt;<i> as a problem) was to have only one side pay into the funding transaction,
</I>&gt;<i> so that the other side couldn't malleate it and prevent the inital
</I>&gt;<i> refund. ie:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Alice pays $X into an output redeemable by 2-of-2 multisig, Alice and
</I>&gt;<i> Bob,
</I>&gt;<i>    signs it, works out the txid, but doesn't publish yet.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Alice asks Bob to sign a refund tx that spends that transaction giving
</I>&gt;<i> $X
</I>&gt;<i>    back to Alice, with the usual HTLC behaviour so that it becomes unusable
</I>&gt;<i>    once the channel starts being used.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Once Bob does this and Alice is satisfied, Alice publishes the original
</I>&gt;<i>    $X tx and once it is in the blockchain the channel is open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that if any third party malleability is possible, and
</I>&gt;<i> happens to Alice's original tx, then Bob's signature on the refund tx is
</I>&gt;<i> no longer useful, and unless Bob is kind enough to sign a new refund tx,
</I>&gt;<i> Alice has lost her money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given there's no cost to Bob doing this, and potentially some profit if
</I>&gt;<i> Bob can convince Alice to pay a 10% fee to get her money back (or even
</I>&gt;<i> just the joy of vandalism if you're a troll or hate the idea of lightning
</I>&gt;<i> or whatever), there could be lots of people filling the role of &quot;Bob&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and it could be hard to find someone safe to open a channel with, and,
</I>&gt;<i> in effect, lightning isn't usable at all except with people you already
</I>&gt;<i> know and trust, which isn't very decentralised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But I thought this problem was already solved by using OP_CLTV/OP_CSV
-style channels instead of Spillman-style ones?
