<PRE>Hi all,

        There are a couple of changes which are being proposed for
commitment transactions, and I wanted to bring the conversation outside
github to a wider audience:

1. To-remote output is currently P2PKH: should we make it P2WPKH and
   save some bytes?

2. Fabrice proposed we make commitment transaction outputs directly
   spendable by the penalty transaction; currently can only use the
   revocation key with the HTLC-success or HTLC-timeout transactions.
  
        <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/88">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/88</A>

I've included my reply to that PR here, for further discussion:

Fabrice Drouin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">notifications at github.com</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;<i> We would like to propose a small modification of the commiment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction HTLC scripts, which would make it possible, when the other
</I>&gt;<i> party publishes a revoked commit transaction, to create penalty
</I>&gt;<i> transactions that spend the HTLC outputs. With  the current design the
</I>&gt;<i> penalty transaction spends the second-stage HLTC-timeout and
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC-success transactions.
</I>
Interesting!  Tadge pointed out we could eliminate that, and we did
without actually measuring the complexity cost.

&gt;<i> This does not change the way external channel monitors would work, but for node which do their own monitoring this has several advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> - for htlcs offered by the counterparty: we don't need to know the counterparty's HTLC-timeout signature, which simplifies BOLT2 and saves the burden of storing the signatures
</I>
More importantly, it relieves us of having to generate and send those
signatures, which is a potential bottleneck.  Especially for Tadge's
Raspberry Pi!

&gt;<i> - for htlcs received we don't need to wait for the htlc timeout refund to claim the funds and we don't need to watch for HTLC-success transactions.
</I>
For offered htlcs we still need to handle both the HTLC-success and
commit tx cases though, since it can race with the other side.
Similarly with received htlcs and HTLC-timeout transactions.

So I think most of the complexity is still there, though the penalty
doesn't need to wait.

&gt;<i> ## Changes to the Offered HTLC Output script:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution we propose is to use a multisig 2-of-3 with `localkey`, `remotekey` and `revocationkey` for the Offered HTLC Output script:
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;remotekey&gt; OP_SWAP
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
</I>&gt;<i> OP_NOTIF
</I>&gt;<i>     # To me via HTLC-timeout transaction (timelocked) or to you with revocation key.
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_DROP 2 OP_SWAP &lt;localkey&gt; &lt;revocationkey&gt; 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
</I>&gt;<i> OP_ELSE
</I>&gt;<i>     # To you with preimage.
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_HASH160 &lt;ripemd-of-payment-hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_CHECKSIG
</I>&gt;<i> OP_ENDIF
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This output can be spent, as before, with the remote key and payment preimage, or with the remote key and local key, 
</I>&gt;<i> but it can be spent also be spent with the remote key and revocation key, with the following witness script: 
</I>
Clever abuse of multisig :) It can also be spent with the local and
revocation keys, but that should never happen.  OK.

&gt;<i> ## Changes to the Received HTLC Output script
</I>&gt;<i> We use  additonal IF branch  (there is probably a better way to do this?):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;remotekey&gt; OP_SWAP
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
</I>&gt;<i> OP_IF
</I>&gt;<i>     # To me via HTLC-success transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_HASH160 &lt;ripemd-of-payment-hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY
</I>&gt;<i>     2 OP_SWAP &lt;localkey&gt; 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
</I>&gt;<i> OP_ELSE
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_SIZE 0 OP_EQUAL
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_IF
</I>
Would OP_SIZE OP_NOTIF work here as an optimization?

&gt;<i>         # To you after timeout.
</I>&gt;<i>         OP_DROP &lt;locktime&gt; OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
</I>&gt;<i>         OP_CHECKSIG
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_ELSE
</I>&gt;<i>         # To you if you have the revocation key  
</I>&gt;<i>         OP_SWAP 2 OP_SWAP &lt;revocationkey&gt; 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
</I>&gt;<i>     OP_ENDIF
</I>&gt;<i> OP_ENDIF
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This output can be spent, as before, with the payment preimage and the remote and local keys, with the remote key after a delay,
</I>&gt;<i> but it can also be spent with the remote key and revocation key, with the following witness script:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ```
</I>&gt;<i> 0 &lt;remote-sig&gt; &lt;revocation-sig&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ``` 
</I>
I did a quick recalculate the weights of the commitment tx in Appendix
A.  offered_htlc_script goes from 104 bytes to 138 bytes,
accepted_htlc_script from 109 bytes to 152 bytes (assuming OP_SIZE
OP_NOTIF works).

HTLC-timeout weight goes from 634 to 668, HTLC-success from 671 to 714.
That's about 6%, which is pretty small.

Tadge was optimizing for the smallest possible on-chain footprint, which
I think is a valid concern.  But let's please discuss the tradeoffs...

Thanks!
Rusty.
