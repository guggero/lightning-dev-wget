<PRE>Hi,

The problem
===========

One major vulnerability of the Lightning network is that, if someone
wants to perform a DoS attack on the network, that possible for the
attacker by sending many large transactions to himself, over a long
route, and letting them time out (never reveal the payment pre-image).
Nobody (including the attacker) gains or loses any funds, but a lot of
funds get locked up, and the total cost of lost opportunity to innocent
nodes is a lot higher than that of the attacker.

In Milan, we came to a solution for this DoS mode, where nodes require
either a fast commit or roll-back within a short amount of time (say 30
seconds), or a proof that another channel was closed. This increases the
cost for the attacker with the cost of closing a channel (I'm not sure
if it actually decreases the cost for honest nodes: a channel close is
no proof that the pre-image won't be revealed, so the funds probably
have to stay locked up until the time-out anyway).

I disliked this approach right from the moment it was proposed: it
forces nodes to reveal, in certain situations, their channel state, to
remote nodes, in a format that has to be understandable to those remote
nodes. This basically limits the freedom in channel design to a design
space that can be understood by all nodes in the network. Any design
outside that space requires all other nodes to upgrade; such an upgrade
would be very hard to deploy. Instead of being an individual decision
between two peers, channel design now becomes a collective network
decision.

This interferes with my vision, presented in Montreal, of a
heterogeneous network. Some examples of things that will become
impossible, or very difficult to accomplish:
* Transparent routing between side chains: nodes that don't know about a
certain side chain can't verify a channel close on that side chain.
* Trust-free de-centralized exchange between different block chains:
different block chains, so same story.
* Trust-free de-centralized exchange of different assets on the same
block chain (e.g. colored coins): other nodes might reject this if they
don't understand the amount locked in the HTLC.
* Channel design upgrade: we're probably first going to deploy Rusty's
channel design; I suppose some variation of the Poon/Dryja design will
have benefits over Rusty's design, once Bitcoin is ready for it. I
expect there will probably be other channel design upgrades in the
future.

Proposed solution
=================

As an alternative to the protection mechanism discussed in Milan, I
explored the possibility to let the payer of the transaction pay (a part
of) the transaction fees at the start of the transaction (when locking
funds into HTLCs), such that, even in case of a roll-back, intermediate
nodes would receive transaction fees. This could accomplish two goals:
* compensate intermediate nodes for the damage inflicted on them by a
DoS attack
* put these costs onto the DoS attacker, thereby making the attack
unattractive.

Two variations are explored: one where the in-advance fee is constant,
and one where it depends on the time it takes for the transaction to
roll back. The consequences for the intermediate node incentives in all
steps of the transaction are evaluated.

Results
=======

<A HREF="https://cornwarecjp.github.io/amiko-pay/doc/lightning-incentives.ods">https://cornwarecjp.github.io/amiko-pay/doc/lightning-incentives.ods</A>

The spreadsheet is based on a rough estimate of what Lightning market
conditions can look like.

The initial conclusion was optimistic: it is indeed possible to add such
fees, up to a certain amount, without disturbing the incentives.
However:
* Given the assumptions in the spreadsheet, these fees can not be made
high enough to fully compensate the intermediate nodes.
* Since these fees are much smaller than the time value of the locked up
money for a single node, they do not significantly impact an attacker
who is already prepared to bear these costs for his own node.
* Since there is an upper limit to the size of the total fee, and the
total fee increases with the length of the route, this solution does not
scale well with the length of the route.
* Even if it would work (with different parameters), having a security
solution that depends so much on market conditions is probably a bad
idea, if we aren't really sure about these market conditions.


Conclusions / discussion
========================

Although I'd really like to see alternative ways to address this DoS
mode, I don't see how this solution could help. So, sorry, it's a
negative result.

The only alternative I see so far is that peer relationships become
somewhat trusted, so that peers (implicitly) trust each other not to
expose each other to large numbers of long-duration transactions. It's
not clear though how nodes can live up to that expectation, especially
when onion routing removes all information on the origin of
transactions.

To add a positive note: the way how the spreadsheet is set up might be
of interest to you. Maybe you'd like to do some exploration of
incentives for yourself in the future. The spreadsheet adds some insight
in the orders of magnitude we could expect for certain parameters
(although, ultimately, it will be up to the market to decide these). For
instance:
* I expect both the occupation rate of channels and the fee rate of
nodes to be pretty low, and still investing your funds in channels is
quite profitable. This is because transactions tend to be pretty fast,
so their fees add up pretty quickly when doing that over the course of a
year.
* The time value of money lost to transactions that block all the way to
their HTLC time-out is pretty huge compared to the tx fees. This is
because HTLC time-out is typically a very long time compared to typical
successful transaction durations: in order to avoid DoS-&gt;theft
escalation, intermediate nodes have to have a significant time-out
increment, so they can handle e.g. a local internet outage. This might
be different with Tadge's channel watching delegation though.

If you think I did anything wrong, or if you have any suggestions, let
me know.
