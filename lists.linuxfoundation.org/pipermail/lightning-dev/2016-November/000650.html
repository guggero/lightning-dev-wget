Unfortunately, the proposal is to route the information back, to prove
somebody was punished for the delay.

That *is* fairly incompatible with crossing networks, since the risk is
now borne by the node doing the crossing (and its neighbor).  Alice will
always have to close with Bob in your example.

Perhaps Bob will simply charge an exchange premium for this risk, but
I feel sorry for Alice; it seems to increase risk overall to the
network since the attacker does not have to close her own channels now.

Cheers,
Rusty.
