<PRE>I see, thank you for the explanation.

Now  I understand, so if my node is down and I received payments, I
may  lose some of my received payments.
But if I route and someone routed large amounts of money through me,
and then my node is down, then may lose these payments too.

Basically, if I am routing,  then if my node crashes, I may be liable
for some of the routed funds, in addition losing some of the  funds I
received .

So from the safety perspective there are three stages of risk

a) send only
b) send and receive
c) send and receive and route

&gt;<i> Good morning Stan,

</I>&gt;<i> Money is safe when network is down only if you only pay out of your node.
</I>&gt;<i> Once you receive, it is possible for your counterparty to transmit an
</I>&gt;<i> invalid old state where it owns more money than you do.  Then you need to
</I>&gt;<i> monitor the blockchain for invalid closings of channel state, meaning you
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be offline for more than a few days (this timeout is settable in your
</I>&gt;<i> node).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, consider the below situation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You make a channel to me and load it with 3mBTC.  You force the channel to
</I>&gt;<i> be unidirectional, because you might be offline for months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stan: 3mBTC, ZmnSCPxj: 0mBTC Initial state
</I>&gt;<i> Stan: 2mBTC, ZmnSCPxj: 1mBTC after you pay me 1 mBTC
</I>&gt;<i> Stan: 1mBTC, ZmnSCPxj: 2mBTC after you pay me 1 mBTC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now suppose you decide to accept money via this channel.  So the channel
</I>&gt;<i> history now becomes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stan: 2mBTC, ZmnSCPxj: 1mBTC after I pay you 1 mBTC
</I>&gt;<i> Stan: 3mBTC, ZmnSCPxj: 0mBTC after I pay you 1 mBTC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, I can take back my 2mBTC by replaying the old &quot;Stan: 1mBTC,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj: 2mBTC&quot; state.  Normally, this is a bad move on my part, since old
</I>&gt;<i> state is revoked and you can present evidence of fraud on the blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> layer to take the entire channel value as yours, as damages.  However, you
</I>&gt;<i> only have a few days where you can present this evidence.  If those few days
</I>&gt;<i> pass, then the payment is finalized and I get back the 2 mBTC I paid to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The upshot is that if you receive money for any reason (whether for routing,
</I>&gt;<i> or because you are the final payee) you can only be offline for at most a
</I>&gt;<i> few days.  Otherwise, you force yourself into unidirectional mode only (you
</I>&gt;<i> can only pay, never receive): unidirectional mode also is bad for you since
</I>&gt;<i> you cannot offset the fees you pay for spending using fees you receive for
</I>&gt;<i> routing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are going to receive money anyway, you might as well enable routing
</I>&gt;<i> also, because that lets you earn some fees (to offset the fees you would pay
</I>&gt;<i> to spend your money).  The added risk is low: most routes will either
</I>&gt;<i> successfully reach the destination, or fail outright, within a few seconds,
</I>&gt;<i> freeing the funds back to you again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The protocol has two settings &quot;max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;max_accepted_htlcs&quot; to limit your exposure to routing risk.  These limit
</I>&gt;<i> how much of your channel funds can be spent on routing
</I>&gt;<i> (max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat) and the number of routes at a time that
</I>&gt;<i> should be used on that channel (max_accepted_htlcs).  If those limits would
</I>&gt;<i> be violated by a route attempting to go to you, the route simply fails and
</I>&gt;<i> the payer will have to find another route.

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you - this is lots of information !)
</I>&gt;<i> You would also have to make your outgoing channels private (not sent by node
</I>&gt;<i> gossip) so that others will not route through you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I would have only a single outgoing channel I would not have to
</I>&gt;<i> make it private ? Correct? There is no way to route through a node
</I>&gt;<i> that has one channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another interesting question is what happens if I have lots of
</I>&gt;<i> channels, but in my software block all routing through my node?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way for me to block all routing through my node by
</I>&gt;<i> modifying node software but still enjoy all benefits of receiving and
</I>&gt;<i> sending deposits?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you said, blocking all routing has lots of benefit since money is
</I>&gt;<i> safe if the network is down :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for playing devils advocate - I am just trying to understand it )

</I>&gt;<i> You would also have to make your outgoing channels private (not sent by node

</I>&gt;<i> receive money on-Lightning (since your channels are private, people who are
</I>&gt;<i> trying to send money to you on-Lightning will not be able to find a route to
</I>&gt;<i> you). You will not earn any money from routing fees (since you are not
</I>&gt;<i> willing to have others use your channels for routing).
</I>&gt;<i> It has the advantage that you can actually lose Internet connectivity
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely with no possibility of loss of funds, simply because in this
</I>&gt;<i> mode of operation, channels are effectively unidirectional only from you to
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of the network.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think in the long run, you would prefer to receive funds by
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning also, and so cannot use this kind of operation. Consider that in
</I>&gt;<i> the future, you may get paid your salary or dividends in bitcoin over
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning: your business/employer receives money from its customer over
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning, it sends part of that money to sub-contractors and suppliers, and
</I>&gt;<i> some to you (employee or shareholder). You then spend the money you receive
</I>&gt;<i> as salary/dividends for food and services and other vices you might have,
</I>&gt;<i> which are provided by other businesses which have their own shareholders,
</I>&gt;<i> employees, sub-contractors, and suppliers.
</I>&gt;<i> In such a world, you would have to make your channels public and accept
</I>&gt;<i> incoming channels, and at minimum accept incoming money (even if you reject
</I>&gt;<i> routing attempts). Since routing can earn you some amount of money as fees,
</I>&gt;<i> you probably want to accept at least a few routing attempts at a time to
</I>&gt;<i> earn some fees (and offset the fees on your own transactions). This also
</I>&gt;<i> leads to a more mesh-like network; the &quot;unidirectional mode&quot; where you keep
</I>&gt;<i> all your channels private and only outgoing effectively makes you a
</I>&gt;<i> second-class member of the network (and has higher onchain fees: if you have
</I>&gt;<i> depleted a channel, there is an incentive to keep it open only if you are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to accept routing attempts through you (every open channel is an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to route, and a channel depleted on your end is full on the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite end and you can still at least accept transactions toward you),
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise, you are better off closing channels (and incurring fees) so you
</I>&gt;<i> can recover the channel reserve).
