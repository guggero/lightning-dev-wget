<PRE>I tried to find this information in the BOLT documents but I couldn't find
it. Is it possible to set up the channel so that the fee depends on the
direction, i.e. a different fee on the receive direction and different on
the send one? Why such functionality?

Imagine that you start with a bidirectional channel to Alice and a channel
to Bob with 1000 satoshi each. For some reasons, the network routes most of
the transactions from Alice to you and then to Bob and you end up with 1900
satoshi in the Alice channel and only 100 satoshi in the Bob one. The route
will stop working and if there is little traffic in the other direction you
will have to close the channels to rebalance them or wait a very long time
for the rebalancing.

If the fee could depend on the direction, one could start to ramp up fees
on the receiving end of the channel that is getting large and lower the one
that is empty to prevent the imbalance.

There is also a risk factor involved. The lightning network channels get
riskier on the receive side the more the channel value deviates from the
original state since the counterparty may try to broadcast the old state so
you may want to regulate this imbalance with fees. It would be best if the
LN applications could do it automatically.

Regards,

Edward
