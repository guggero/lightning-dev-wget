<PRE>Thank you


Presumably many nodes will be behind firewalls.  Are there any
firewall traversal mechanisms included (or some type of an overlay
network)?)

</I>&gt;<i> means to commit some bitcoins to a payment channel between you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>How do I find out if someone wants to connect to me?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>The node connects to yours and sends channel funding messages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In this case there is some kind of an UI where I can accept or reject -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Or I auto-accept everyone that connects to me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None.  You auto-accept incoming channel requests.  You might, if you are up
</I>&gt;<i> to it, program your node to reject some nodes via any heuristic you choose,
</I>&gt;<i> but you would have to implement that yourself.  I know of no current LN
</I>&gt;<i> software that has or intends to have such a feature, as there are little
</I>&gt;<i> downside to accepting all channels --- you only spend less than a kilobyte
</I>&gt;<i> of storage for each newly-opened channel --- while the upside is that a
</I>&gt;<i> channel to you is a potential route which you can charge for, or a route you
</I>&gt;<i> can receive funds through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>If you intend to connect for the purpose of becoming a hub and earning
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> routing fees, if you have some onchain bitcoins you can afford to invest,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then it is to your interest to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If I become a hub, how much to I earn, approximately in routing fees?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is it a percentage of transactions? Are routing fees the same for all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>hubs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each node indicates as part of its information a &quot;fixed fee&quot; and a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;proportional fee&quot;.  The &quot;fixed fee&quot; is imposed per successful routing
</I>&gt;<i> attempt, while the &quot;proportional fee&quot; is a ratio of the value traveling
</I>&gt;<i> through the node when it is on the route.  It is expected that there will be
</I>&gt;<i> many nodes through which  people can route, so there will be much
</I>&gt;<i> competition and eventually the system will settle to a state where most
</I>&gt;<i> nodes charge the same low fee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If I am connecting to the network and see many hubs - how can I select
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which hub to connect to? Is there any performance/reputation info
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>available for any hub?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are none.  Presumably your auto-channeling program will gather
</I>&gt;<i> statistics and other information to make some guesses on which nodes have
</I>&gt;<i> good performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that, there is nothing that specially privileges hubs, and this is
</I>&gt;<i> deliberate.  Any node can become a hub without permission or special
</I>&gt;<i> treatment of the network, if by &quot;hub&quot; we mean &quot;node with high number of
</I>&gt;<i> channels&quot;.  Indeed, even the DNS bootstrap, to my knowledge, should only be
</I>&gt;<i> used to gather initial node gossip to acquire some *other* nodes that can
</I>&gt;<i> potentially be channeled to.
