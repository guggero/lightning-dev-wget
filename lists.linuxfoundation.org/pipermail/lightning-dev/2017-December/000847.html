<PRE>Hi Cristian,

If there is such a great company, BlockStream. and Blockstream runs a
fantastic high quality node, then as a user why should I connect to
any node other than Blockstream?
In this case I dont need to be online all the time and dont need to
monitor the blockchain for anything. I will just believe that
Blockstream will do no bad to me.

Why do I need to drink unnamed cola if there is Pepsi?))  People used
to run emails servers, it is all Gmail now, much more secure and
reliable!

</I>&gt;<i> If you do not announce the existence of the channel to the wider network

</I>&gt;<i> request by adding the `r` parameter to the request. You are selectively
</I>&gt;<i> informing the sender about the channel, which can then use that
</I>&gt;<i> information to construct the route (and onion packet) and initiate the
</I>&gt;<i> payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even though you have only one channel, and announce it, people might
</I>&gt;<i> still want to route through you, by using the channel twice: once to
</I>&gt;<i> route to you and then back out from you. While this may seem wasteful,
</I>&gt;<i> it may be useful to hide the real origin/destination of the
</I>&gt;<i> payment. Another scenario for which this is useful is that you are an
</I>&gt;<i> auditor that witnesses the payment while it is being processed, for book
</I>&gt;<i> keeping or similar cases. This would also work for unannounced channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the decision whether to announce a channel is exactly what you're
</I>&gt;<i> looking for. It allows you to do bidirectional payments, and does not
</I>&gt;<i> allow random people to route through you. Implementations might
</I>&gt;<i> eventually add an &quot;endpoint mode&quot; that rejects any HTLC for which the
</I>&gt;<i> node is not the origin or the destination, which would further enforce
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
