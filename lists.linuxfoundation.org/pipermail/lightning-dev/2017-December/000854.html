<PRE>What's the rational for using millisatoshis as the units for lightning 
channels? Aren't you going to loose up to 1/2 of a satoshi when the 
channel is closed? Is this because it doesn't hurt and you might as well 
be open to the opportunity for these sub satoshi transactions, because 
if you aren't, you are giving up the opportunity to get accumulated 
revenue from many of those small transactions, that could end up being 
greater than 1/2 of a satoshi?

Since millisatoshis is used, is there a maximum channel funding size?

Is the optional initial push of millisatoshis during the channel 
creation there in order to motivate the other party to be willing to 
waste their time with the channel creation in the first place? If not, 
what's it for?

In all of the clients that I've looked at, I can't seem to find out how 
to define the timeout closing out a channel when someone does not 
cooperate. Is there a fixed value for this as part of the protocol? Or 
do most clients have a default that they enforce over all channels that 
they create?

Thanks,
