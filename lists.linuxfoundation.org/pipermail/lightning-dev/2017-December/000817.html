<PRE>Hi,

would LN allow the creation of marketplace(s) (ie. echanges)
where users can offer to overtake quasi-instantly the
payment obligation of someone else, for a little income
from the transaction fees?

Ie. then the regular network (bitcoin etc.) would optionally
first look whether there is an intermediary available in the &quot;orderbook&quot;
of the exchange that is willing to instantly overtake the payer's
obligation, and if yes then this transaction would be dealt by LN...

By this, the helping users (intermediary settlers, credit-givers)
would have a little income stream by helping with their own funds,
and w/o risking their funds.

I think many users would like such an idea for a small income,
and many such exchanges would open. They would announce their
service on the underlying network(s).

If such an exhange goes down then it shall have
no negative consequences for the participants.

Can such an infrastructure be built on top of LN?

Thx

</PRE>
