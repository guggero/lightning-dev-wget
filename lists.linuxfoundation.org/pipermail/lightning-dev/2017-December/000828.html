<PRE>Rusty,

&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you're referring to?  I've written two decoders, and
</I>&gt;<i> both pull off the header and fixed fields, then iterate
</I>&gt;<i> while (data_len &gt; 520 / 5).
</I>

What happens if the signature is missing or the signature is improperly
formatted?
It is much easier to detect a case like that at the beginning if we have:
  1. read 7 words for timestamp
  2. read 3 words for tags_total_length
  3. read tags_total_length words for the tags data
  4. read 104 words for signature and recoveryID
Then immediately you can tell &quot;oh, the signature is an invalid length&quot;
rather than
having to decide whether &quot;is the signature malformed or is the last tag
malformed?
if I run out of words while parsing a tag, is it because I just happened
upon a rare
case where I am parsing the signature as tags and the word just happened to
be a valid tag?&quot;

I just think it should be explicit to help prevent problems


&gt;<i> I disagree.  Obviously we can't force people to be descriptive (that's a
</I>&gt;<i> SHOULD), but not including a description of the purpose of the payment
</I>&gt;<i> is a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The invoice and the preimage provides a cryptographic proof of
</I>&gt;<i> purchase.  But that's undermined if the description is missing.
</I>

I disagree, but this is not a huge issue so I withdraw my comment.


&gt;<i> From the ML welcome: &quot;Be excellent to each other please!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand this mistake upset you, but &quot;Sorry, but this is nonsense&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> makes me want to find spurious justifications for it.  I prefer &quot;This
</I>&gt;<i> seems unfairly limiting&quot;, &quot;This is a mistake&quot; or &quot;Woah, time to go 8
</I>&gt;<i> bits, granddad!&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is the spec describes the 'd' field like so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         short description of purpose of payment (ASCII),  e.g. '1 cup of
</I>coffee'
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's nothing in the *requirements* section, at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I think we should:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  s/ASCII/UTF-8/
</I>&gt;<i>     - It seems everyone handles this fine anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Add another example, here, which is in UTF-8, say &quot;or '&#12490;&#12531;&#12475;&#12531;&#12473;&#12398;&#12459;&#12483;&#12503;'&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Add a requirement that the writer MUST use valid UTF-8.
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  Modify one of the examples to use a UTF-8 description.
</I>

Sorry I didn't mean to be offensive. I think I have been in Japan for too
long,
my English senses are dulling.

I agree with 1-4. &quot;&#12490;&#12531;&#12475;&#12531;&#12473; 1&#26479;&quot; is now a lightning meme. I am honored. ;)



&gt;<i> There is; no field can be greater than 640 bytes (1023 5-bit values).
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the transport might have practical limits, so you might need to
</I>&gt;<i> consider that in total.  (Maybe not though, if you're going for QR
</I>&gt;<i> codes, as they go pretty large).
</I>

640 bytes is rather long... but this is not really a huge issue for me.
So I withdraw my comment.


&gt;<i> Yes there should, but we left it open for the moment because there's no
</I>&gt;<i> good solution here, and someone needs to come up with one.  This makes
</I>&gt;<i> description hash fairly useless for now, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A URL is the obvious solution, but has the terrible property that it
</I>&gt;<i> de-anonymizes the wallet :( (even before the person has decided whether
</I>&gt;<i> they want to pay).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, there are a range of possible solutions, depending on the scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If you have some container format, eg. HTML, include the description
</I>as a
&gt;<i>    separate tag.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Roasbeef wants to implement HORNET over our network, and that could
</I>&gt;<i>    be used to retrieve the full description.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, 640 bytes should be enough for anyone!
</I>

HORNET sounds nice. Under this description, it seems like the plain
description
will be the primary method of communication for the forseeable future.


&gt;<i> Actually I think bech32 loses all guarantees at 1023 words, but it's no
</I>&gt;<i> worse than a 30-bit checksum.  We mainly use it because it's simple and
</I>&gt;<i> available, and of course any fixed-length code will have some limit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What actually happens if we decode badly is that we derive the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> public key for the node (50% chance, other 50% we get a signature
</I>&gt;<i> failure) and we can't route to it or pay to it.  So no funds are
</I>&gt;<i> actually lost.
</I>

Unless the incorrect pubkey just happened to be someone elses!!! (/s)
Yeah I guess if we don't care about error correction, a 30 bit checksum is
still pretty good.


&gt;<i> Yes, this was *awesome*; I double-checked the values by hacking my
</I>&gt;<i> python encoder, and adjusted for the recent r-encoding change.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> merged, thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/312">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/312</A>
</I>

Glad I could be of help. :)


&gt;<i> That would be fantastic!  We've talked about changing the test vectors
</I>&gt;<i> (for all the BOLTs) into a more machine-friendly JSON encoding, so if
</I>&gt;<i> you're feeling ambitious you could start with BOLT 11 :)
</I>

I'll have to work on that later this week. Currently trying to iron out our
Lightning
deposit / withdrawal UI with our front end engineer.


&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>
You're welcome!

Additional comment: we should make a requirement to hide text in the
description under certain conditions.

ie. &quot;A reader MUST hide information surrounded by curly brackets {}
including
the brackets themselves from the UI, and only make the information avaiable
internally.&quot;

I think a lot of people will want to include extra data in their payment
requests' description.

I think HTLC.ME uses it and maybe bitrefill? (correct me if I'm wrong.)

Perhaps adding an &quot;extra data&quot; tag?

... hmmm...


Thanks,
Jon
