</I>&gt;<i> that everyone has made. I think the bottom line is that a limit
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't hurt right now unless the purchasing power of bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically declines. This limit is like the block size limit in
</I>&gt;<i> that it is conservative and we need to have some experience in order
</I>&gt;<i> to determine whether the limit is needed at all. It proved to be
</I>&gt;<i> very clear over time that a block size limit was needed as one force
</I>&gt;<i> against centralization. Maybe a limit is needed for lightning
</I>&gt;<i> channels, maybe it isn't, but we need to first see how the network
</I>&gt;<i> starts to evolve. My main concern long term is that a large business
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't operate using lightning, because the channel sizes and
</I>&gt;<i> payment sizes are too small. What if you're buying an oil rig, a
</I>&gt;<i> locomotive, a gas turbine, a load of coal, or a herd of cattle.
</I>&gt;<i> Should a blockchain transaction be used for everyone in the world
</I>&gt;<i> for these types of purchases? But then again, maybe different types
</I>&gt;<i> of users will use different kinds of lightning networks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another reason against accepting large incoming channels yourself
</I>&gt;<i> would be that you may not want to encourage people paying you to
</I>&gt;<i> route through one of the super nodes. Super nodes are likely spies
</I>&gt;<i> or targets of spies and users won't naturally want to deal with
</I>&gt;<i> those types of actors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the Eclair implementation supports push_msat too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other than as &quot;training wheels&quot;, I'm still not sure why we need a
</I>&gt;<i> payment limit if we have a channel limit. It seems as though the
</I>&gt;<i> channel limit puts an implicit payment limit in place.
</I>
centralized payments have limits. Is that model flawed or does it
create a situation of check and balances to control situations where
transactions go sideways in ways unforseen?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    Perhaps some day, in the LONG TERM, the limits may be increased
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I was always under the impression that the channel and payment limits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;were intended to be training wheels, this is the first I've heard of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;them intended to stick around long term. I find the channel limit to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;be particularly restrictive, as it hinders some use cases I'd envision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;where large payment channels between two parties are useful and can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;also be used for routing LN payments. Large payments afaik can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;broken up into smaller ones without incurring too much cost or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;trouble,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Splitting up large payments would require multiple invoices at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;least for now (whether this is troublesome or not may be a matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of opinion, bit I suspect juggling more than a few invoices would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be painful as a user experience). Routing larger payments over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;multiple routes automatically while using a single invoice, is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;harder as multiple routes need to be set up, and each route must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have different preimages: further it is likely you want the entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;large payment to be done atomically, which would be harder to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;arrange.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;but that's not the case for creating channels. As the channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;itself involves only two parties - and in sticking to my general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;political/philosophical mantra - there is really no justification for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;limits to be imposed on this. Which brings me to my next point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Perhaps our definition of &quot;long term&quot; is askew. A year after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;mainnet release, I doubt anyone would feel safe implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;removal of the limit; this is my &quot;long term&quot;.  Five years, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;imagine quite a few will use the nonlimited version and may form a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;subnetwork among themselves.  But possibly by then it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unlikely that most people using Bitcoin at all would evem be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;capable of putting 150 mBTC in spending money on a hot wallet, in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;which case whether there is a 167 mBTC limit per channel or not is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;largely a moot point. Or perhaps I simply imagine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;hyperbitcoinization by then, with people putting entire bitcoins
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;into hot wallets equivalent to people putting thousands of USD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;today in their back pockets as invitation to be attacked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    There is also again the wisdom, that one should keep most of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    funds in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    cold storage, and only a small amount for spending in hot wallets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    Lightning nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I think this is a top-down way of thinking that runs counter to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;spirit of bitcoin. The &quot;wisest&quot; thing to do in fact may be to simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;buy inflation-adjusted treasury bonds and not mess with bitcoin at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;all, much less the experimental lightning network. As advice this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;perfectly fine to share with others for them to follow on a voluntary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;basis, but I don't see why this ought to be enforced as a rule on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;protocol level.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Possibly.  At the protocol level, a limit encourages the growth of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the network towards a mesh network rather than more central forms,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;however.  I merely put this since it is unlikely that most people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;following this &quot;wisdom&quot; would have an incentive to even run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;software with the limit removed: that is, by the time Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;becomes fully deployed the limit may not even be reached in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;practice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Also, I personally can't see a reason why a node would reject a large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;channel being made with it, where is the downside or risk? The party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;committing funds to the channel is the one risking loss or delay of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;funds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;But the party committing funds to the channel is known via node
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;gossip, and it is known also who the other end of the channel is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If you were to propose opening for example a 5BTC channel to me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;with the funds coming from you, I would consider the possibility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that I might get attacked in order to get to your funds (and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;might not have the resources to protect against such an attack on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;my end, even if you might). Further, putting 5BTC implies that at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;some point there is the future possibility, due to routing and so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on, that the channel will have around 5BTC belonging to me, and at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;some point before you can spend the entire 5BTC I would want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;close the channel and commit the funds that I now own into cold
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;storage (so that the ability to channel 5BTC from you to me is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;moot point).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
