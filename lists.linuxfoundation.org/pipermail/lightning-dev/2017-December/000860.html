<PRE>New to LN, so forgive me if this is already implemented/planned to be.

I&#8217;ve been trying out LN on testnet, treating it as if it was mainnet, as in how I would open channels, to whom and what amount.

One main problem is that a channel gets exhausted. I could have created a larger channel in the first place but channels are meant to last for days, even months, no? So its hard to predict that amount beforehand.

A = me
B = say yalls.org
C = some common channel
A exhausts his channel with B - all balance are with B.
A could open another channel with B but this would be costly.
A could pay B through C now, but as most transactions are micro(few cents) and A pays B for hundreds of articles per month, the base fee would pile up (as LN fees = base fee + proportional fee).
Balance before : <A HREF="https://imgur.com/a/L2JFA">https://imgur.com/a/L2JFA</A>

A - B (0,5)
A - C (10, 8)
C - B (10,10)
A pays self : He sends 5mBTC to C, who sends it to B, who sends it back to A.
Balance now : <A HREF="https://imgur.com/a/moNXY">https://imgur.com/a/moNXY</A> A - C(5,13)
C - B(5,15)
A - B(5,0)
So, A does a one time refill of A-B channel with the help of C. The proportional fee would be same if A sent through C every time or did a one time refill, but A in this case pays base fee only once to C.
I expect base fee to be around 1-2 cents by B, so this plot says the &#8220;refill method&#8221; could save a couple of dollars.
Fees saved, for various base fees and subsequent articles read- <A HREF="https://imgur.com/a/FAu31">https://imgur.com/a/FAu31</A> (gotta use the free campus matlab license for something).
Is doing this the same as using the -r tag in payment invoice? (Bolt #11) In UI terms, a &#8220;refill&#8221; button could be near a channel name. Luke Hanson
