<PRE>Good morning Stan,

The protocol allows nodes to be behind Tor hidden services (.onion domain names).  Tor hidden services automatically have NAT punching and firewall traversal, as long as the firewall allows Tor protocol to go through.

I do not know if there are already LN software that actually supports being run as a Tor hidden service yet, however.

Thank you

Presumably many nodes will be behind firewalls. Are there any
firewall traversal mechanisms included (or some type of an overlay
network)?)

Good morning Stan,
How to I discover nodes - is there any UI to see nodes currently
running on the network ?
There are no UIs to my knowledge. Current LN programs keep track of this in
their databases, although each one varies in detail. Presumably their
individual main developers know how to extract this information.
My understanding is that network bootstrap involves some LN nodes being
discoverable via DNS, then your node will connect to them, request node
gossip, then it (if you use some kind of auto-pilot channeling system like
what lnd has) will select from the node information it acquires to select
some nodes to connect and channel to.
Note a precision, there is a difference between &quot;connect&quot; and &quot;channel&quot;. To
connect, means only that you contact them over the network and consumes only
bandwidth and some small amount of CPU power on your node. To channel,
means to commit some bitcoins to a payment channel between you.
How do I find out if someone wants to connect to me?
The node connects to yours and sends channel funding messages.
In this case there is some kind of an UI where I can accept or reject -
correct?
Or I auto-accept everyone that connects to me?
None. You auto-accept incoming channel requests. You might, if you are up
to it, program your node to reject some nodes via any heuristic you choose,
but you would have to implement that yourself. I know of no current LN
software that has or intends to have such a feature, as there are little
downside to accepting all channels --- you only spend less than a kilobyte
of storage for each newly-opened channel --- while the upside is that a
channel to you is a potential route which you can charge for, or a route you
can receive funds through.
If you intend to connect for the purpose of becoming a hub and earning
routing fees, if you have some onchain bitcoins you can afford to invest,
then it is to your interest to
channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes.
If I become a hub, how much to I earn, approximately in routing fees?
Is it a percentage of transactions? Are routing fees the same for all
hubs?
Each node indicates as part of its information a &quot;fixed fee&quot; and a
&quot;proportional fee&quot;. The &quot;fixed fee&quot; is imposed per successful routing
attempt, while the &quot;proportional fee&quot; is a ratio of the value traveling
through the node when it is on the route. It is expected that there will be
many nodes through which people can route, so there will be much
competition and eventually the system will settle to a state where most
nodes charge the same low fee.
If I am connecting to the network and see many hubs - how can I select
which hub to connect to? Is there any performance/reputation info
available for any hub?
There are none. Presumably your auto-channeling program will gather
statistics and other information to make some guesses on which nodes have
good performance.
Note that, there is nothing that specially privileges hubs, and this is
deliberate. Any node can become a hub without permission or special
treatment of the network, if by &quot;hub&quot; we mean &quot;node with high number of
channels&quot;. Indeed, even the DNS bootstrap, to my knowledge, should only be
used to gather initial node gossip to acquire some other nodes that can
potentially be channeled to.
