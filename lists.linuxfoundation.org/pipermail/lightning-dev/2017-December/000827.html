But forwarding nodes do both, so they can charge appropriate fees.

&gt;<i> Another trivial question: can the fee be negative? It might help with some

</I>
In my original implementation, they could be.  However, that turns out
to be a very strange idea, and complicates routing.

&gt;<i> I tried to get the information from BOLT #3 but BOLT's are very hard to
</I>&gt;<i> read if you are not an expert. Who pays for the closing of the channel? Is
</I>&gt;<i> it the person who initiates the closing? Since opening and closing fees are
</I>&gt;<i> probably going to be larger than lifetime channel fees, it is much more
</I>&gt;<i> important than the LN fees. I worry about a scenario that I create a
</I>&gt;<i> channel (paying fees), send some funds through the channel to have the
</I>&gt;<i> channel available also for receiving and the other side of the channel,
</I>&gt;<i> simply cashes out the balance, and I'm without the channel  opening fees
</I>&gt;<i> and with no receiving channel.
</I>
The channel initiator pays all onchain fees, at the moment.  This is
simple, but potentially gamable.  However, current alternatives are
complex and potentially gamable, so we went with simple.

Cheers,
Rusty.
