<PRE>This operation is called splice in/out, or clopen transaction. There's some

&gt;<i> Hello, all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a long-time computer networking developer, but a newbie to
</I>&gt;<i> cryptocurrency, and am interested in contributing to its development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While looking at the lightning network design and code, I've come up with
</I>&gt;<i> an idea the would reduce the number of blockchain transactions used by the
</I>&gt;<i> LN, and the fees paid to confirm them, in a common LN use case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did a quick search and couldn't find this idea presented previously, but
</I>&gt;<i> I may have missed it. If so, or if the idea is faulty, I'm sure you guys
</I>&gt;<i> will let me know. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And forgive me if I don't have the terminology quite right yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The use case I am referring to is the frequent, repeated purchases by a
</I>&gt;<i> customer from the same merchant over an extended period of time. I think
</I>&gt;<i> this will be a common use case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example: Alice buys a cup of coffee from Bob's Coffee Shoppe every
</I>&gt;<i> day, has done so for years, will do so for years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To use the LN to pay for these purchases, Alice opens and funds an LN
</I>&gt;<i> channel to Bob. This takes one blockchain transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As coffees are purchased every day, funds are transferred from Alice to
</I>&gt;<i> Bob in the channel without any blockchain transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice cannot afford to fund the channel for an extended period of time,
</I>&gt;<i> and Bob is unwilling to wait an extended period of time to be paid for the
</I>&gt;<i> coffees Alice has purchased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So every week or so, Alice and Bob close the channel, Alice gets back any
</I>&gt;<i> unspent funds, and Bob gets the funds that have been transferred to him for
</I>&gt;<i> Alice's purchases. Then Alice and Bob re-open the channel with new funding
</I>&gt;<i> from Alice. Closing and re-opening the channel each take one blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the life of the channel, if there are n close/re-open cycles, 2*n
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain transactions are required: 1 to open the channel initially, 2
</I>&gt;<i> each time the channel is closed and re-opened (n-1 times), and 1 to close
</I>&gt;<i> the channel finally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the LN were enhanced with an operation to deposit and withdraw funding
</I>&gt;<i> in the channel to and from the blockchain without closing the channel, this
</I>&gt;<i> could be done with a single blockchain transaction that is essentially the
</I>&gt;<i> merge of the closing and re-opening blockchain transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this example, each adjustment will only pay Bob his accumulated but as
</I>&gt;<i> yet unpaid funds and charge Alice for the new funds she places into the
</I>&gt;<i> channel, but leave Alice's unspent funds in the channel. The channel could
</I>&gt;<i> continue to operate between the launching and confirmation of the
</I>&gt;<i> adjustment transaction if Alice has unspent funds in the channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the n cycles would only require n+1 blockchain transactions: 1 to
</I>&gt;<i> initially open the channel, 1 each time the channel funding is adjusted
</I>&gt;<i> (total n-1), and 1 to finally close the channel. This is a significant
</I>&gt;<i> reduction in the number of blockchain transactions required, approaching
</I>&gt;<i> 50% in the limit as n approaches infinity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about blockchain transaction fees? I've done the analysis, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> quite long (several conditions and dozens of combinations of conditions to
</I>&gt;<i> consider), so I won't include it here now. I will included it in another
</I>&gt;<i> post if anyone is interested and doesn't do the analysis for themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bottom line of the analysis is that the number of inputs and the
</I>&gt;<i> number of outputs in the funding adjustment transaction are each never
</I>&gt;<i> greater than the sum of the number of inputs and the number of outputs,
</I>&gt;<i> respectively, in the channel opening and closing transactions that the
</I>&gt;<i> adjustment transaction replaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus the adjustment transaction is:
</I>&gt;<i> - never bigger than the closing and re-opening transactions put together,
</I>&gt;<i> - sometimes smaller, and
</I>&gt;<i> - occasionally significantly smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And there's only one transaction instead of two, so ya always save on the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction header! :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, the fee paid for the adjustment transaction, assuming the same fee
</I>&gt;<i> rate for all the transactions, is:
</I>&gt;<i> - never more than the sum of the fees paid for the closing and re-opening
</I>&gt;<i> transactions,
</I>&gt;<i> - sometimes less, and
</I>&gt;<i> - occasionally significantly less.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This reduction in fees is by an additive amount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the channel remains open while waiting for the adjustment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction to confirm, there may be less urgency in having it confirm. So
</I>&gt;<i> it's fee rate can be reduced, reducing the fee paid by a multiplicative
</I>&gt;<i> amount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Combined, these two effects lead to a reduction in total fees paid for
</I>&gt;<i> operating the channel, sometimes a significant reduction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments expected and welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this high-level, bare-bones idea to seen to be worthy of further
</I>&gt;<i> consideration, I would like to work with the community to flesh out a
</I>&gt;<i> detailed specification, and, if consensus can be reached on that, to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the implementation of it.
