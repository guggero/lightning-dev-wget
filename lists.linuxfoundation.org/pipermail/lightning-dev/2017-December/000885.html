<PRE>Hello Christian,

I understand that you have to be in agreement with your direct peers. So 
you don't really care about what agreements others in your route may 
have in place? I would think that you would choose not to route through 
hops that violate your capacity limit.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all of the discussion on this topic. In general, I don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a solid opinion formed yet, but I understand all of the points that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone has made. I think the bottom line is that a limit doesn't hurt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right now unless the purchasing power of bitcoin dramatically declines.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This limit is like the block size limit in that it is conservative and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need to have some experience in order to determine whether the limit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is needed at all. It proved to be very clear over time that a block size
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limit was needed as one force against centralization. Maybe a limit is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed for lightning channels, maybe it isn't, but we need to first see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how the network starts to evolve. My main concern long term is that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large business couldn't operate using lightning, because the channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sizes and payment sizes are too small. What if you're buying an oil rig,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a locomotive, a gas turbine, a load of coal, or a herd of cattle. Should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a blockchain transaction be used for everyone in the world for these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> types of purchases? But then again, maybe different types of users will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use different kinds of lightning networks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another reason against accepting large incoming channels yourself would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be that you may not want to encourage people paying you to route through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the super nodes. Super nodes are likely spies or targets of spies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and users won't naturally want to deal with those types of actors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, the Eclair implementation supports push_msat too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other than as &quot;training wheels&quot;, I'm still not sure why we need a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payment limit if we have a channel limit. It seems as though the channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limit puts an implicit payment limit in place.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      Perhaps some day, in the LONG TERM, the limits may be increased
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was always under the impression that the channel and payment limits
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were intended to be training wheels, this is the first I've heard of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them intended to stick around long term. I find the channel limit to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be particularly restrictive, as it hinders some use cases I'd envision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where large payment channels between two parties are useful and can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> also be used for routing LN payments. Large payments afaik can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> broken up into smaller ones without incurring too much cost or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trouble,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Splitting up large payments would require multiple invoices at least
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for now (whether this is troublesome or not may be a matter of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opinion, bit I suspect juggling more than a few invoices would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> painful as a user experience). Routing larger payments over multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> routes automatically while using a single invoice, is harder as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> multiple routes need to be set up, and each route must have different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> preimages: further it is likely you want the entire large payment to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be done atomically, which would be harder to arrange.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but that's not the case for creating channels. As the channel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> itself involves only two parties - and in sticking to my general
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> political/philosophical mantra - there is really no justification for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> limits to be imposed on this. Which brings me to my next point.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps our definition of &quot;long term&quot; is askew. A year after mainnet
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> release, I doubt anyone would feel safe implementing removal of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> limit; this is my &quot;long term&quot;.  Five years, I imagine quite a few will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use the nonlimited version and may form a subnetwork among
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> themselves.  But possibly by then it would be unlikely that most
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people using Bitcoin at all would evem be capable of putting 150 mBTC
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in spending money on a hot wallet, in which case whether there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 167 mBTC limit per channel or not is largely a moot point. Or perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I simply imagine hyperbitcoinization by then, with people putting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entire bitcoins into hot wallets equivalent to people putting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thousands of USD today in their back pockets as invitation to be attacked.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      There is also again the wisdom, that one should keep most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      funds in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      cold storage, and only a small amount for spending in hot wallets
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      Lightning nodes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is a top-down way of thinking that runs counter to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spirit of bitcoin. The &quot;wisest&quot; thing to do in fact may be to simply
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> buy inflation-adjusted treasury bonds and not mess with bitcoin at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all, much less the experimental lightning network. As advice this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perfectly fine to share with others for them to follow on a voluntary
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> basis, but I don't see why this ought to be enforced as a rule on a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> protocol level.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Possibly.  At the protocol level, a limit encourages the growth of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> network towards a mesh network rather than more central forms,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> however.  I merely put this since it is unlikely that most people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> following this &quot;wisdom&quot; would have an incentive to even run software
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with the limit removed: that is, by the time Lightning becomes fully
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deployed the limit may not even be reached in practice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I personally can't see a reason why a node would reject a large
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> channel being made with it, where is the downside or risk? The party
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> committing funds to the channel is the one risking loss or delay of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> funds.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But the party committing funds to the channel is known via node
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> gossip, and it is known also who the other end of the channel is. If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you were to propose opening for example a 5BTC channel to me with the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> funds coming from you, I would consider the possibility that I might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> get attacked in order to get to your funds (and I might not have the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> resources to protect against such an attack on my end, even if you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> might). Further, putting 5BTC implies that at some point there is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> future possibility, due to routing and so on, that the channel will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have around 5BTC belonging to me, and at some point before you can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spend the entire 5BTC I would want to close the channel and commit the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> funds that I now own into cold storage (so that the ability to channel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5BTC from you to me is a moot point).
