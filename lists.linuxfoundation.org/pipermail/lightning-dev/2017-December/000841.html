<PRE>Thank you - this is lots of information !)

&gt;<i> You would also have to make your outgoing channels private  (not sent by node gossip) so that others will not route through you.
</I>
If I would have only a single outgoing channel I would not have to
make it private ? Correct? There is no way to route through a node
that has one channel.

Another interesting question is what happens if I have lots of
channels, but in my software block all routing through my node?

Is there a way for me to block all routing through my node by
modifying node software but still enjoy all benefits of receiving and
sending deposits?

As you said, blocking all routing has lots of benefit since money is
safe if the network is down :-)

Sorry for playing devils advocate - I am just trying to understand it )

</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to route, and a channel depleted on your end is full on the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite end and you can still at least accept transactions toward you),
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise, you are better off closing channels (and incurring fees) so you
</I>&gt;<i> can recover the channel reserve).
