<PRE>Hi Ignatius,

welcome to the list :-)

&gt;<i> I'm a noob in bitcoin and lightning network, and several days ago I
</I>&gt;<i> just knew a concept called transaction batching, which is to pay
</I>&gt;<i> multiple payments with single transaction and single transaction fee,
</I>&gt;<i> which is much cheaper then doing multiple payments with multiple
</I>&gt;<i> transactions and multiple transaction fee. Now, is it possible to use
</I>&gt;<i> this thing to create multiple lightning channels with single
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, reducing transaction fee?
</I>
Absolutely, the protocol always refers to a channel by its short channel
ID (blockheight, transaction pos, output pos). So a single transaction
can fund multiple channels. I should however mention that this is
currently not implemented in any of the wallets, but it shouldn't be too
much of a problem to do so. The main problem is that in order to use
this you need to coordinate the fund-channel process for all channels in
parallel, so initially it's probably only going to be used to fund
channels from a single initiator.

Cheers,
Christian
