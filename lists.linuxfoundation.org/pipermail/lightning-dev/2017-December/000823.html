Thank you for your explanations.

It's good, though not as good as if both sender and recipient could set
their own fees.  I know it would have made everything more complicated but
receiving is actually more costly than sending. If you have less balance
than the initial opening of the channel, it is risk-free. But if you have
more than the initial state, you have to monitor if there are no old states
published.

Another trivial question: can the fee be negative? It might help with some
channel rebalancing.

I tried to get the information from BOLT #3 but BOLT's are very hard to
read if you are not an expert. Who pays for the closing of the channel? Is
it the person who initiates the closing? Since opening and closing fees are
probably going to be larger than lifetime channel fees, it is much more
important than the LN fees. I worry about a scenario that I create a
channel (paying fees), send some funds through the channel to have the
channel available also for receiving and the other side of the channel,
simply cashes out the balance, and I'm without the channel  opening fees
and with no receiving channel.

Best,

Edward
