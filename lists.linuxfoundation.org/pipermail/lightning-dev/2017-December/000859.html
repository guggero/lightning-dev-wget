&gt;<i> What's the rational for using millisatoshis as the units for lightning 
</I>&gt;<i> channels? Aren't you going to loose up to 1/2 of a satoshi when the 
</I>&gt;<i> channel is closed?
</I>
You can lose up to 0.999 satoshi per in-progress payment, yes.  BOLT #3:

    The amounts for each output MUST be rounded down to whole satoshis.

&gt;<i> Is this because it doesn't hurt and you might as well 
</I>&gt;<i> be open to the opportunity for these sub satoshi transactions, because 
</I>&gt;<i> if you aren't, you are giving up the opportunity to get accumulated 
</I>&gt;<i> revenue from many of those small transactions, that could end up being 
</I>&gt;<i> greater than 1/2 of a satoshi?
</I>
In practice, payments of less than a few thousand satoshi are
impractical, as they cost more than that to spend.  Channel closing
costs dwarf the gains to be made from cheating, however.

&gt;<i> Since millisatoshis is used, is there a maximum channel funding size?
</I>
Yes, the upper 32 bits must be zero, from BOLT #2:

  - for channels with `chain_hash` identifying the Bitcoin blockchain:
    - MUST set the four most significant bytes of `amount_msat` to 0.

This gives a maximum HTLC value of .04294967295 BTC, which, back when
we started, was about $10.

&gt;<i> Is the optional initial push of millisatoshis during the channel 
</I>&gt;<i> creation there in order to motivate the other party to be willing to 
</I>&gt;<i> waste their time with the channel creation in the first place? If not, 
</I>&gt;<i> what's it for?
</I>
It's for the common case where you want to connect to someone and
make a payment immediately.  I'm not sure how widely it will be used,
though.  It's also the only mechanism for the payer to have *zero* funds
in channel (ie. below reserve).

&gt;<i> In all of the clients that I've looked at, I can't seem to find out how 
</I>&gt;<i> to define the timeout closing out a channel when someone does not 
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate. Is there a fixed value for this as part of the protocol? Or 
</I>&gt;<i> do most clients have a default that they enforce over all channels that 
</I>&gt;<i> they create?
</I>
If there's no in-progress payment, there's no reason to close a channel
to an unreachable peer, unless you want to abandon the channel and get
the funds back.

If there is, BOLT #2 has you covered:

Hope that helps,
Rusty.
