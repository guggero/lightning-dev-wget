</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      *

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             to 0.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     This gives a maximum HTLC value of .04294967295 BTC, which, back when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     we started, was about $10.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What's the point of wasting the upper 32 bits? Seems like this is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waste of data?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The specs are intended to eventually support other similar 
</I>&gt;<i> cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin.  For those currencies, payments of 
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of whole coins may be practical, and thus the 0.042 limit is 
</I>&gt;<i> not imposed.  For Bitcoin only, the limit is applied.  This simplifies 
</I>&gt;<i> the design of software by only imposing a limit to a large field under 
</I>&gt;<i> certain conditions (i.e. for Bitcoin) while retaining the same format 
</I>&gt;<i> for all coins. Other cryptocurrencies may have different imposed 
</I>&gt;<i> limits when Lightning gets around to those.
</I>
It seems like you are making assumptions about the purchasing power of 
certain cryptocurrencies. Why even bother doing this? You have no idea 
what the future holds. Why set a limit for any cryptocurrency that might 
use lightning?

Even if you are right about the purchasing power of a particular 
cryptocurrency, why is a limit needed at all? If I have an high, bi 
weekly paid salary, and I have a low budget lifestyle, let's say I save 
90% of my income. It seems like your assumed limits could require 
multiple payments and multiple open channels for each bi weekly payment. 
What if I want to buy a boat, do you expect me to make payments from a 
lot of different channels? I was kind of under the assumption that the 
long term goal of lightning was only to have a few on chain payments per 
human per year.

Or, are you just worried right now because lightning isn't well tested?



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you have the lower 32 bits of data to use, and 2^32=4,294,967,296,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then you have 4,294,967,296 milli satoshis. 1 BTC=10^11 milli satoshis,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so 4,294,967,296 milli satoshis/((10^11 milli satoshis)/1BTC) =
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0.04294967296 BTC. That is off by 1 milli satoshi from what you say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above. Why is this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have an off-by-one error.  The largest number representable by 32 
</I>&gt;<i> bits is 2^32 - 1, not 2^32.
</I>
Okay, thanks for the clarification.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regardless of the discrepancy of 1 milli satoshi, it still seems like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0.04294967296 BTC is kind of a low maximum channel size for a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business applications. Why do you want to limit this when you have those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra 4 bytes set to zero? You think any more is too much to safely have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a hot wallet? You felt keeping it low will encourage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decentralization? Something else?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the channel size.  This is the payment size limit.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> channel size limit is 0.16777215 BTC, or 16777215 satoshi (2^24 - 1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A single payment can be up to 0.04294967295, but a channel is up to 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.16777215.
</I>
Okay, so why bother making these two amounts different?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is the max HTLC value the same as the maximum channel size?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Is the optional initial push of millisatoshis during the channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         creation there in order to motivate the other party to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         willing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         waste their time with the channel creation in the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         place? If not,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         what's it for?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It's for the common case where you want to connect to someone and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         make a payment immediately. I'm not sure how widely it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         be used,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         though. It's also the only mechanism for the payer to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         /zero/ funds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         in channel (ie. below reserve).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why would you ever want to start up a channel and immediately have zero
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funds in reserve? If you are doing that, why not just make a blockchain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transaction?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An exchange might support this.  You buy for example 100USD worth of 
</I>&gt;<i> BTC and indicate a desire to open a new channel between your node to 
</I>&gt;<i> the exchange's.  The exchange opens the channel with your node and 
</I>&gt;<i> specifies the push_msat equivalent of 100USD minus fees to your node.  
</I>&gt;<i> The exchange will want to do this because your new channel goes 
</I>&gt;<i> directly to the exchange and it can earn routing fees from your 
</I>&gt;<i> spending.  Presumably you want to do this so that you can spend your 
</I>&gt;<i> 100USD on Lightning for things within a short time frame.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The alternative is to send the money from the exchange onchain to you, 
</I>&gt;<i> then for your node to open a new channel (not necessarily to the 
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, too, so the exchange loses the routing fees) with the 
</I>&gt;<i> onchain funds.  This is two onchain transactions (from exchange to 
</I>&gt;<i> you, and from your node to a Lightning channel), unlike the case where 
</I>&gt;<i> the exchange does a single open and reassigns the funds to you via 
</I>&gt;<i> push_msat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both you and the exchange would want to do this: the exchange wants 
</I>&gt;<i> this so it can capture your routing fees, you want this so that you do 
</I>&gt;<i> not even touch the chain at all and start out in Lightning in the 
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>
Okay, so all this feature is doing is saving the extra step of making an 
initial payment? Just saving a little time, and not a monumental or 
required feature?

Thanks,
Andy Schroder
