<PRE>I see - thank you.

How to I discover nodes - is there any UI to see nodes currently
running on the network ?

&gt;<i> 3.  How do I find out if someone wants to connect to me?
</I>&gt;<i> The node connects to yours and sends channel funding messages.
</I>
In this case there is some kind of an UI where I can accept or reject - correct?
Or I auto-accept everyone that connects to me?

&gt;<i> If you intend to connect for the purpose of becoming a hub and earning routing fees, if you have some onchain bitcoins you can afford to invest, then it is to your interest to channel with  relatively new and low-connectivity nodes.
</I>
If I become a hub, how much to I earn, approximately in routing fees?
Is it a percentage of transactions? Are routing fees the same for all
hubs?

If I am connecting to the network and see many hubs - how can I select
which hub to connect to?  Is there any performance/reputation info
available for any hub?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1. How do I select the nodes to peer with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By whatever selection criteria you wish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, lnd offers an &quot;auto-pilot&quot; where it selects peers to channel
</I>&gt;<i> with automatically using some heuristic (which I do not know).  My
</I>&gt;<i> understanding, c-lightning will eventually offer a similar feature at some
</I>&gt;<i> point in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably node gossip will let you learn of other nodes that you might
</I>&gt;<i> channel with in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2. How do I make them to do deposits - ideally I want them to match $100
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, channels are initially single-funded.  There is a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184</A> for dual-funded
</I>&gt;<i> channel setup, but did not make it into 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But since they are presumably already sufficiently connected to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the network, why would they lock more funds?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It helps to consider that you are not particularly special, and neither are
</I>&gt;<i> the existing nodes on the network particularly special.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a reason to open a channel to an arbitrary node, then other
</I>&gt;<i> nodes have a reason to open a channel to an arbitrary node, which might be
</I>&gt;<i> you.  Even if the network grows large, that also means there are more
</I>&gt;<i> participants who might decide, via whatever heuristic, to channel to your
</I>&gt;<i> node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you intend to connect for the purpose of becoming a hub and earning
</I>&gt;<i> routing fees, if you have some onchain bitcoins you can afford to invest,
</I>&gt;<i> then it is to your interest to channel with relatively new and
</I>&gt;<i> low-connectivity nodes. Such nodes might receive payments and if you are one
</I>&gt;<i> of the few routes (or the only route) you then get a higher chance of being
</I>&gt;<i> routed through.  Inverting this, if you have a new node with a few channels,
</I>&gt;<i> others aspiring to become hubs will want to lock spare funds to channel to
</I>&gt;<i> your node in case you become a very prolific user (sender or receiver) of
</I>&gt;<i> the network in the future.
