<PRE>Hello ZmnSCPxj!

You are completely right in saying that LDR presents a bigger barrier in
the sense that It needs to be running on literally every node in a payment
path for it to work whereas 'feeadjuster' can help the sender even if only
one node in the payment path is running it. That is definitely a big LDR
disadvantage.
About the specs... My approach was thinking about LDR as an independent
protocol with an independent protocol specification which would be
implemented by software that run alongside a spec-compliant lightning node,
which is why I was saying that there is no need for a lightning-spec change.
I started trying to define this new specification it on an extended version
of the paper, it's available here:

Also started (early beginnings!) to write the LDR-spec compliant software,
targeting lnd and bitcoind: <A HREF="https://github.com/jsmvalente/ldRouting">https://github.com/jsmvalente/ldRouting</A>

Kind regards,

&gt;<i> Good morning Joao,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello ZmnSCPxj,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for taking the time to read the paper and sending over some
</I>&gt;<i> feedback, can't stress enough how important that is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I took a look at the `feeadjuster` plugin for C-Lightning and although
</I>&gt;<i> it goes in the same direction as LDR in the sense that it allows for better
</I>&gt;<i> routes by signalling channel balance availability. It does it through a
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic fee adjustment though, where LDR is more explicit and goes one step
</I>&gt;<i> further, directly sharing channel balance information. I'm not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> these two solutions would compare in practice though but I imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> sharing more information would give LDR a performance edge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, and there's no need for a spec change. It could work as a separated
</I>&gt;<i> LN overlay network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe it would --- either you write the code for this overlay network
</I>&gt;<i> for all extant node software (though I suppose targeting lnd will get you
</I>&gt;<i> 90% of the network anyway...), or you standardize so all implementations
</I>&gt;<i> are going to target implementing the overlay network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, using fees as the signaling just reuses an existing
</I>&gt;<i> signaling layer, and affects payers in the expected ways --- all existing
</I>&gt;<i> implementations already try to minimize fees, so signaling a low fee when
</I>&gt;<i> you have high capacity on a channel already does the &quot;right thing&quot; on the
</I>&gt;<i> network today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, by using fees as a signaling layer you can get something like
</I>&gt;<i> this partly working for most payers today even if only a small number of
</I>&gt;<i> nodes run `feeadjuster` or CLBOSS, whereas with LDR you need most payers to
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade to using the new overlay network in order to get similar benefit, I
</I>&gt;<i> think, in which case you should really push to standardize it in the specs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
