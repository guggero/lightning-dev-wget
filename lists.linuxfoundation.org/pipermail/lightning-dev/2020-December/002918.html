</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems difficult to recommend YOLO commitment transactions becoming the standard way to recover funds. It could be preferable to the current system but even that is up for debate I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I feel like I can recommend oblivious settlements because (i) it's covert (like YOLO commitments txs unlike current system) and (ii) it's  &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; -- you are guaranteed to recover the funds that you are presented with once you finally trigger the recovery
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Off list Dave correctly pointed out to me that this wasn't a very clear picture of the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> After some thought, I came up with these claims that I think I can make strongly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Before you reveal that you are doing recovery you are guaranteed to have a tx in hand that:
</I>&gt;<i>      i. You can broadcast first
</I>&gt;<i>      ii. You can choose the fee to be as high as you like
</I>&gt;<i>      iii. Is not replaceable.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If the malicious party is *not* willing to risk broadcasting a revoked tx then you are guaranteed to recover the face value of the transaction(s) you have in hand.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. An honest party is never at risk of broadcasting a revoked commitment tx.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. You never have to reveal that you were doing a recovery i.e. the channel can continue (strictly preferable to 1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current system has: 3
</I>&gt;<i> Oblivious mutual close has: 1,2,3
</I>&gt;<i> YOLO commitments has: 1,5
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the question of YOLO commitments vs oblivious mutual close is whether paying the price of losing (2,3) is worth the upgrade from (1) to (5).
</I>&gt;<i> The concern with (1) is that once you broadcast to the network the obliviously transferred &quot;mutual close&quot; transaction, the malicious party then has a hint that you have lost data and they can try and broadcast a favourable revoked transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> This should be very hard since in (1) you broadcast first, can choose as large a fee as you like and the tx does not signal replaceability whereas the revoked tx *will* signal replaceability.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also personally trying to avoid losing (3) because to keep [1] applicable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note: in YOLO commitment transactions you have to recover some additional metadata from the other party -- in particular the compressed revocation keys that you *should* know otherwise the channel cannot continue to operate. So a signature on the compressed revocation keys must be given to the other party before you lose data and returned to you when you are given the commitment transaction upon reconnection.
</I>&gt;<i> This should be easy enough to do though.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The idea I'm working with in revocable signature based channels [1] is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to make the node lose its static secret key if it posts a revoked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; commitment tx. This means they could lose ALL funds from ALL their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channels with ALL their peers if they ever broadcast a single revoked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; commitment transaction. This would be a very bad thing to happen while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you're trying to recover funds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yikes!  A very bad thing indeed.  I'll have to re-read about witness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asymmetric channels; I don't think I realized that was a consequence of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's an optional feature -- see link[1] above where I just added an explanation of it.
</I>&gt;<i> I actually see no reason why you couldn't apply revocable signatures to transaction asymmetric channels (LN as it is today) you just have to overhaul the revocation mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general I agree with your points that side-channels may be effective tools to reveal whether a node has had data loss or not.
</I>&gt;<i> I think in both YOLO commitments and oblivious mutual close it is easy enough to simulate data-loss up to a point to try and catch malicious peers using side channels.
</I>&gt;<i> At least you don't have to ask the peer to broadcast a tx to find out!
