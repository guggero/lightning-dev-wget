<PRE>Hey Lloyd (and others),

I have just been working on something similar. I came up with the following
plan of attack that works within the current protocol:

Create a static channel backup after the fact. I have dubbed this a
synthetic static channel backup. I only use it to trigger the data loss
protection protocol.
By restoring this synthetic SCB a `channel_reestablish` is being sent to
the remote peer. This `channel_reestablish`contains the
`next_commitment_number`and the `next_revocation_number` both set to zero.
This triggers the remote peer to force close the channel dropping its
current commitment transaction to the chain. Using the
`per_commitment_point` received from the remote peer you can now derive the
private key needed for sweeping your funds, using
privkey = basepoint_secret + SHA256(per_commitment_point || basepoint)

We use the basepoint_secret derived (in LND) with

```
basePointSecret, err := keyRing.DerivePrivKey(keychain.KeyDescriptor{
  KeyLocator: keychain.KeyLocator{
    Family: keychain.KeyFamilyPaymentBase,
    Index:  0, // Same commitment index as used by the remote node
  },
})
```

I have  got this somewhat working in a test setup. (I probably have
overlooked some details). I would be interested in hearing Sjors Provoost
on this, since his question and answer on this topic over on the Bitcoin
StackExchange was really helpful.[1]
He lost his backup in a boating accident as well. (What is it with you guys
and boating? :) )

Your approach covers more cases, and my approach only fits certain edge
cases. But my approach is possible today, without changes to the Lightning
protocol.

Regards,

Gijs

&gt;<i> Hi list,

</I>&gt;<i> I've been considering the problem of recovering lightning channels after
</I>&gt;<i> losing channel state in a boating accident. The modern way of doing this
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be &quot;static channel backups&quot; -- these are essentially lists of
</I>&gt;<i> channel ids and the nodes you had the channels with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is that with this backup you can remember who you had channels

</I>&gt;<i> link me the concrete protocol messages you send to do this?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It occurred to me that if the lightning protocol were changed slightly you
</I>&gt;<i> could do this without the channel backup at all. Consider the open channel
</I>&gt;<i> message and its two fields `funding_pubkey` and `temporary_channel_id`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#the-open_channel-message">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#the-open_channel-message</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason `temporary_channel_id` is necessarily &quot;temporary&quot; is because we
</I>&gt;<i> don't know the other party's `funding_pubkey`. Instead I propose using
</I>&gt;<i> deterministically randomized version of the node's static public key as the
</I>&gt;<i> `funding_pubkey` so we know it up front. Specifically, when opening a
</I>&gt;<i> channel with a remote node, do a Diffie-Hellman operation with their public
</I>&gt;<i> key and use the resulting shared secret to deterministically produce
</I>&gt;<i> scalars r1 and r2 and use 2-of-2(r1*G + P_local, r2*P_remote) as the script
</I>&gt;<i> pubkey of funding output. Now we know what the funding output would look
</I>&gt;<i> like with any node without interacting with them. Of course, to open
</I>&gt;<i> multiple channels with the same node we would have to generate a new shared
</I>&gt;<i> secret from each one by hashing a counter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that we can figure out what our funding outputs with each node look
</I>&gt;<i> like non-interactively, when we lose our channel state we can find them in
</I>&gt;<i> the UTXO set as long as we can recreate a list of node's we may have had
</I>&gt;<i> channels with. For most non-enterprise users (such as myself) this can be
</I>&gt;<i> done automatically because we exclusively have channels with well known
</I>&gt;<i> reliable public nodes whose public keys can be discovered through routing
</I>&gt;<i> gossip or from public indexes. Therefore if I can just restore my node's
</I>&gt;<i> keypair from my seed I should be able to scan the network for nodes and
</I>&gt;<i> figure out if I have channels open with them and then carry out the
</I>&gt;<i> recovery process. From my perspective this seems to be a rather nice
</I>&gt;<i> improvement in user experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
