<PRE>After posting I was tapped on the shoulder and informed that it is very
likely that we will have an enhanced secure parallel composition 2 round
MuSig in the future.
This is really good news.
This makes much of the post moot but I think the conclusion about being
able to do &quot;pure scriptless&quot; lightning with the same number of rounds as
today before forwarding the payment is correct.

Cheers,

LL

&gt;<i> Hi list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> tl;dr: I think can use two round MuSig safely in the context of lightning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a recap, Zeeman did a good evaluation of &quot;purely scriptless&quot; lightning
</I>&gt;<i> channels after taproot/schnorr.[1]
</I>&gt;<i> Z concluded that even in the most optimized case the 3 round MuSig
</I>&gt;<i> protocol leads to an extra round of communication before you can forward a
</I>&gt;<i> payment.
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is correct but perhaps you could just use 2 round MuSig
</I>&gt;<i> (without MuSig-DN magic[4]).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> === 2 round MuSig ===
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (from memory) The original MuSig paper suggested the following signing
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm once two keys A and B have already been established for Alice and
</I>&gt;<i> Bob
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice                                           Bob
</I>&gt;<i> pick ra randomly
</I>&gt;<i> Ra = ra * G
</I>&gt;<i>                           ----- Ra ----&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>                                                 pick rb randomly
</I>&gt;<i>                                                 Rb = rb * G
</I>&gt;<i>                                                 let c = H(Ra + Rb || A + B
</I>&gt;<i> || m)
</I>&gt;<i>                                                 sb = rb + cb
</I>&gt;<i>                           &lt;--Rb, sb----
</I>&gt;<i> s = sb + ra + ca
</I>&gt;<i> R = Ra + Rb
</I>&gt;<i> X = A + B
</I>&gt;<i> verify(X, (R, s), m)?
</I>&gt;<i> output: (R,s)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was insecure under *parallel composition* because the proof cannot
</I>&gt;<i> work (from my memory because having open signing sessions makes the
</I>&gt;<i> rewinding argument in the proof incoherent) and led to actual attacks which
</I>&gt;<i> have recently improved in efficiency.[3]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> === My insight ===
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 round MuSig *is secure* under sequential composition and in a lightning
</I>&gt;<i> channel we are essentially arranging sequential state updates so perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> we're ok here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be easy to require that you can't open another signing session
</I>&gt;<i> until we've finished the current session.
</I>&gt;<i> Also if Alice has sent Ra there is no reason that Bob can't send multiple
</I>&gt;<i> (Rb, sb) pairs for different messages for the same Ra while he wants for
</I>&gt;<i> Alice to respond.
</I>&gt;<i> Alice doesn't have to finish the signature yet she can just store the most
</I>&gt;<i> recent one and finish if/when she needs to.
</I>&gt;<i> This preserves the current update communication structure of lightning
</I>&gt;<i> without breaking the security requirements of 2 round MuSig.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> === How could PTLCs work ===
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Updating states is more than just signing the commitment transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's assume we do PTLCs with both a PTLC-success and PTLC-timeout
</I>&gt;<i> pre-signed transaction (I don't see how else to do it) on *both* sides of
</I>&gt;<i> the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> This means you have to pre-share the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A fresh pair of nonces for every existing PTLC in the state plus one
</I>&gt;<i> extra (must be done every update)
</I>&gt;<i> - A key for every existing PTLC in the state plus one extra (can be fixed
</I>&gt;<i> at the start of the channel or updated as you go along).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After pre-sharing this data Bob starts the communication with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (the postfix *-alice and *-bob means that they are in the tree of
</I>&gt;<i> transactions on alice or bob's side, not necessarily that alice or bob is
</I>&gt;<i> the one broadcasting it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bob sends:
</I>&gt;<i>     - new PTLC details
</I>&gt;<i>     - (Rb,sb)-success(s)-bob (uses pre-shared nonce)
</I>&gt;<i>     - (Rb,sb)-success(s)-alice (uses pre-shared nonce)
</I>&gt;<i>     - (Rb)-commit-bob
</I>&gt;<i>     - (Rb)-timeout(s)-bob
</I>&gt;<i>     - (Rb)-timeout(s)-alice
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice sends back:
</I>&gt;<i>     -  (Ra,sa)-timeout(s)-bob
</I>&gt;<i>     -  (Ra,sa)-timeout(s)-alice
</I>&gt;<i>     -  (Ra,sa)-commit-bob
</I>&gt;<i>     -  (Ra)-commit-alice
</I>&gt;<i> Bob sends:
</I>&gt;<i>     - (Rb,sb)-commit-alice
</I>&gt;<i>     - revocation key for last commitment
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **Note that Alice still hasn't revoked her last state but at this point
</I>&gt;<i> she can safely forward the PTLC since Bob has revoked his last state.**
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other notes:
</I>&gt;<i> - This is and looks convoluted but it is simpler if you use witness
</I>&gt;<i> asymmetry[2] because it removes duplicating the party's transactions across
</I>&gt;<i> both sides.
</I>&gt;<i> - Although you are doing parallel signing on the PTLC output key (you are
</I>&gt;<i> signing both a timeout and success) a different party is receiving the
</I>&gt;<i> signature and the nonces are communicated in reverse so it actually
</I>&gt;<i> sidesteps the flaw of two round MuSig (where the adversary is always
</I>&gt;<i> declaring his nonce second and second).
</I>&gt;<i> - For protocols such as DLCs you will have to do proper three round MuSig
</I>&gt;<i> but you are not forwarding payments so it's not as time sensitive.
</I>&gt;<i> - I am completely avoiding revocation mechanisms here but from my own
</I>&gt;<i> ideas and what I've seen from others this is compatible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> === Claim Summary ===
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the above, I claim there is a protocol using two-round MuSig for
</I>&gt;<i> fully scriptless lightning that incurs no extra rounds of communication to
</I>&gt;<i> get to the irrevocably committed state.
</I>&gt;<i> It does incur extra storage for each PTLC in the present commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> It includes an extra round to &quot;fully&quot; update the state between two parties
</I>&gt;<i> (but this does not delay payment forwarding).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't claim that this is the optimal path forward but just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> make this observation to see what others thought.
