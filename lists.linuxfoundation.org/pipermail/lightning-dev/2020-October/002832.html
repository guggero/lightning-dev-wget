&gt;<i> This hold fee could be: lock_time * (fee_base + fee_rate * htlc_value).
</I>&gt;<i> fee_base is in there to compensate for the usage of an htlc slot, which is
</I>&gt;<i> a scarce resource too.
</I>
...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In both cases the sender needs to trust its peer to not steal the payment
</I>&gt;<i> and/or artificially delay the forwarding to inflate the hold fee. I think
</I>&gt;<i> that is acceptable given that there is a trust relation between peers
</I>&gt;<i> already anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A crucial thing is that these hold fees don't need to be symmetric. A new
</I>&gt;<i> node for example that opens a channel to a well-known, established routing
</I>&gt;<i> node will be forced to pay a hold fee, but won't see any traffic coming in
</I>&gt;<i> anymore if it announces a hold fee itself. Nodes will need to build a
</I>&gt;<i> reputation before they're able to command hold fees. Similarly, routing
</I>&gt;<i> nodes that have a strong relation may decide to not charge hold fees to
</I>&gt;<i> each other at all.
</I>
I can still establish channels to various low-reputation nodes, and then
use them to grief a high-reputation node.  Not only do I get to jam up
the high-reputation channels, as a bonus I get the low-reputation nodes
to pay for it!

Operators of high reputation nodes can even make this profitable; doubly
so, since they eliminate the chance of any of those low-reputation nodes
every getting to be high reputation (and thus competing).

AFAICT any scheme which penalizes the direct peer creates a bias against
forwarding unknown payments, thus is deanonymizing.

&gt;<i> I'd also like to encourage everyone to prioritize this spam/jam issue and
</I>&gt;<i> dedicate more time to solving it. Obviously there is a lot more to do in
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning, but I am not sure if we can afford to wait for the real
</I>&gt;<i> adversaries to show up on this one.
</I>
Agreed.  It's a classic &quot;it's not actually on fire *right now*&quot; problem,
so it does keep getting pushed back.

Cheers,
Rusty.
