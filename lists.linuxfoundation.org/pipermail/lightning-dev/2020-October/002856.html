<PRE># Problem

A lightning node must verify that its channel transactions are not only
consensus-valid but also tx-relay standard. The counterparty signatures are
part of the local txn (commitment/HTLC) as provided in the
`commitment_signed`. Verifying consensus-validity of these signatures but
not their tx-relay standardness, let an attacker provoke a permanent
tx-relay failure of the victim transactions. The attacker can steal
in-flight HTLCs once they expire as the victim can't trustlessly claim them
onchain during the CLTV delay.

Bitcoin ECDSA signatures are made of the scalar pair (R, S). Since Bitcoin
Core 0.10 [0], high-S (above curve order / 2) signatures aren't standard
and thus any transaction containing one won't be relayed/mined on the
regular p2p network. Note, that this check isn't part of consensus rules
even if it has been proposed to be soft-forked [1].

Prior to v0.10, LND would have accepted counterparty high-S signature and
broadcast tx-relay invalid local commitment/HTLC transactions. This can be
exploited by any peer with an already open channel whatever victim
situation (routing node, payment-receiver, payment-sender [2]).

Contrary to other Lightning implementations, LND uses
`btcd.btcec.signature` for verifying counterparty signatures at commitment
signed exchange. This go package relies itself on the default golang crypto
ecdsa package. It differs from libsecp256k1, as the verification method
doesn't enforce the lower-S form of the signature, thus a libsecp256k1
signature validity is tighter than a golang ecdsa package one.

The `btcec` serialization code was correctly normalizing signature to low-S
but this step wasn&#8217;t included when that code was brought into LND&#8217;s
`lnwire`.

Note, that LND didn't suffer from this vulnerability on opening/closing as
it was relying on btcd.txscript witness verification method with the
correct standard flags, enforcing low-S signatures.

Note that Bitcoin Core (`CPubKey::Verify`) always normalizes signatures
before passing them to libsecp256k1 verification method which
unconditionally enforces low-S (`secp256k1_ecdsa_verify`).

# Solution

As ECDSA signatures are inherently malleable, even if the counterparty
provides a high-S signature it can be normalized by the receiver to a
tx-relay standard one.

A more proactive solution is to fail the channel at any reception of a
high-S signature as it's a clear signal that your counterparty is either
malicious or buggy (most bitcoin softwares generates low-S signature since
a while [3]).

For now, the first solution has been adopted by the LND team. A spec change
has been proposed to make the second a requirement.

# Background

A lightning node security underlies the assumption to be always able to
unilaterally broadcast channel transactions in the aim to timely confirm
them on-chain to enforce an off-chain negotiated balance.

It must be remembered that channel transactions are asymmetric, thus each
party owns a different version including all parties's balances/HTLCs. To
broadcast its version, a party must own a valid witness at any time.

For commitment transactions, the witness stack is the following :

0 &lt;localfunding_sig&gt; &lt;remotefunding_sig&gt;

For HTLC-Success:

0 &lt;remotehtlc_sig&gt; &lt;localhtlc_sig&gt; &lt;payment_preimage&gt;

For HTLC-Timeout:

0 &lt;remotehtlc_sig&gt; &lt;localhtlc_sig&gt; &lt;&gt; (empty vector)

The &lt;remotefunding_sig&gt;/&lt;remotehtlc_sig&gt; are the ones which might have been
maliciously malleated by an attacker.

These signatures are provided at channels updated by a counterparty's
`commitment signed`. Once it's accepted, the local node must release the
revocation secret for the previous channel state, thus relying on the
validity of highest state transactions for its funds' safety.

These transactions must be unilaterally broadcasted in case of reaching the
off-chain resolution deadline for [4]:
* offered HTLCs for a routing/original sender
* received HTLCs for a routing/last receiver

Note, this off-chain resolution deadline even if it's expressed as block
height it's not equal to a HTLC absolute timelock but must always be
inferior. It offers a block buffer for a local node to broadcast, fee-bump
and hopefully confirm its transactions.

A non-standard transaction can still be confirmed by out-of-band agreement
with a miner or a user intervention to correct the transaction if possible.
In the case of Lightning, the security model doesn't assume this kind of
user intervention and deployed timelocks would have been too short for a
reasonable intervention of a node operator.

# Discovery

While working on Rust-Lightning, I observed that the implementation was
generating MINIMALIF-invalid transactions due to a regression. This case
wasn't covered by our test framework as there is no easy-to-integrate
utility to test transaction standardness. After patching the spec, to
recall the MINIMALIF requirement on some channel transactions witnesses
[5], I audited deployed Lightning implementations w.r.t to Core script
interpreter policy flags. A quick test against LND (65f5119) revealed this
vulnerability.

After informing the LND team, I also informed the c-lightning and Eclair
teams. Even if this vulnerability is implementation specific, the tx-relay
standardness issues it underscored could have been failed by other
implementations. Thus an urgency fix by one of the team could have revealed
easy-to-exploit weaknesses in other in-production implementations. As the
vulnerability involves language-specific serializers and dependencies, it's
a hard task to evaluate correctness of an implementation without alerting
the concerned developers teams. For the future, it would be better to have
a clearer Lightning-wise coordination policy [6].

Note, that we agreed with the LND team for a 6-month embargo period, the
double of channel funding check CVEs. As the Lightning ecosystem is
maturing, the funds at stake are also growing. It should be minded how much
Lightning software is sensible compared to other security/cryptographic
software (e.g TLS). The high-stake nodes are known, channel connections are
mostly open, they're operating on top of a public infrastructure (the
Bitcoin network) and the codebases are fully open source. Lightning node
operators are running a Bitcoin bank in the plainsight, any failure might
be observed and exploited by an attacker.

I'm eager to engage the wider Lightning community on what a reasonable
vulnerability embargo should endure, both incentivizing dev teams to
proactively fix their security vulnerabilities while minding a wide range
of users, from business to hobbyists.

# Ecosystem Implications

This vulnerability is a case of a transaction standardness malleability.
Transaction standardness is a set of supplementary anti-DoS rules on top of
Bitcoin consensus rules. For e.g, MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE or
MINIMALIF-compliant witnesses. This set of rules isn't well-defined as it's
part of a full-node policy, which varies across implementations and
versions.

There is no _a_ tx-relay policy but as many tx-relay policies as there are
full-node deployed as some checks might be tightened by node settings. This
fact is acknowledged by LN devs since a while who are most of the time
testing channel transactions standardness against the latest Core release,
for lack of better.

This situation is concerning and sound to have been an undersight during
Lightning/payment channels protocols design. The transaction standardness
surface is quite wide, and any standardness fault, either accidental or
malicious triggered, can provoke a loss of funds for a LN node.

Further, this tx-relay standardness issue has a wider echo as other
time-sensitive multi-party protocols (e.g vaults/CoinSwaps) are affected.
All Bitcoin software implementing this class of protocols must correctly
sanitize counterparty contribution, to avoid jeopardizing funds security or
introducing easy DoS (e.g a dual-funded channel with counterparty
non-standard input) [7]

At the Bitcoin base layer, a tighter, new tx-relay standard rule could
potentially break the security of all these off-chain protocols and thus be
deployed silently without anyone realizing before it's an easy
exploitation. As of today, tx-relay standardness fog is a systematic risk
for layer 2 protocols relying on time-sensitive transactions and I engage
the wider Bitcoin ecosystem to address it.
