<PRE>Hey Zman,

raising the minimum payment size is another headache
&gt;<i>
</I>
It's true that it may (depending on the algorithm) lower the success rate
of MPP-split.
But it's already a parameter that node operators can configure at will (at
channel creation time),
so IMO it's a complexity we have to deal with anyway. Making it dynamic
shouldn't have a high
impact on MPP algorithms (apart from failures while `channel_update`s are
propagating).

To be fully honest, my (maybe unpopular) opinion about MPP is that it's not
necessary on the
network's backbone, only at its edges. Once the network matures, I expect
channels between
&quot;serious&quot; routing nodes to be way bigger than the size of individual
payments. The only places
where there may be small or almost-empty channels are between end-users
(wallets) and
routing nodes.
If something like Trampoline were to be implemented, MPP would only be
needed to reach a
first routing node (short route), that routing node would aggregate the
parts and forward as a
single HTLC to the next routing node. It would be split again once it
reaches the other edge
of the network (for a short route as well). In a network like this, the MPP
routes would only have
to be computed on a small subset of the network, which makes brute-force
algorithms completely
reasonable and the success rate higher.

This is an interesting fork of the discussion, but I don't think it's a
good reason to prevent these
parameters from being updated on live channels, what do you think?

Le jeu. 8 oct. 2020 &#224; 22:05, ZmnSCPxj &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">ZmnSCPxj at protonmail.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Good morning t-bast,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please forget about channel jamming, upfront fees et al and simply
</I>&gt;<i> consider the parameters I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mentioning. It feels to me that these are by nature dynamic channel
</I>&gt;<i> parameters (some of them are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even present in `channel_update`, but no-one updates them yet because
</I>&gt;<i> direct peers don't take the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update into account anyway). I'd like to raise `htlc_minimum_msat` on
</I>&gt;<i> some big channels because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like these channels to be used only for big-ish payments. Today I
</I>&gt;<i> can't, I have to close that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channel and open a new one for such a trivial configuration update,
</I>&gt;<i> which is sad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the risk of once more derailing the conversation: from the MPP
</I>&gt;<i> trenches, raising the minimum payment size is another headache.
</I>&gt;<i> The general assumption with MPP is that smaller amounts are more likely to
</I>&gt;<i> get through, but if anyone is making a significant bump up in
</I>&gt;<i> `htlc_minimum_msat`, that assumption is upended and we have to reconsider
</I>&gt;<i> if we may actually want to merge multiple failing splits into one, as well
</I>&gt;<i> as considering asymmetric splits (in particular asymmetric presplits)
</I>&gt;<i> because maybe the smaller splits will be unable to pass through the bigger
</I>&gt;<i> channels but the bigger-side split *might*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand: one can consider that the use of big payments as an
</I>&gt;<i> aggregation.
</I>&gt;<i> For example: a forwarding node might support smaller `htlc_minimum_msat`,
</I>&gt;<i> then after making multiple such forwards, find that a channel is now
</I>&gt;<i> heavily balanced towards one side or another.
</I>&gt;<i> It can then make a single large rebalance via one of the
</I>&gt;<i> high-`htlc_minimum_msat` channels t-bast is running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
</I>&gt;<i>
