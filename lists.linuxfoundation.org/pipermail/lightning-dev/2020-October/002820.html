<PRE>Hi list,

tl;dr: I think can use two round MuSig safely in the context of lightning.

As a recap, Zeeman did a good evaluation of &quot;purely scriptless&quot; lightning
channels after taproot/schnorr.[1]
Z concluded that even in the most optimized case the 3 round MuSig protocol
leads to an extra round of communication before you can forward a payment.
I think this is correct but perhaps you could just use 2 round MuSig
(without MuSig-DN magic[4]).

=== 2 round MuSig ===

(from memory) The original MuSig paper suggested the following signing
algorithm once two keys A and B have already been established for Alice and
Bob

Alice                                           Bob
pick ra randomly
Ra = ra * G
                          ----- Ra ----&gt;
                                                pick rb randomly
                                                Rb = rb * G
                                                let c = H(Ra + Rb || A + B
||<i> m)
</I>                                                sb = rb + cb
                          &lt;--Rb, sb----
s = sb + ra + ca
R = Ra + Rb
X = A + B
verify(X, (R, s), m)?
output: (R,s)

This was insecure under *parallel composition* because the proof cannot
work (from my memory because having open signing sessions makes the
rewinding argument in the proof incoherent) and led to actual attacks which
have recently improved in efficiency.[3]

=== My insight ===

2 round MuSig *is secure* under sequential composition and in a lightning
channel we are essentially arranging sequential state updates so perhaps
we're ok here?

It should be easy to require that you can't open another signing session
until we've finished the current session.
Also if Alice has sent Ra there is no reason that Bob can't send multiple
(Rb, sb) pairs for different messages for the same Ra while he wants for
Alice to respond.
Alice doesn't have to finish the signature yet she can just store the most
recent one and finish if/when she needs to.
This preserves the current update communication structure of lightning
without breaking the security requirements of 2 round MuSig.

=== How could PTLCs work ===

Updating states is more than just signing the commitment transaction. Let's
assume we do PTLCs with both a PTLC-success and PTLC-timeout pre-signed
transaction (I don't see how else to do it) on *both* sides of the channel.
This means you have to pre-share the following:

- A fresh pair of nonces for every existing PTLC in the state plus one
extra (must be done every update)
- A key for every existing PTLC in the state plus one extra (can be fixed
at the start of the channel or updated as you go along).

After pre-sharing this data Bob starts the communication with:

(the postfix *-alice and *-bob means that they are in the tree of
transactions on alice or bob's side, not necessarily that alice or bob is
the one broadcasting it).

Bob sends:
    - new PTLC details
    - (Rb,sb)-success(s)-bob (uses pre-shared nonce)
    - (Rb,sb)-success(s)-alice (uses pre-shared nonce)
    - (Rb)-commit-bob
    - (Rb)-timeout(s)-bob
    - (Rb)-timeout(s)-alice

Alice sends back:
    -  (Ra,sa)-timeout(s)-bob
    -  (Ra,sa)-timeout(s)-alice
    -  (Ra,sa)-commit-bob
    -  (Ra)-commit-alice
Bob sends:
    - (Rb,sb)-commit-alice
    - revocation key for last commitment

**Note that Alice still hasn't revoked her last state but at this point she
can safely forward the PTLC since Bob has revoked his last state.**

Other notes:
- This is and looks convoluted but it is simpler if you use witness
asymmetry[2] because it removes duplicating the party's transactions across
both sides.
- Although you are doing parallel signing on the PTLC output key (you are
signing both a timeout and success) a different party is receiving the
signature and the nonces are communicated in reverse so it actually
sidesteps the flaw of two round MuSig (where the adversary is always
declaring his nonce second and second).
- For protocols such as DLCs you will have to do proper three round MuSig
but you are not forwarding payments so it's not as time sensitive.
- I am completely avoiding revocation mechanisms here but from my own ideas
and what I've seen from others this is compatible.

=== Claim Summary ===

Given the above, I claim there is a protocol using two-round MuSig for
fully scriptless lightning that incurs no extra rounds of communication to
get to the irrevocably committed state.
It does incur extra storage for each PTLC in the present commitment
transaction.
It includes an extra round to &quot;fully&quot; update the state between two parties
(but this does not delay payment forwarding).

I don't claim that this is the optimal path forward but just wanted to make
this observation to see what others thought.
