</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; A crucial thing is that these hold fees don't need to be symmetric. A new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; node for example that opens a channel to a well-known, established
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; node will be forced to pay a hold fee, but won't see any traffic coming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; anymore if it announces a hold fee itself. Nodes will need to build a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reputation before they're able to command hold fees. Similarly, routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; nodes that have a strong relation may decide to not charge hold fees to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; each other at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can still establish channels to various low-reputation nodes, and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use them to grief a high-reputation node.  Not only do I get to jam up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the high-reputation channels, as a bonus I get the low-reputation nodes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to pay for it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you're saying:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ATTACKER --(no hold fee)--&gt; LOW-REP --(hold fee)--&gt; HIGH-REP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I were LOW-REP, I'd still charge an unknown node a hold fee. I would
</I>&gt;<i> only waive the hold fee for high-reputation nodes. In that case, the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker is still paying for the attack. I may be forced to take a small
</I>&gt;<i> loss on the difference, but at least the larger part of the pain is felt by
</I>&gt;<i> the attacker. The assumption is that this is sufficient enough to deter the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker from even trying.
</I>
No, because HIGH-REP == ATTACKER and LOW-REP pays.

&gt;<i> I guess your concern is with trying to become a routing node? If nobody
</I>&gt;<i> knows you, you'll be forced to pay hold fees but can't attract traffic if
</I>&gt;<i> you charge hold fees yourself. That indeed means that you'll need to be
</I>&gt;<i> selective with whom you accept htlcs from. Put limits in place to control
</I>&gt;<i> the expenditure. Successful forwards will earn a routing fee which could
</I>&gt;<i> compensate for the loss in hold fees too.
</I>
&quot;Be selectinve with whom you accept HTLCs from&quot;... it always comes back
to incentives to de-anonymize the network :(

&gt;<i> I think this mechanism can create interesting dynamics on the network and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually reach an equilibrium that is still healthy in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> decentralization and privacy.
</I>
I suspect that if you try to create a set of actual rules for nodes
using actual numbers, I think you'll find you enter a complexity spiral
as you try to play whack-a-mole on all the different ways you can
exploit it.

(This is what happened every time I tried to design a peer-penalty
system).

Cheers,
Rusty.
