I think it's just how you defne channel's operations, either emptying out
all pending HTLCs or more a `update_fee` alike semantic. You're right that
the latter should be good enough for the set of parameters you're proposing.
A lightweight `update_policy` doesn't sound to bear difficulty at first
sight.

&gt;<i> Good morning Antoine and Zman,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your answers!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking dynamic policy adjustment would be covered by the dynamic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commitment mechanism proposed by Laolu
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't mention this as I think we still have a long-ish way to go before
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic commitments
</I>&gt;<i> are spec-ed, implemented and deployed, and I think the parameters I'm
</I>&gt;<i> interested in don't require
</I>&gt;<i> that complexity to be updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please forget about channel jamming, upfront fees et al and simply
</I>&gt;<i> consider the parameters I'm
</I>&gt;<i> mentioning. It feels to me that these are by nature dynamic channel
</I>&gt;<i> parameters (some of them are
</I>&gt;<i> even present in `channel_update`, but no-one updates them yet because
</I>&gt;<i> direct peers don't take the
</I>&gt;<i> update into account anyway). I'd like to raise `htlc_minimum_msat` on some
</I>&gt;<i> big channels because
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like these channels to be used only for big-ish payments. Today I
</I>&gt;<i> can't, I have to close that
</I>&gt;<i> channel and open a new one for such a trivial configuration update, which
</I>&gt;<i> is sad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no need to stop the channel's operations while you're updating
</I>&gt;<i> these parameters, since
</I>&gt;<i> they can be updated unilaterally anyway. The only downside is that if you
</I>&gt;<i> make your policy stricter,
</I>&gt;<i> your peer may send you some HTLCs that you will immediately fail
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards; it's only a minor
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenience that won't trigger a channel closure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to know if other implementations than eclair have specificities
</I>&gt;<i> that would make this
</I>&gt;<i> feature particularly hard to implement or undesirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Bastien

</I>&gt;<i> Le mar. 6 oct. 2020 &#224; 18:43, ZmnSCPxj &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">ZmnSCPxj at protonmail.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good morning Antoine, and Bastien,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Instead of relying on reputation, the other alternative is just to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an upfront payment system, where a relay node doesn't have to account for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLC issuer reputation to decide acceptance and can just forward a HTLC as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long it paid enough. More, I think it's better to mitigate jamming with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fees-based system than a web-of-trust one, less burden on network newcomers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let us consider some of the complications here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A newcomer wants to make an outgoing payment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Speculatively, it connects to some existing nodes based on some policy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, since forwarding is upfront, the newcomer fears that the node it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected to might not even bother forwarding the payment, and instead just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail it and claim the upfront fees.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In particular: how would the newcomer offer upfront fees to a node it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not directly channeled with?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to do that, we would have to offer the upfront fees for that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> node, to the node we *are* channeled with, so it can forward this as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * We can give the upfront fee outright to the first hop, and trust that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it forwards, it will also forward the upfront fee for the next hop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * The first hop would then prefer to just fail the HTLC then and there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and steal all the upfront fees.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * After all, the offerrer is a newcomer, and might be the sybil of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hacker that is trying to tie up its liquidity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       The first hop would (1) avoid this risk and (2) earn more upfront
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fees because it does not forward those fees to later hops.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * This is arguably custodial and not your keys not your coins applies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thus, it returns us back to tr\*st anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * We can require that the first hop prove *where* along the route errored.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If it provably failed at a later hop, then the first hop can claim more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as upfront fees, since it will forward the upfront fees to the later hop as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * This has to be enforcable onchain in case the channel gets dropped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> onchain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Is there a proposal SCRIPT which can enforce this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * If not enforcable onchain, then there may be onchain shenanigans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible and thus this solution might introduce an attack vector even as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixes another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * On the other hand, sub-satoshi amounts are not enforcable onchain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too, and nobody cares, so...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, a web-of-tr\*st might not be *that* bad.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One can say that &quot;tr\*st is risk&quot;, and consider that the size and age of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a channel to a peer represents your tr\*st that that peer will behave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctly for fast and timely resolution of payments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And anyone can look at the blockchain and the network gossip to get an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea of who is generally considered tr\*stworthy, and since that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information is backed by Bitcoins locked in channels, this is reasonably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard to fake.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, this risks centralization around existing, long-lived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Sigh*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
