<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I were LOW-REP, I'd still charge an unknown node a hold fee. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would only waive the hold fee for high-reputation nodes. In that case,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the attacker is still paying for the attack. I may be forced to take a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small loss on the difference, but at least the larger part of the pain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is felt by the attacker. The assumption is that this is sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough to deter the attacker from even trying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The LOW-REP node being out of pocket is the clue here: if one party
</I>&gt;<i> loses funds, even a tiny bit, another party gains some funds. In this
</I>&gt;<i> case the HIGH-REP node collaborating with the ATTACKER can extract some
</I>&gt;<i> funds from the intermediate node, allowing them to dime their way to all
</I>&gt;<i> of LOW-REP's funds. If an attack results in even a tiny loss for an
</I>&gt;<i> intermediary and can be repeated, the intermediary's funds can be
</I>&gt;<i> syphoned by an attacker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The assumption is that HIGH-REP nodes won't do this :) LOW-REP will see all
those failed payments and small losses and start to realize that something
strange is happening. I know the proposal isn't fully trustless, but I
think it can work in practice.


&gt;<i> Another attack that is a spin on ZmnSCPxj's waiting to backpropagate the
</I>&gt;<i> preimage is even worse:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Attacker node `A` charging hold fees receives HTLC from victim `V`
</I>&gt;<i>  - `A` does not forward the HTLC, but starts charging hold fees
</I>&gt;<i>  - Just before the timeout for the HTLC would force us to settle onchain
</I>&gt;<i>    `A` just removes the HTLC without forwarding it or he can try to
</I>&gt;<i>    forward at the last moment, potentially blaming someone else for its
</I>&gt;<i>    failure to complete
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This results in `A` extracting the maximum hold fee from `V`, without
</I>&gt;<i> the downstream hold fees cutting into their profits. By forwarding as
</I>&gt;<i> late as possible `A` can cause a downstream failure and look innocent,
</I>&gt;<i> and the overall payment has the worst possible outcome: we waited an
</I>&gt;<i> eternity for what turns out to be a failed attempt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The idea is that an attacker node is untrusted and won't be able to charge
hold fees.
