</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This results in `A` extracting the maximum hold fee from `V`, without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the downstream hold fees cutting into their profits. By forwarding as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> late as possible `A` can cause a downstream failure and look innocent,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the overall payment has the worst possible outcome: we waited an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eternity for what turns out to be a failed attempt.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is that an attacker node is untrusted and won't be able to charge

</I>
The attacker controls both the sender and the HIGH-REP node. The sender
doesn't need to be trusted, it just initiates a payment that is used to
extract hold fees from a forwarding node. The HIGH-REP node doesn't
lose reputation because from what we can witness externally the payment
failed somewhere downstream. It does require an attacker to have a hold
fee charging HIGH-REP node, yes, but he is not jeopardizing its
reputation by having it fail downstream.

Cheers,
Christian
