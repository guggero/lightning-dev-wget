<PRE>Thanks (again) Antoine and Zman for your answers,

On the other hand, a quick skim of your proposal suggests that it still
&gt;<i> respects the &quot;initiator pays&quot; principle.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, the fundee only pays fees for HTLCs they initiated, which is
</I>&gt;<i> not relevant to the above attack (since in the above attack, my node is a
</I>&gt;<i> dead end, you will never send out an HTLC through my channel to rebalance).
</I>&gt;<i> So it should still be acceptable.
</I>

I agree, my proposal would have the same result as today's behavior in that
case.
Unless your throw-away node waited for me to add an HTLC in its channel, in
that case I would pay a
part of the fee (since I'm adding that HTLC). That leans towards the first
of my two proposals,
where the funder always pays the &quot;base&quot; fee and htlc fees are split
depending on who proposed the HTLC.

The channel initiator shouldn't have to pay for channel-closing as it's
&gt;<i> somehow a liquidity allocation decision
</I>

I agree 100%. Especially since mutual closing should be preferred most of
the time.

That said, a channel closing might be triggered due to a security
&gt;<i> mechanism, like a HTLC to timeout onchain. Thus a malicious counterparty
</I>&gt;<i> can easily loop a HTLC forwarding on an honest peer. Then not cancel it
</I>&gt;<i> on-time to force the honest counterparty to pay onchain fees to avoid a
</I>&gt;<i> offered HTLC not being claimed back on time.
</I>

Yes, this is an issue, but the only way to fix it today is to never be the
funder, always be fundee
and I think that creates unhealthy, assymetric incentives.

This is a scenario where the other node will only burn you once; if you
notice that behavior you'll
be forced to pay on-chain fees, but you'll ban this peer. And if he opened
the channel to you, he'll
still be paying the &quot;base&quot; fee. I don't think there's a silver bullet here
where you can completely
avoid being bitten by such malicious nodes, but you can reduce exposure and
ban them after the fact.

Another note on using a minimal relay fee; in a potential future where
on-chain fees are always
high and layer 1 is consistently busy, even that minimal relay fee will be
costly. You'll want your
peer to pay for the HTLCs it's responsible for to split the on-chain fee
more fairly. So I believe
moving (slightly) away from the &quot;funder pays all&quot; model is desirable (or at
least it's worth
exploring seriously in order to have a better reason to dismiss it than
&quot;it's simpler&quot;).

Does that make sense?

Thanks,
Bastien

&gt;<i> Hello Bastien,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm all in for a model where channel transactions are pre-signed with a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable minimal relay fee and the adjustment is done by the closer. The
</I>&gt;<i> channel initiator shouldn't have to pay for channel-closing as it's somehow
</I>&gt;<i> a liquidity allocation decision (&quot;My balance could be better allocated
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere than in this channel&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, a channel closing might be triggered due to a security
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism, like a HTLC to timeout onchain. Thus a malicious counterparty
</I>&gt;<i> can easily loop a HTLC forwarding on an honest peer. Then not cancel it
</I>&gt;<i> on-time to force the honest counterparty to pay onchain fees to avoid a
</I>&gt;<i> offered HTLC not being claimed back on time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AFAICT, this issue is not solved by anchor outputs. A way to decentivize
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of behavior from a malicious counterparty is an upfront payment
</I>&gt;<i> where the upholding HTLC fee * HTLC block-buffer-before-onchain is higher
</I>&gt;<i> than the cost of going onchain. It should cost higher for the counterparty
</I>&gt;<i> to withhold a HTLC than paying onchain-fees to close the channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or can you think about another mitigation for the issue raised above ?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good morning list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that the &quot;funder pays all the commit tx fees&quot; rule exists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solely for simplicity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which was totally reasonable). I haven't been able to find much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion about this decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the mailing list nor in the spec commits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At first glance, it's true that at the beginning of the channel lifetime,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the funder should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsible for the fee (it's his decision to open a channel after all).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as time goes by and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both peers earn value from this channel, this rule becomes questionable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've discovered since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then that there is some risk associated with having pending HTLCs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (flood-and-loot type of attacks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pinning, channel jamming, etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that *in some cases*, fundees should be paying a portion of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit-tx on-chain fees,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise we may end up with a web-of-trust network where channels would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only exist between peers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that trust each other, which is quite limiting (I'm hoping we can do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Routing nodes may be at risk when they *receive* HTLCs. All the attacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that steal funds come from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fact that a routing node has paid downstream but cannot claim the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upstream HTLCs (correct me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if that's incorrect). Thus I'd like nodes to pay for the on-chain fees of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the HTLCs they offer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while they're pending in the commit-tx, regardless of whether they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funder or fundee.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The simplest way to do this would be to deduce the HTLC cost (172 *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feerate) from the offerer's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main output (instead of the funder's main output, while keeping the base
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit tx weight paid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the funder).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A more extreme proposal would be to tie the *total* commit-tx fee to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel usage:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * if there are no pending HTLCs, the funder pays all the fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * if there are pending HTLCs, each node pays a proportion of the fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proportional to the number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLCs they offered. If Alice offered 1 HTLC and Bob offered 3 HTLCs, Bob
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pays 75% of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit-tx fee and Alice pays 25%. When the HTLCs settle, the fee is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redistributed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This model uses the on-chain fee as collateral for usage of the channel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If Alice wants to forward
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLCs through this channel (because she has something to gain - routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fees), she should be taking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on some of the associated risk, not Bob. Bob will be taking the same risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downstream if he chooses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to forward.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe it also forces the fundee to care about on-chain feerates,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is a healthy incentive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may create a feedback loop between on-chain feerates and routing fees,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I believe is also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a good long-term thing (but it's hard to predict as there may be negative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side-effects as well).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you all think? Is this a terrible idea? Is it okay-ish, but not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worth the additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity? Is it an amazing idea worth a lightning nobel? Please don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take any of my claims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for granted and challenge them, there may be negative side-effects I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely missing, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a fragile game of incentives...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Side-note: don't forget to take into account that the fees for HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions (second-level txs)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are always paid by the party that broadcasts them (which makes sense). I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still think this is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough and can even be abused by fundees in some setups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bastien
