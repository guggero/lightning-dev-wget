<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea is that the available prepaid hold fee balance is enough to
</I>&gt;<i> cover the worst case hold fee. Otherwise the forward won't happen. The main
</I>&gt;<i> difference with option B is that you pay a sum upfront which can be used to
</I>&gt;<i> cover multiple forwards. And that this payment is a separate Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> payment, not integrated with the add/fail/settle flow. I prefer option B,
</I>&gt;<i> but implementation effort is also a consideration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the above is not done (i.e. if I only prepay Joost but not Rusty) then
</I>&gt;<i> it seems to me that the below remote attack is possible:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Indeed, the above isn't done. Z only prepays Joost, not rusty.


&gt;<i> * I convince Rene to make a channel to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You may succeed, but Rene is probably not going to pay you a hold fee
because you're untrusted.


&gt;<i> * I connect to Joost.
</I>&gt;<i> * I prepay to Joost.
</I>&gt;<i> * I forward Me-&gt;Joost-&gt;Rusty-&gt;Rene-&gt;me.
</I>&gt;<i>   * I am exploiting the pre-existing tr\*st that Rusty has to Joost, and
</I>&gt;<i> the tr\*st that Rene has to Rusty.
</I>&gt;<i> * When the HTLC reaches me, I dicker around and wait until it is about to
</I>&gt;<i> time out before ultimately failing.
</I>&gt;<i> * Rusty loses tr\*st in Joost, and Rene loses tr\*st in Rusty.
</I>

But most importantly: you will have paid hold fees to Joost for the long
lock time of the htlc. This should keep you from even trying this attack.

Thinking a little more deeply: it is in principle possible to give a
&gt;<i> financial value to an amount of msat being locked for an amount of time.
</I>&gt;<i> For instance the C-Lightning `getroute` has a `riskfactor` argument which
</I>&gt;<i> is used in this conversion.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, by being locked in an HTLC and later failing, then the
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding node loses the expected return on investment if instead the
</I>&gt;<i> amount were locked in an HTLC that later succeeds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, the cost on a forwarding node is based on the actual amount of time
</I>&gt;<i> that its outgoing HTLC is locked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is indeed the proposal, to give financial value to the sats and the
htlc slot being locked for an amount of time.


&gt;<i> When we consider multi-hop payments, then we should consider that the
</I>&gt;<i> initiator of the multi-hop payment is asking multiple nodes to put their
</I>&gt;<i> funds at risk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, the initiator of a multi-hop payment should, in principle, prepay
</I>&gt;<i> for *all* the risk of *all* the hops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we do not enforce this, then an initiator of a multi-hop payment can
</I>&gt;<i> pay a small amount relative to the risk that *all* the hops are taking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I understand that, but I think it might be a large enough shift in the
incentives of the attacker.


&gt;<i> Secondarily, we currently assume that forwarding nodes will, upon having
</I>&gt;<i> their outgoing HTLC claimed, seek to claim the incoming HTLC as quickly as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i> This is because the incoming HTLC would be locked and unuseable until they
</I>&gt;<i> claim their incoming HTLC, and the liquidity would not be usable for
</I>&gt;<i> earning more fees until the incoming HTLC is claimed and put into its pool
</I>&gt;<i> of liquidity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>However, if we make anything that is based on the time that a forwarding
&gt;<i> node claims its incoming HTLC, then this may incentivize the forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> node to delay claiming the incoming HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that is the trust part again.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; B. Tightly integrated with the htlc add/fail/settle messages. When
</I>&gt;<i> an htlc is added, the maximum cost (based on maximum lock time) for holding
</I>&gt;<i> is deducted from the sender's channel balance. When the htlc settles, a
</I>&gt;<i> refund is given based on the actual lock time. An additional
</I>&gt;<i> `update_fee`-like message is added for peers to update their hold fee
</I>&gt;<i> parameters (fee_base and fee_rate).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If I am a forwarding node, and I receive the preimage from the
</I>&gt;<i> outgoing HTLC, can I deliberately defer claiming the incoming HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> (pretending that the outgoing HTLC was taking longer than it actually took)
</I>&gt;<i> in order to reduce the amount I have to refund?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes you can. That is the trust part, your peer trusts you not to do
</I>&gt;<i> this. If they don't trust you, they won't forward to you if you charge a
</I>&gt;<i> (high) hold fee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens if I charge a tiny hold feerate in msats/second, but end up
</I>&gt;<i> locking the funds for a week?
</I>&gt;<i> How does my peer know that even though I charge a tiny hold fee, I will
</I>&gt;<i> hold their funds hostage for a week?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is the trust part also.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; In both cases the sender needs to trust its peer to not steal the
</I>&gt;<i> payment and/or artificially delay the forwarding to inflate the hold fee. I
</I>&gt;<i> think that is acceptable given that there is a trust relation between peers
</I>&gt;<i> already anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I am wary of *adding* trust.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You might trust someone to keep an eye on your snacks while you go
</I>&gt;<i> refill your drink, but not to keep an eye on your hardware wallet when you
</I>&gt;<i> do the same.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Since consuming snacks and drinks and hardware wallets are human
</I>&gt;<i> activities, this should show that I am in fact a human.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I am arguing that there is trust already between peers. Quite
</I>&gt;<i> considerable trust even in case of high on-chain fee conditions. The added
</I>&gt;<i> risk of being scammed out of these prepay sats may not be significant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, onchain activity is fairly rare in practice, so I am uncertain about
</I>&gt;<i> the relative size of prepays compared to relative fees of onchain activity.
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine payment forwardings to be much more common than onchain
</I>&gt;<i> activity, thus the prepays can add up and be significant compared to fees
</I>&gt;<i> on onchain activity, thus the tr\*st being considered may end up being a
</I>&gt;<i> good fraction of the current tr\*st.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Fair point. If you are continuously overcharged on the hold fees, it may
outweigh the once-in-a-channel-lifetime chain fees. But if all your
payments through a specific node are delayed, it does get suspicious.
