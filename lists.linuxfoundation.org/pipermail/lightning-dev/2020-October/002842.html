<PRE>I totally agree with the simplicity argument, I wanted to raise this
because it's (IMO) an issue
today because of the way we deal with on-chain fees, but it's less
impactful once update_fee is
scoped to some min_relay_fee.

Let's put this aside for now then and we can revisit later if needed.

Thanks for the feedback everyone!

Le lun. 12 oct. 2020 &#224; 20:49, Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">laolu32 at gmail.com</A>&gt; a
&#233;crit :

&gt;<i> &gt; It seems to me that the &quot;funder pays all the commit tx fees&quot; rule exists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solely for simplicity (which was totally reasonable).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this stage, I've learned that simplicity (when doing anything that
</I>&gt;<i> involves multi-party on-chain fee negotiating/verification/enforcement can
</I>&gt;<i> really go a long way). Just think about all the edge cases w.r.t
</I>&gt;<i> _allocating
</I>&gt;<i> enough funds to pay for fees_ we've discovered over the past few years in
</I>&gt;<i> the state machine. I fear adding a more elaborate fee splitting mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> would only blow up the number of obscure edge cases that may lead to a
</I>&gt;<i> channel temporarily or permanently being &quot;borked&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we're going to add a &quot;fairer&quot; way of splitting fees, we'll really need
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> dig down pre-deployment to ensure that we've explored any resulting edge
</I>&gt;<i> cases within our solution space, as we'll only be _adding_ complexity to
</I>&gt;<i> fee
</I>&gt;<i> splitting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, anchor commitments in their &quot;final form&quot; (fixed fee rate on commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, only &quot;emergency&quot; use of update_fee) significantly simplifies
</I>&gt;<i> things as it shifts from &quot;funding pay fees&quot;, to &quot;broadcaster/confirmer pays
</I>&gt;<i> fees&quot;. However, as you note this doesn't fully distribute the worst-case
</I>&gt;<i> cost of needing to go to chain with a &quot;fully loaded&quot; commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> Even with HTLCs, they could only be signed at 1 sat/byte from the funder's
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, once again putting the burden on the broadcaster/confirmer to
</I>&gt;<i> make up the difference.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good morning list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that the &quot;funder pays all the commit tx fees&quot; rule exists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solely for simplicity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which was totally reasonable). I haven't been able to find much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion about this decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the mailing list nor in the spec commits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At first glance, it's true that at the beginning of the channel lifetime,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the funder should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsible for the fee (it's his decision to open a channel after all).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as time goes by and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both peers earn value from this channel, this rule becomes questionable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've discovered since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then that there is some risk associated with having pending HTLCs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (flood-and-loot type of attacks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pinning, channel jamming, etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that *in some cases*, fundees should be paying a portion of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit-tx on-chain fees,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise we may end up with a web-of-trust network where channels would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only exist between peers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that trust each other, which is quite limiting (I'm hoping we can do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Routing nodes may be at risk when they *receive* HTLCs. All the attacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that steal funds come from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fact that a routing node has paid downstream but cannot claim the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upstream HTLCs (correct me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if that's incorrect). Thus I'd like nodes to pay for the on-chain fees of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the HTLCs they offer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while they're pending in the commit-tx, regardless of whether they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funder or fundee.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The simplest way to do this would be to deduce the HTLC cost (172 *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feerate) from the offerer's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main output (instead of the funder's main output, while keeping the base
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit tx weight paid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the funder).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A more extreme proposal would be to tie the *total* commit-tx fee to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel usage:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * if there are no pending HTLCs, the funder pays all the fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * if there are pending HTLCs, each node pays a proportion of the fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proportional to the number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLCs they offered. If Alice offered 1 HTLC and Bob offered 3 HTLCs, Bob
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pays 75% of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commit-tx fee and Alice pays 25%. When the HTLCs settle, the fee is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redistributed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This model uses the on-chain fee as collateral for usage of the channel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If Alice wants to forward
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLCs through this channel (because she has something to gain - routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fees), she should be taking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on some of the associated risk, not Bob. Bob will be taking the same risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downstream if he chooses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to forward.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe it also forces the fundee to care about on-chain feerates,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is a healthy incentive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may create a feedback loop between on-chain feerates and routing fees,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I believe is also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a good long-term thing (but it's hard to predict as there may be negative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side-effects as well).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you all think? Is this a terrible idea? Is it okay-ish, but not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worth the additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity? Is it an amazing idea worth a lightning nobel? Please don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take any of my claims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for granted and challenge them, there may be negative side-effects I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely missing, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a fragile game of incentives...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Side-note: don't forget to take into account that the fees for HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions (second-level txs)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are always paid by the party that broadcasts them (which makes sense). I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still think this is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough and can even be abused by fundees in some setups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bastien
