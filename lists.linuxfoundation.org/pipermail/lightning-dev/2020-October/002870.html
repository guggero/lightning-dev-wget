<PRE>Hi Bastien,

I brought up the question about the amounts because it could be that
&gt;&gt;<i> amounts high enough to thwart attacks are too high for honest users or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain uses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this is a concern for this proposal, unless there's an
</I>&gt;<i> attack vector I missed.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I claim that is that the backwards upfront payment can be made
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat big without any
</I>&gt;<i> negative impact on honest nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that makes sense.


&gt;<i> But what happens if the attacker is also on the other end of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncontrolled spam payment? Not holding the payment, but still collecting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the forward payments?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what I call short-lived `controlled spam`. In that case the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker pays the forward fee at
</I>&gt;<i> the beginning of the route but has it refunded at the end of the route. If
</I>&gt;<i> the attacker doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> want to lose any money, he has to release the HTLC before the grace period
</I>&gt;<i> ends (which is going to
</I>&gt;<i> be short-lived - at least compared to block times). This gives an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity for legitimate payments
</I>&gt;<i> to use the HTLC slots (but it's a race between the attacker and the
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate users).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think indeed that this short-lived controlled spam also needs to be
brought under control. Otherwise it is still easy to jam a channel,
although it would need a continuous process to do it rather than sending a
bunch of 2000-block expiry htlcs. For the short-lived controlled spam there
is still a multiplier possible by making loops in the route. It is a race
with legitimate users, but if the spammer is efficient the probability of a
legitimate payment coming through is low. Similar to DDoS attacks where a
legitimate web request could make it to the server but probably doesn't.


&gt;<i> It's not ideal, because the attacker isn't penalized...the only way I
</I>&gt;<i> think we can penalize this
</I>&gt;<i> kind of attack is if the forward fee decrements at each hop, but in that
</I>&gt;<i> case it needs to be in the
</I>&gt;<i> onion (to avoid probing) and the delta needs to be high enough to actually
</I>&gt;<i> penalize the attacker.
</I>&gt;<i> Time to bikeshed some numbers!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So in your proposal, an htlc that is received by a routing node has the
following properties:
* htlc amount
* forward up-front payment (anti-spam)
* backward up-front payment (anti-hold)
* grace period

The routing node forwards this to the next hop with
* lower htlc amount (to earn routing fees when the htlc settles)
* lower forward up-front payment (to make sure that an attacker at the
other end loses money when failing quickly)
* higher backward up-front payment (to make sure that an attacker at the
other end loses money when holding)
* shorter grace period (so that there is time to fail back and not lose the
backward up-front payment)

On a high level, it seems to me that this can actually work.
