<PRE>Hey everyone,

just for reference when I was new here (and did not understand the
processes well enough) I proposed a similar idea (called LIP) in 2018 c.f.:
<A HREF="../2018-July/001367.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-July/001367.html</A>


I wonder what exactly has changed in the reasoning by roasbeef which I will
repeat here:

*&gt; We already have the equiv of improvement proposals: BOLTs. Historically*

&gt;<i>* new standardization documents are proposed initially as issues or PR's when *
</I>
&gt;<i>* ultimately accepted. Why do we need another repo? *
</I>

As far as I can tell there was always some form of (invisible?) barrier to
participate in the BOLTs but there are also new BOLTs being offered:
* BOLT 12: <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/798">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/798</A>
* BOLT 14: <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/780">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/780</A>
and topics to be included like:
* dual funding
* splicing
* the examples given by Ryan

I don't see how a new repo would reduce that barrier - Actually I think it
would even create more confusion as I for example would not know where
something belongs. That being said I think all the points that are
addressed in Ryan's mail could very well be formalized into BOLTs but maybe
we just need to rethink the current process of the BOLTs to make it more
accessible for new ideas to find their way into the BOLTs? One thing that I
can say from answering lightning-network questions on stackexchange is that
it would certainly help if the BOLTs where referenced  on lightning.network
web page and in the whitepaper as the place to be if one wants to learn
about the Lightning Network

with kind regards Rene

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The recent thread around zero-conf channels [1] provides an opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss how the BOLT process handles features and best practices that arise
</I>&gt;<i> in the wild vs. originating within the process itself. Zero-conf channels
</I>&gt;<i> are one of many LN innovations on the app layer that have struggled to make
</I>&gt;<i> their way into the spec. John Carvalho and Bitrefill launched Turbo
</I>&gt;<i> channels in April 2019 [2], Breez posted their solution to the mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> for feedback in August 2020 [3], and we know at least ACINQ and Muun
</I>&gt;<i> (amongst others) have their own implementations. In an ideal world there
</I>&gt;<i> would be a descriptive design document that the app layer implementers had
</I>&gt;<i> collaborated on over the years that the spec group could then pick up and
</I>&gt;<i> merge into the BOLTs now that the feature is deemed spec-worthy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the last couple of months, we have discussed the idea of adding a
</I>&gt;<i> BIP-style process (bLIPs? SPARKs? [4]) on top of the BOLTs with various
</I>&gt;<i> members of the community, and have received positive feedback from both app
</I>&gt;<i> layer and protocol devs. This would not affect the existing BOLT process at
</I>&gt;<i> all, but simply add a place for app layer best practices to be succinctly
</I>&gt;<i> described and organized, especially those that require coordination. These
</I>&gt;<i> features are being built outside of the BOLT process today anyways, so
</I>&gt;<i> ideally a bLIP process would bring them into the fold instead of leaving
</I>&gt;<i> them buried in old ML posts or not documented at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some potential bLIP ideas that people have mentioned include: each lnurl
</I>&gt;<i> variant, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast
</I>&gt;<i> payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote
</I>&gt;<i> node connection standards, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the community is interested in moving forward, we've started a branch
</I>&gt;<i> [5] describing such a process. It's based on BIP-0002, so not trying to
</I>&gt;<i> reinvent any wheels. It would be great to have developers from various
</I>&gt;<i> implementations and from the broader app layer ecosystem volunteer to be
</I>&gt;<i> listed as editors (basically the same role as in the BIPs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
