<PRE>Hi Lisa,

First of all great work on dual-funding and I appreciate this write up too. A couple thoughts I had.

&gt;<i> Assuming that all the UTXOs in your wallet will, at some point, end up in a lightning channel, all of your UTXOs will be *publicly* associated with your node at some point
</I>
&gt;<i> Given the assumption that all of your node funds will, at some point, be used to open a lightning channel, a single attacker discovering a subset of your UTXOs is simply a 'fast-forward' of what will eventually become public information.
</I>
I think there&#8217;s still enough 50-50 doubt. With careful consideration to coin selection, you can keep that 50-50 across all your channels too. With a determined enough prober, they can get 100% proof of your funds for future channels. That would be what my main concern is, going from doubt to certainty. That said, I think what&#8217;s important here is that the whole world doesn&#8217;t know, unless of course the bad actor publishes to the whole world out of band. But it can&#8217;t be figured out after the fact.

I do think combining a picky acceptor with your idea that you keep using the same UTXO until it gets used is a nice approach. I am not aware of how PoDLE works yet, but I do know with other coinjoining protocols, there&#8217;s a coordinator involved to handle bans, bad actors, etc.

Perhaps eventually we can see a sort of coordinator(s) develop here as well. One that can be used to help facilitate multi openings via dual-funding and/or handle the bad actors that might be probing. For instance, say someone has proof that another node backed out with a specific UTXO they were offering up. They could post that information to a coordinator that keeps track of others as well. Whenever a new dual-funding request comes in, the coordinator can be queried (perhaps for a small fee), to check it&#8217;s DB of bad actors/UTXOs. It would be centralized, but could be distributed to multiple coordinators, or even just your own if you have multiple nodes you&#8217;d like to share that logic between. This wouldn&#8217;t be on the protocol level, just a thought I had that could help solve the problem.

In either case, I should probably look at how PoDLE/JoinMarket solves this at all given like you said, it&#8217;s a problem amongst a way more privacy minded context. Even the fact that dual-funding exists in the world is a net positive alone to help give some doubt to all channel openings from now on.

Regards,
Anthony

</I>&gt;<i> As a refresher, the PR is available here: <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/851.">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/851.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to make a quick summary of some of the biggest objections to
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol. Most of these were made during the course of the 2018 spec
</I>&gt;<i> meeting in Adelaide and while we've done a decent job of architecting around them,
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to make them explicit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there's more to add, please do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Point One
</I>&gt;<i> One: dual-funding (really the collaborative transaction protocol) requires
</I>&gt;<i> you to share your UTXO set with the channel peer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is true, in a 'limited' sense, where 'UTXO set' is actually constricted
</I>&gt;<i> to 'UTXOs you're using for funding transactions'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the face of it, this seems to be quite concerning to folks. Here's a few things
</I>&gt;<i> that I think make this less concerning than it might appear at the outset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, let's consider the current opening case. You (or your channel peer)
</I>&gt;<i> constructs a transaction and shares the TXID and outpoint that the funding
</I>&gt;<i> output can be found at. This transaction is published and mined,
</I>&gt;<i> after the transaction is at sufficient depth a gossip announcement
</I>&gt;<i> is broadcast to the entire network, explaining where the transaction can be found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under the current protocol, it's reasonable\* to conclude that
</I>&gt;<i> every UTXO in the funding transaction belongs to a single party, the opener.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming that all the UTXOs in your wallet will, at some point, end up
</I>&gt;<i> in a lightning channel, all of your UTXOs will be *publicly* associated with
</I>&gt;<i> your node at some point (in the current model). Your UTXO set is only
</I>&gt;<i> private in the present, given a long enough time period (and channel opens)
</I>&gt;<i> they will all be tied to your node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason, it's probably not a great idea to fund wallets using a
</I>&gt;<i> separate wallet that hasn't been coinjoined or otherwise obfuscated. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, I think you can make a fairly decent argument (under the existing UTXO
</I>&gt;<i> model) for not mixing lightning funds with any funds you wish to remain truly
</I>&gt;<i> private/unassociated to an 'entity'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that you're currently telling everyone what UTXOs your node owns
</I>&gt;<i> (or at least has a 50/50 chance of owning..) let's consider the interactive transaction protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming a 2-party dual-funded open, as an outside observer it's much more difficult to tell which
</I>&gt;<i> UTXOs belong to who (though you can probably guess given input amounts and change outputs; maybe a good heuristic for opens is to use whole UTXOs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this on-chain respect, the dual-funding protocol is no worse, and in the best case much
</I>&gt;<i> better for on-chain coin-analysis heuristics than the current protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> \* There are a few clear exceptions where other protocols (such as Pool, iiuc)
</I>&gt;<i> have been developed that make this heuristic bunk as they *also* build a multi-party
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, however afaik all of these other protocols (joinmmarket, pool) still require sharing
</I>&gt;<i> your UTXOs with another (trusted) party, difference is you know in theory where &quot;the Pool
</I>&gt;<i> auctioneer&quot; lives, whereas you don't really know much about &quot;any random node that wants to open
</I>&gt;<i> a channel&quot;. Seems like there might be some room in this space for better information
</I>&gt;<i> about prospective channel peers...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Point Two
</I>&gt;<i> Two: an active prober can use the interactive transaction protocol to
</I>&gt;<i> discover your wallet's entire UTXO set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the assumption that all of your node funds will, at some point,
</I>&gt;<i> be used to open a lightning channel, a single attacker discovering a subset
</I>&gt;<i> of your UTXOs is simply a 'fast-forward' of what will eventually become
</I>&gt;<i> public information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, much smarter minds (e.g. JoinMarket, which suffers from
</I>&gt;<i> a very similar issue in what I would argue an even more privacy-conscious
</I>&gt;<i> context) than mine have employed the PoDLE protocol to make the discovery
</I>&gt;<i> of every UTXO more costly for a potential attacker. This is something
</I>&gt;<i> we can add quite trivially to the protocol, at the cost of grossly increasing
</I>&gt;<i> the gossip traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Worth noting that even without PoDLE you can much slow this type of
</I>&gt;<i> attack by reusing the same UTXO across every open attempt, being choosy
</I>&gt;<i> about which peers you do offer liquidity up to (do they have other established
</I>&gt;<i> channels? what's their uptime?) etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A dedicated attacker could probably figure out your UTXO set, but that's not
</I>&gt;<i> much different from the current system; the only difference is the span of time
</I>&gt;<i> it takes them to figure it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Things We've Done to Counter This:
</I>&gt;<i> I had the pleasure of finally meeting Nadav of SuredBits and DLC fame in Miami
</I>&gt;<i> a few weeks ago. The DLC team has adopted a version of the interactive
</I>&gt;<i> transaction protocol for their own purposes. Nadav pointed out that the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol we landed on for lightning interactive construction transactions
</I>&gt;<i> is *quite* interactive; the DLC version modified it to use batching to
</I>&gt;<i> transmit the input/output sets (the interactive protocol is one-by-one).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The rationale for doing the addition of inputs and outputs in a non-batched
</I>&gt;<i> fashion is that this allows for you to interleave UTXOs from a variety
</I>&gt;<i> of sources, for example multiple channel opens in the same tx. With the current
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, you can initiate a dual-funded open with many peers at the same time,
</I>&gt;<i> each of which may contribute UTXOs and outputs for their own respective
</I>&gt;<i> channel opens or UTXO consolidations etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This gives us the real possibility of doing multiparty coinjoins on lightning.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, this is currently possible with c-lightning *today* using
</I>&gt;<i> the multifundchannel command (h/t to ZmnSCPjx for the original framework
</I>&gt;<i> for multifund opens).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As written, the interactive transaction protocol is exceedingly flexible.
</I>&gt;<i> We traded off succinctness for some plausible deniablity wrt
</I>&gt;<i> any UTXOs you send to any peer -- are they yours or are they
</I>&gt;<i> some third party's? How to tell?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's interesting to point out that &quot;succinctness&quot; in rounds
</I>&gt;<i> of required interaction is typically a *highly* desirable trait for
</I>&gt;<i> any cryptographic protocol. The establishment of a lightning channel relationship,
</I>&gt;<i> however, isn't a cryptographic signature. A lightning channel, by its very
</I>&gt;<i> nature, is typically a highly interactive relationship between two peers.
</I>&gt;<i> Increasing the rounds of messaging required to establish the channel doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> change the overall interactivity profile of a channel's operation, thus
</I>&gt;<i> adding rounds of comms to channel open is generally a no-op in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> performance/uptime requirements of a node's operations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## How important is UTXO privacy on lightning?
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously important. But given that the real transactions happen inside
</I>&gt;<i> of channels, invisibly, and that your public channels really truly
</I>&gt;<i> are public via the gossip protocol the much more important &quot;thing&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> lightning arena isn't your UTXO privacy so much as *not* associating your
</I>&gt;<i> identity with your node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Does Taproot fix this?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not up to date enough on the progress of Taproot scripts, however,
</I>&gt;<i> assuming the current requirement that every routing node is able to independently
</I>&gt;<i> verify the opening output script via the signatures provided
</I>&gt;<i> in the channel_announcement, it seems reasonable that on-chain transactions
</I>&gt;<i> will still be assignable to a node given gossip data. (Purely on-chain analysis
</I>&gt;<i> will be stymied, however.)
</I>&gt;<i> # In Exitus
</I>&gt;<i> There are legitimate concerns regarding sharing UTXOs with other peers
</I>&gt;<i> in the process of opening a channel. The current protocol, as implemented,
</I>&gt;<i> introduces a mechanism for some plausible deniability wrt who those UTXOs
</I>&gt;<i> actually belong to, as well as providing the tools for building multi-party coinjoins as
</I>&gt;<i> opens. Further, with PoDLEs, we can at least achieve a similar level of protection
</I>&gt;<i> as JoinMarket currently enjoys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, regardless of what open mechanism you're using, it's worth reiterating
</I>&gt;<i> that best practice is to not *ever* tie your identity to your lightning node.
</I>&gt;<i> And it may be worth reconsidering what wallet source you're using to fund
</I>&gt;<i> announced channel opens.
</I>
