<PRE>Good morning LL,

&gt;<i> Hi Z,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for getting to the bottom of this. I think we are on the same page except for one clarification:

The user &quot;Bob&quot; is creating and sending the invoices so they can always demand and save the signatures from &quot;Carol the Cashier&quot; that correspond to each payment so the &quot;deletion attack&quot; will be thwarted.
</I>
To be clear, what I meant here with &quot;***all***&quot; was that risk of funds hostage exists if Bob has absolutely no mitigation against this (i.e. makes no copies of signatures for itself).
What you suggest is a mitigation that *does* prevent this &quot;***all***&quot; case (i.e. Bob makes its own copies of signatures, it does not delegate signature storage to Carol the Cashier).

Thus, the model outright assumes that Bob makes *some* mitigation to prevent signature deletion, as without *any* mitigation the model is insecure.

Otherwise I think we are mostly in agreement here.

Another thing I have been mulling over is an older proposal where some Lightning service-provider (who takes on the role of Alice in our description) simply generates the invoice+preimage itself.
Then when Bob comes online, the Lightning service-provider (Alice ---- hmmm A Lightning Service-provider hence &quot;ALS&quot; or &quot;Alice&quot;) simply forwards the payment to Bob at that time.

i.e.

* Bob makes an invoice+preimage for a third party to pay.
* Bob hands over the preimage to Alice.
* Bob goes offline.
* Sender sends to Alice, who has the preimage and can claim it.
* Bob goes online.
* Alice sends the payment.

Note that Alice is trusted to honestly forward the payment to Bob when Bob comes online in this older proposal.

However, in this older proposal, any funds &quot;already&quot; in the Bob-side of the channel are safe --- Alice cannot steal them.
Alice can only steal funds it has not forwarded to Bob yet.

Now, let us return to the detailed FF scheme (with separate Carol the Cashier and Kelly the Keykeeper).

If Carol was operated by Alice, it would have similar security to the above older proposal.

* Carol does not have any Bob privkeys or the entire set of revocation keys, so cannot steal channel funds outright.
* We assume that Bob has mitigations against signature deletion (i.e. Bob has backups of signatures).
* We have already established in previous discussion, Alice+Carol cannot cooperate to steal funds &quot;already&quot; in the channel --- they can only steal funds from payments that Bob has not come online to claim yet.

However, the older proposal has significant advantage:

* It is simpler and can reuse existing code and tests.

Indeed, C-Lightning plus plugins can implement the older proposal today, with fairly small amount of new code (only for the plugin --- no changes to C-Lightning necessary, just add a plugin, thus significantly lower testing burden).
Contrast this with FF, which requires a new state machine and protocol to implement, with greatly increased potential for CVEs.

What FF *does* have as an advantage is that Carol the Cashier can be operated by **Bob** rather than Alice.

For example, Bob can have a single-board computer that runs Carol-software, and the mobile phone of Bob is simply a remote control for the Carol-software.
The advantage here is that the single-board computer, which is 100% online, does *not* have any privkeys.
This is in contrast with current Lightning implementations, where such a &quot;remote control&quot; scheme would need privkeys to be kept on the single-board computer, at risk of exfiltration.
Bob can have a separate Kelly-hardware that it connects to its mobile phone whenever Bob needs to send out money, thus greatly reducing the risk experienced by Bob.
The previous proposal cannot do this as honest resolution of the payment is simply immediately trusted to Alice A Lightning Service-provider.

ZmnSCPxj
