<PRE>&gt;<i> That's a question I hope we'll gather feedback during next Thursday's
</I>transaction relay workshops.

As someone kindly pointed out to me, workshop is happening Tuesday, June
22th. Not Thursday, mistake of mine :/



Le ven. 18 juin 2021 &#224; 18:11, Antoine Riard &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">antoine.riard at gmail.com</A>&gt; a
&#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a big chunk, so if you don't have time browse parts 1 and 2 and share
</I>&gt;<i> your 2 sats on the deployment timeline :p
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This post recalls some unsolved safety holes about Lightning, how
</I>&gt;<i> package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT can solve the first one, how a mempool
</I>&gt;<i> hardening can solve the second one, few considerations on package-relay
</I>&gt;<i> design trade-offs and propose a rough deployment timeline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Lightning Safety Holes : Pre-Signed Feerate and Tx-Pinning (to skip if
</I>&gt;<i> you're a LN dev)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As of today, Lightning is suffering from 2 safety holes w.r.t to
</I>&gt;<i> base-layer interactions, widely discussed among ln devs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first one, the pre-signed feerate issue with future broadcasted
</I>&gt;<i> time-sensitive transactions is laid out clearly in Matt Corallo's &quot;CPFP
</I>&gt;<i> Carve-Out Fee-Prediction Issues in Contracting Applications (eg Lightning)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> [0]. This issue might provoke loss of funds, even in non-adversarial
</I>&gt;<i> settings, i.e a Lightning routing hub not being able to settle backward
</I>&gt;<i> onchain a successful HTLC during occurrences of sudden mempool congestion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As blockspace demand increases with an always growing number of
</I>&gt;<i> onchain/offchain bitcoin users, coupling effects are more likely to happen
</I>&gt;<i> and this pre-signed feerate issue is going to become more urgent to solve
</I>&gt;<i> [1]. For e.g, few percentiles of increases in feerate being overpriced by
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning routing hubs to close &quot;fractional-reserve&quot; backed anchor
</I>&gt;<i> channels, driving mempools congestions, provoking anchor channels
</I>&gt;<i> fee-bumping reserves becoming even more under-provisioned and thus close
</I>&gt;<i> down, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second issue, malicious transaction pinnings, is documented in Bastien
</I>&gt;<i> Teinturier's &quot;Pinning Attacks&quot; [2]. AFAIK, there is a rough consensus among
</I>&gt;<i> devs on the conceptual feasibility of such a class of attacks against a LN
</I>&gt;<i> node, though so far we have not seen them executed in the wild and I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> aware of anyone having realized them in real-world conditions. Note, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a variety of attack scenarios to consider which is function of a wide
</I>&gt;<i> matrix (channel types, LN implementation's `update_fee` policy, LN
</I>&gt;<i> implementation's `cltv_delta` policy, mempool congestion feerate groups,
</I>&gt;<i> routing hubs or end nodes) Demoing against deployed LN implementations with
</I>&gt;<i> default settings has been on my todo for a while, though a priori One
</I>&gt;<i> Scenario To Exploit Them All doesn't fit well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Side-note, as a LN operator, if you're worried about those security risks,
</I>&gt;<i> you can bump your `cltv_delta`/`cltv_expiry_delta` to significantly coarse
</I>&gt;<i> the attacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there is an important point to underscore. Considering the state
</I>&gt;<i> of knowledge we have today, I believe there is no strong interdependency
</I>&gt;<i> between solving pre-signed feerate and tx-pinning with the same mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> from a safety/usability standpoint. Or last such mechanism can be deployed
</I>&gt;<i> by stages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Solving the Pre-Signed Feerate problem : Package-Relay or
</I>&gt;<i> SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Lightning, either package-relay or SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT should be able
</I>&gt;<i> to solve the pre-signed feerate issue [3]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the interesting points recalled during the first transaction relay
</I>&gt;<i> workshops was that L2s making unbounded security assumptions on
</I>&gt;<i> non-normative tx-relay/mempool acceptance rules sounds a wrong direction
</I>&gt;<i> for the Bitcoin ecosystem long-term, and more prone to subtle bugs/safety
</I>&gt;<i> risks across the ecosystem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did express the contrary, public opinion a while back [4]. That said, I
</I>&gt;<i> start to agree it's wiser ecosystem-wise to keep those non-normatives rules
</I>&gt;<i> as only a groundwork for weaker assumptions than consensus ones. Though it
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice for long-term L2s stability to consider them with more care
</I>&gt;<i> than today in our base-layer protocol development process [4]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On this rational, I now share the opinion it's better long-term to solve
</I>&gt;<i> the pre-signed feerate problem with a consensus change such as
</I>&gt;<i> SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT rather than having too much off-chain coins relying on
</I>&gt;<i> the weaker assumptions offered by bitcoin core's tx-relay/mempool
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance rules, and far harder to replicate and disseminate across the
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT is Things Done Right(tm), should we discard
</I>&gt;<i> package-relay ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly, in the worst-case scenario we might never reach consensus again
</I>&gt;<i> across the ecosystem and Taproot is the last softfork. Ever :/ *sad violons
</I>&gt;<i> and tissues jingle*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With this dilemma in mind, it might be wise for the LN/L2 ecosystems to
</I>&gt;<i> have a fall-back plan to solve their safety/usability issues and
</I>&gt;<i> package-relay sounds a reasonable, temporary &quot;patch&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if package-relay requires serious engineering effort in Bitcoin Core
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid introducing new DoSes, swallowing well the complexity increase in
</I>&gt;<i> critical code paths such as the mempool/p2p stack and a gentle API design
</I>&gt;<i> for our friends the L2 devs, I believe it's worthy the engineering
</I>&gt;<i> resources cost. From-my-completely-biased-LN-dev viewpoint :p
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the best-case scenario, we'll activate SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and better
</I>&gt;<i> fee-bumping primitives softforks [5] slowly strip off the &quot;L2 fee-bumping
</I>&gt;<i> primitive&quot; semantic from &quot;package-relay&quot;, friendly nudge the L2 ecosystem
</I>&gt;<i> to seat their fee-bumping on safer, consensus assumptions and maybe keep
</I>&gt;<i> the p2p packages to improve on the malicious mempool-partitions-side or as
</I>&gt;<i> a replacement of our orphan logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Solving Tx-Pinnings : Hardening the Mempool against Tx-Relay Jammings
</I>&gt;<i> attacks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current Mempool anti-DoS rules have been mostly designed at a time where
</I>&gt;<i> the shared-utxo model with competing time-sensitive transactions was still
</I>&gt;<i> an idea on the whiteboard. The last few years have revealed those anti-DoS
</I>&gt;<i> rules as a source of security vulnerabilities for Lightning and a research
</I>&gt;<i> concern for L2s still in the early-phase of deployment [6].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond real-world pinning exercises against production software as a
</I>&gt;<i> complement of the current pinning attacks research, it would be better to
</I>&gt;<i> agree on a common L2 attacker model before to modify widely-relied subset
</I>&gt;<i> of the mempool, such as the replace-by-fee logic or the in-mempool package
</I>&gt;<i> limits [7]. One risk of uncareful changes in this area would be to solve a
</I>&gt;<i> pinning vector for a L2-alice but introduce a new vuln for a L2-bob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the first part of such a revamp could hopefully land somehow
</I>&gt;<i> next year. Though, IMHO, in the years to come, we'll have to do more hard
</I>&gt;<i> reasoning to ensure the mempool supports advanced Bitcoin protocols (e.g
</I>&gt;<i> OP_CTV congestion tree,  CoinPool, interactive cut-through, ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note the opinion I raised above on quality of assumptions on mempool
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, even if we harden it on the base-layer side,  L2s should be
</I>&gt;<i> well-aware the product is shipped with a guarantee limitation :p
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Considerations on Package-Relay Design
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Package relay relies on at least two cleanly separate components (awesome,
</I>&gt;<i> if we schedule to deprecate the higher half in the future!)
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;the higher half&quot; : extension of the mempool logic, with a new
</I>&gt;<i> package-level policy, not strictly intersecting with the tx-level policy
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;the lower half&quot; : at least three different designs, receiver initiated,
</I>&gt;<i> sender-initiated and relay-initiated
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One open design question for the &quot;higher half&quot; is the package-size of the
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance logic, which is ultimately a function of the L2 ecosystem state.
</I>&gt;<i> Do we have deployed or in deployment phase L2 protocols with a need for
</I>&gt;<i> more than 2-stage and if yes what API bounds do they expect ? That's a
</I>&gt;<i> question I hope we'll gather feedback during next Thursday's transaction
</I>&gt;<i> relay workshops. IMO, such package API should come out with a specification
</I>&gt;<i> on which L2-community can be gathered and public consensus established. For
</I>&gt;<i> the same communications reasons towards downstream projects, we have a
</I>&gt;<i> BIP125 standard. And especially in this case the bitcoin core protocol
</I>&gt;<i> development process should carefully listen to the needs of actual L2
</I>&gt;<i> users. Also, a lot of those L2 devs, they don't speak C++ :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One could imagine those mempool standards as &quot;perishable&quot; contracts
</I>&gt;<i> between a base-layer implementation and the upper layers, with ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> the full-node implementation reserving itself the right to deprecate them,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe with a lengthy-warning period ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond that, I believe there is another remaining interdependency between
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the lower half&quot; design and L2s behaviors, namely bandwidth waste in case
</I>&gt;<i> of a high-frequency of package redundancy. Let's say if a package is
</I>&gt;<i> composed of {A, B}, and the package broadcaster fee-bump, triggering the
</I>&gt;<i> transformation to {A, B'}, A bandwidth at first propagation is going to be
</I>&gt;<i> wasted. Note, if we assume a dynamic fee-market, this package rebroadcast
</I>&gt;<i> behavior should be common across the ecosystem. Though ultimately, the
</I>&gt;<i> seriousness of this issue is going to be a function of the number of
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning nodes relying on base-layer tx-relay and the number of fee-bumped
</I>&gt;<i> onchain operations per Lightning node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe it would be great to come up with simulations on this front,
</I>&gt;<i> just to avoid silently nullifying all the tedious, small improvements which
</I>&gt;<i> have been done in the last years to minimize bitcoin core node's bandwidth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another alternative would be to come with a cost-effective
</I>&gt;<i> package-replacement policy, so likely more complexity. But might it not
</I>&gt;<i> make sense to not economically outlaw Lightning nodes with a small fee
</I>&gt;<i> budget ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, there is a consideration to have around anti-DoS measures we'll
</I>&gt;<i> have to deploy for package-relay. Too easy, and that's a security concern
</I>&gt;<i> for the base-layer, too hard, and that's introducing yet-another tx-relay
</I>&gt;<i> jamming vector against L2, this time at the p2p layer (though won't be the
</I>&gt;<i> first time [8]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any-case we should carefully consider the upgradeability of
</I>&gt;<i> package-relay v.0, like if we upgrade some components of it such as package
</I>&gt;<i> format or package-announcement scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So yeah why not early 0.24 ? Maybe a bit too short with all those p2p
</I>&gt;<i> questions to clear up among core devs. Ideally, we would land in the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning/middle of the cycle to have time for beta-testing on the L2-side
</I>&gt;<i> and share feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though ultimately, this question of p2p design belongs to the bitcoin core
</I>&gt;<i> dev process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Deployment timeline
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what I believe as a rough deployment timeline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;package-relay&quot; in bitcoin core, early 0.24 or 0.25: a Core's release
</I>&gt;<i> cycle offered to the LN/L2 ecosystem to integrate/exercise/provide feedback
</I>&gt;<i> on package API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;mempool hardening&quot; in bitcoin core, early 0.26 or 0.27, a Core's
</I>&gt;<i> release cycle offered to the whole Bitcoin ecosystem to adapt their Bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> clients, maybe with a boolean setting to smooth the new policy deployment
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT softfork in the coming year(s), opt-in of any LN/L2
</I>&gt;<i> implementation to migrate its fee-bumping backend on top of it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;optimized/multi-party fee-bumping primitive&quot; softfork (one of tx
</I>&gt;<i> mutation/sigash_iomap/sponsorship proposals) softfork in the coming decade,
</I>&gt;<i> friendly uplift of the L2 ecosystem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Glad to answer any unclarity or uncorrectness of mine :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Antoine,
