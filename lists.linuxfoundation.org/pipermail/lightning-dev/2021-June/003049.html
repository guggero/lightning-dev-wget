<PRE>Hi Z,

I agree with your analysis. This is how I pictured eltoo fast forwards
working as well.

Another interesting thing about this idea is that it could allow a new type
of custodial LN provider where the custodian is only in charge of receiving
payments to the channel but cannot spend them.
With the non-custodial LN phone apps there is this annoying UX where you
have to keep the app open to receive a payment (because the pre-image is on
my phone).
I wouldn't mind letting the provider handle receiving payments on my behalf.
Of course this means they would be able to steal the money in the FF state
but this is a big reduction in risk from a full custodial solution.
In other words, you should be able to get the seamless experience of a
fully custodial wallet while only giving them custody of small amounts of
coins for a short time.

I don't think you need to build up a long chain of HTLC txs for the
Poon-Dryja fast forward in the &quot;desync&quot; approach. Each one just replaces
the other.

Cheers,
