<PRE>This is a nice scheme.

Pedersen commitments + pay to point seems to be the most practical way to
do it but you can generalise this paying for a decommitment idea to any
commitment scheme. For example, you could do this in a payment channel with
hashes if we had something like OP_CAT. e.g HTLC unlocks based on whether
you can provide an r such that H(r || x) == C.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately that zkp already proves that C was generated based on x, so
</I>you get your timestamp for free. Ooops. :(

I haven't studied zkp for circuits in general but I guess the
non-interactive proofs are fiat-shamir transformations of an interactive
protocol. Maybe you could just use the interactive zero knowledge protocol
which doesn't have the side effect of the verifier with a proof they can
give to others.
