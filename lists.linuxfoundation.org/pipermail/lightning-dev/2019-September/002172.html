This sounds like a clever idea. But because timestamping is so scalable I
already run a much less clever service called OpenTimestamps that does
timestamping for free. Basically, it uses giant merkle trees built every second
in a scalable way to amortize the cost of the BTC transactions across the
entire world's timestamps, so there's really no need to charge for them.

Even if, say, every single Android phone in the world timestamped every single
photo taken, all I'd have to do is partner with someone like Cloudflare to run
OpenTimestamps aggregators and it'd still be using just a handful of bitcoin
transactions every day.

Also, note that Andrew Poelstra has a pull-req to add secp256k1 commitments to
OpenTimestamps, which may prove useful to you in implementing the above:

After all, the OpenTimestamps *proof format* doesn't depend on the aggregation
scheme, so if you actually build the above it'd be awesome if it produced
OpenTimestamps proofs!
