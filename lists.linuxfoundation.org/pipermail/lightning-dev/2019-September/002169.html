</I>
If you know x and r, you can generate C and R and a zero knowledge proof
of the relationship between x,C,R that doesn't reveal r (eg, I think
you could do that with bulletproofs). Unfortunately that zkp already
proves that C was generated based on x, so you get your timestamp for
free. Ooops. :(
