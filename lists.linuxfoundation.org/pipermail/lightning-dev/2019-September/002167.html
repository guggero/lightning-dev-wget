Maybe model the timestamping service as having fixed and floating users,
in which case the fixed users pay a subscription fee that covers the costs
and get placed relatively high in the merkle tree, while the floating
users are placed low in the merkle tree and are basically free money?

Your merkle tree might then have 2**N-1 fixed slots, all at height N,
then 2**K floating slots, all at height N+K, but you don't need to charge
the floating slots anything up front, because your fixed costs are all
paid for by subscription income from the fixed slots.

You might still want to charge some up front fee to prevent people
spamming you with things to timestamp that they're never going to pay
for though.

</I>
Nice.

Since it's off chain, you could also provide R and C and a zero knowledge
proof that you know an r such that:

   R = SHA256( r )
   C = SHA256( x || r )

in which case you could do it with lightning as it exists today.

Cheers,
aj
