<PRE>Good morning Rusty,

As it happens, I already proposed a possible use-case for relatively-common `channel_update`: <A HREF="../2019-July/002055.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-July/002055.html</A>
In the final section I mention:

&gt;<i> Suppose that in fact, YAijbOJA thinks that the capacity of the ZmnSCPxj&lt;-&gt;YAijbOJA channel is too high on the YAijbOJA side.
</I>&gt;<i> And similarly, suppose Rene thinks the capacity of the Rene&lt;-&gt;YAijbOJA channel is too high on the Rene side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, both YAijbOJA and Rene would welcome the ZmnSCPxj proposal to rebalance, as it moves the capacities.
</I>&gt;<i> It may be that they are so welcoming of this proposal, that they are willing to waive the fee for the rebalance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I observe that many have already proposed &quot;negative routing fees&quot; in order to support rebalancing of their channels.
</I>&gt;<i> I also observe that routing fees are the cost used in pathfinding algorithms, and most pathfinding algorithms do not behave well with negative costs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it is perfectly fine to use ***zero*** routing fees, I think.
</I>
Briefly: if a channel has too much liquidity on your side, passively rebalance by broadcasting a `channel_update` with 0 routing fees.
This helps JIT-Routing of nearby nodes as it allows cheaper rebalances to support.

Of course, it is still desirable to rate-limit such updates.
So we can do the below policy:

1.  Maintain a &quot;latest broadcast is zero&quot; flag.
2.  If the channel has been &gt;=75% in your favor for more than 10 minutes (or whatever configuration you want), and the &quot;latest broadcast is zero&quot; flag is cleared, set it and broadcast a 0-fee `channel_update` and set your feerate to 0.
3.  If the channel has been &lt;75% in your favor, set your feerate to non-zero, but do not broadcast (meaning &quot;latest broadcast is zero&quot; flag does not change).
4.  If the channel has been &lt;75% in your favor for more than 10 minutes, and the &quot;latest broadcast is zero&quot; flag is set, clear it and broacast your normal `channel_update`.

However this will probably still lead to more than a burst of 4 `channel_update`s per day.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next release of c-lightning will start suppressing gossip
</I>&gt;<i> which comes too fast. I have implemented a simple filter which allows
</I>&gt;<i> each message (node_announcement or channel_update) ONCE PER DAY on
</I>&gt;<i> average, with a burst up to 4 times per day. We will also discard
</I>&gt;<i> identical gossip messages (except timestamp and signature of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If people have a reason to want more frequent updates, please tell me
</I>&gt;<i> now! If this is tolerable, it will avoid some of the more obvious
</I>&gt;<i> scaling issues in future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With 40,000 channels and 10,000 nodes, that caps us at about 90,000
</I>&gt;<i> 12 MB per day. In practice much less.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an aside, we're implementing other gossip reductions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  We'll start using gossip_queries for backfilling, rather than
</I>&gt;<i>     asking three peers for a complete copy if we think we've missed
</I>&gt;<i>     something.[1]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  We will no longer ask for the last 24 hours of gossip on startup.[1]
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  We already suppressed our own duplicate gossip, and only generated
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;disable&quot; updates if we had to return an error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  My current code has us never generating two channel_update or
</I>&gt;<i>     node_announcement less than 300 seconds apart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.  We have a PR to suppress reply gossip: if you send us a msg, we won't
</I>&gt;<i>     return it to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  My current code has us issuing &quot;refresh&quot; updates only once every
</I>&gt;<i>     13 days instead of the current 7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The main motivation is one user who has a rPi on a 4G plan. It's
</I>&gt;<i>     painful for him to restart his node at the moment, but I am determined
</I>&gt;<i>     to make it reasonable!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>     Rusty.
