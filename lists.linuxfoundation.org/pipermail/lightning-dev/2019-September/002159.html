&gt;&gt;<i> Not necessarily. If we have an escape hatch in the scripts that allows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to spend any output attached to the settlement transaction by n-1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants we could reclaim these into a new open right away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would have to be very very carefully designed.
</I>&gt;<i> The entire point of requiring an n-of-n signature is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * By using an n-of-n signatory where *you* are a signer, you are completely immune to Sybil attacks: even if everybody other than *you* in the signatory set is secretly just one entity, this is no different from doing a 2-of-2 bog-standard boring sleepy Zzzzzz Poon-Dryja Lightning Network channel.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Any m-of-n signatory where strictly m &lt; n allows anybody with the ability to run m nodes to outright steal money from you.
</I>&gt;<i>     * As processing power is cheap nowadays, there is no m that can be considered safe.
</I>&gt;<i>       Your alternative is to fall back on proof-of-work, but that just means going onchain, so you might as well just do things onchain.
</I>&gt;<i>   * This is why 2-of-2 channels work so well, it's the minimum useable construction and any multiparty construction, when Sybilled, devolves to a 2-of-2 channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the n-1 participants would have to be very very very carefully limited in what they can do.
</I>&gt;<i> And if the only &quot;right&quot; the n-1 participants can do is to force the nth participant to claim its funds onchain, then that is implementable with a transaction doing just that, which is pre-signed by the nth participant and given to participants 1..n-1.
</I>
Just to be clear, I do *not* want to support uncooperative splice-outs.
This is due to their need to either pre-sign a splice-out of the party
like I explained further down, or it requires encumbering whatever we
build on top in order to do a fast-reopen.

But I do think there is value in exploring what the options are :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Notice that we are negotiating whether or not to apply generic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions to a shared state. This also means that there is no direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationship between the ownership of an output and the ID signing off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The privacy guarantees are identical to Bitcoin on-chain, with the one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caveat that we may identify the proposing participant, but we can defend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against this by mixing as you propose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but if we later combine this with allowing multiilateral kick-out
</I>&gt;<i> of a member that is unresponsive (i.e. we splice out the outputs it
</I>&gt;<i> has at least partial ownership of, and keep only those that are owned
</I>&gt;<i> only by the remaining members), then each member would have to
</I>&gt;<i> honestly claim which UTXOs it is interested in keeping after it is
</I>&gt;<i> kicked out of the membership set, defeating this point entirely.  I
</I>&gt;<i> believe this is roughly what you propose in the next point, and
</I>&gt;<i> roughly what you would want with the &quot;n-1 participants&quot; earlier.
</I>
That is indeed the issue I explained further down:

&gt;<i> It also adds the complexity of having to identify which participant is
</I>&gt;<i> the co-owner of an output, otherwise I can claim ownership of an
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated output and force that to move on-chain by including it in my
</I>&gt;<i> fallback and then becoming unresponsive (added rounds of communication
</I>&gt;<i> can help here, but are cumbersome).
</I>
Claiming ownership would then involve providing a valid input script
(disregarding any timelocks) that could spend the output under some
condition. Others would have to verify this proof-of-ownership before
accepting the node's self-splice-out before accepting it.

&gt;&gt;<i>     It may be a bit much added complexity for a small complexity to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     honest, hopefully this won't be needed too often :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Statement makes no sense, unless you meant to say &quot;It may be a bit
</I>&gt;<i> much complexity for a small benefit&quot; or similar?
</I>
Indeed, that was a weird sentence :-) I did mean that it is a lot of
complexity for very little benefit :-)

Cheers,
Christian
