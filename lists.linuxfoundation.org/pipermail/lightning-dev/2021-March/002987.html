<PRE>Dear Ren&#233;,

ah, it seems I overlooked that sentence. Thanks for clearing this up. I 
agree, filtering based on probability and then weighing based on cost is 
probably very similar to doing it vice versa.

Kind Regards,

Elias

</I>&gt;<i> In the paper we suggest clients sort paths by probability but skip the 
</I>&gt;<i> ones
</I>&gt;<i> that charge fees that are too high for a user, which could be defined 
</I>&gt;<i> in a
</I>&gt;<i> user setting. I should have repeated that when I expressed that 
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly
</I>&gt;<i> with this sentence in my mail:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This means that nodes which provide a lot of liquidity and thus 
</I>&gt;<i> utility
</I>&gt;<i> might be able to charge higher fees (as long as they are small enough 
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> that users are willing to pay them)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that is very similar to your suggestion and of course one 
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> include not only fees but other criteria while filtering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general I think it is reasonable to be aware of the most likely 
</I>&gt;<i> path as
</I>&gt;<i> the inverse probability is the number of expected attempts. This if 
</I>&gt;<i> due to
</I>&gt;<i> failures and updating the knowledge and channel probabilities the 
</I>&gt;<i> remaining
</I>&gt;<i> path probabilities drop below a certain (configurable) value one might 
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> to stop trying or consider a more expensive path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if for example a user was to say I am willing to pay up to 0.5% of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> amount in routing fees but after a few attempts the likeliest path has 
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> a 0.01% chance a client could say something like: &quot;it is very unlikely 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> deliver the payment but if you pay 0.7% fees there is a chance (want 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> try?)&quot; Of course at some point onchain / opening a new channel might 
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper which would contribute to the potential emerging fee market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of filtering paths by fees one could also weight the 
</I>&gt;<i> probabilities
</I>&gt;<i> with the fees. An easy (but maybe not optimal) approach for that would 
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> to multiply the log probabilities (which have to be low for high 
</I>&gt;<i> success)
</I>&gt;<i> with the fees. That being said I think the main important result is 
</I>&gt;<i> that we
</I>&gt;<i> should always be aware of (multi)path probabilities during the trial 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> error phase especially in order to make splitting decisions and to
</I>&gt;<i> determine when to stop trying

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Ren&#233;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thank you for the great work!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One quick question regarding the consequence you mentioned: it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plausible that manipulating the path choices would become harder, if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability of doing so was correlated with the capacity locked in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if paths were only chosen regarding the probability of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> success (and neglecting accruing fees), couldn't high-capacity nodes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absence of competition simply raise their fee levels indefinitely, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they would be chosen regardless? Do you have any ideas how to protect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I imagine that some kind of 'mixed' strategy could be reasonable, in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain paths are pre-filtered based on the probability of payment 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> success,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then the final path is selected along the lines of the currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deployed fee rate/CLTV risk assessment?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kind Regards,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear fellow Lightning Network developers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very pleased to share with you some research progress [0] with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respect to achieving better payment path finding and a better 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reliability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the payment process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TL;DR summary: In payment (multi)path finding use the (multi)paths 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the highest success probability instead of the shortest or cheapest 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (multi)path success probability is the product of channel success
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probabilities. Given current data crawled on the Network the channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> success probability grows with the capacity of the channel and with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amounts that are to be sent (which is both intuitively obvious).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Multi)path success probability thus declines exponentially the more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertain channels are included.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand that the actual payment path finding is not part of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I think my results should be relevant to the list since:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) The payment pathfinding is currently based on trial and error 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which has consequences that have not been studied well in the context 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Lightning Network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) All implementations will use some heuristics in order to achieve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pathfinding.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c) Quick path finding is a crucial for a good user experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> d) The uncertainty of payment paths is frequently quoted as a major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criticism of the Lightning Network (c.f. [1]) and I believe the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methodology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of this paper can be used to address this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main breakthrough is that  a very simple model that puts the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertainty of channel balances at its heart. We belief the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertainty of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel balance values is the main reason why some payments take 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempts and thus take more time.  With the help of probability 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theory we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are able to define the channel success and failure probabilities and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similarly (multi)path success and failure probabilities. Other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Failure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons could also be included to the probability distributions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the help of crawling small samples of the network we observe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probability distributions of the channel balances can be estimated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a uniform distribution (which was a little bit surprising) but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to surprisingly easy formulas.  We are able to quantify the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertainty in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the channels and use negative Bernoulli trials to compute the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of attempts that are necessary to deliver a payment of a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amount from one node to another participant of the network. This can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used to abort the trial and error path finding if the probability 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to low (expected number of attempts too high)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can mathematically show what people already knew (and draw 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conclusions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like the mentioned ones from it):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) smaller amounts have higher success probabilities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) the success probability declines exponentially with the number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertain channels in a (multi)path.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c) depending on the payment pair, amount and splitting strategy it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decided into how many parts a payment should be split to achieve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highest success probability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> d) In particular for small amounts splitting almost never makes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We demonstrate that sorting paths by their descending success 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during the trial and error payment process (instead of currently used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heuristics like fees or route length) and updating the probabilities 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current failures decreases the number of average attempts and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produces a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much faster delivery of payments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Additionally we looked what happened if BOLT14 [2] was implemented or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes otherwise would pro-actively rebalance their channels according 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previous research [3] and realized that the observed prior 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes from uniform to normal. This is great as small payments 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more likely (as one would intuitively assume and as previously 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> showed) Our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results show that probabilisitic path finding on a rebalanced network 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even better (as in fewer failed attempts) which is yet another hint 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BOLT14 might be a good idea. However as mentioned the results can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented even without BOLT14 or without other protocol changes by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One consequence from the paper that is not discussed heavily within 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paper that I find pretty interesting is that if implementations 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> follow the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommendation to use a probabilistic approach they will tend to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> route
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payments along high capacity channels. While the fee based routing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily be gamed by dumping fees it is much harder to provide more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> liquidity. And if done this would actually provide a service to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network. This means that nodes which provide a lot of liquidity and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> utility might be able to charge higher fees (as long as they are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough so that users are willing to pay them) which would probably 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the emergence of a real routing fee market.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One note on the question of MPP: In the last couple weeks I have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborating with Christian Decker. I belief (by using the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methodology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from this paper) to also have a definite solution to the question of:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How to split a payment into k parts and how many funds to allocate to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> path to increase the (multi)path success probability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While this is is not addressed in the attached paper as we still need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run evaluations I can already share that an equal sized split as used 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the paper (and by some implementations) is not preferable as one can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see from this example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Imagine one is to deliver 100 satoshi and has to paths with 1 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel on each path. The first of capacity 101 and  the second of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 51.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously trying to send 100 satoshi along the 101 capacity channel 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is bad.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Similarly splitting 50/50 and sending 50 Satoshi along the 51 satoshi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capacity channel is also bad. Thus a split that allocates for example 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 67
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Satoshi to the 101 capacity and 33 to the 51 satoshi channel seems 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable. Actually 75/25 would probably be the best solution for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting. And no it is only random coincident that a binary splitter 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have arrived at that split eventually (after potential miss trials)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is way more math theory of how to actually solve the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem in the general case and how to find a split and paths that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maximizes the probability of the attempts. I cannot share these 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I am pretty confident that there will be updates on that end very 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soon.
