&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed in the meantime Rusty recently introduced htlc ids in the
</I>&gt;<i> form of absolute &quot;lnd-like 64 bits unique id&quot; vs the previous relative
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;order-I-added-them-in&quot; id. I like it better and I think this is
</I>&gt;<i> closely related to the issue at hand.
</I>
Yes.  I wanted to avoid it (it's YA index to keep, to map these 64 bit
IDs to the HTLC), but we can't: we really need to distinguish two HTLCs
with the same R value.  This is because if we don't allow that, it's
trivial for an attacker to probe us to find out if we've seen an HTLC.

Also, if we switch to keypair-based contracts, it's one less change to
make.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is used so we know what the other side has received when they send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an &quot;update_commit&quot; message, and so we know where to restart the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>conversation after reconnect (&quot;authenticate&quot; message).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me those two cases should be handled differently because they do
</I>&gt;<i> not happen at the same level:
</I>&gt;<i> - at the protocol level I would only use the htlc id. It is currently
</I>&gt;<i> already used in add/fulfill/fail, so it would make sense to have it in
</I>&gt;<i> the update_commit msg as well, instead of relying on the acknowledge
</I>&gt;<i> field
</I>
You can't use this for (as Fabrice pointed out) because there are
multiple HTLCs you may be acknowledging, and you may be acknowledging
their removal.  Also, you may be acking a fee change.  In future this
may be changes to the anchor, as well.

So it really is simplest as &quot;number of messages I've processed&quot;.

&gt;<i> - at the transport level (including the reconnect scenario) I would
</I>&gt;<i> rely on the acknowledge field to know which messages should be
</I>&gt;<i> replayed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it is kind of redundant, and probably less optimal, but it does
</I>&gt;<i> separate clearly the transport from the protocol and testing might be
</I>&gt;<i> easier.
</I>
They're actually closely tied.  Every time you send an 'ack' (that's in
an update_commit or update_revocation), you *must* have committed state
to persistent storage.  This matches nicely ie. you want to make sure
you remember if you've ever sent a revocation preimage, and you must
remember transactions you've signed.

&gt;<i> Also @lnd guys: what's the thing with odd/even htlc ids? Is it just so
</I>&gt;<i> that we can use the same keyspace for incoming/outgoing htlcs and
</I>&gt;<i> quickly tell the direction of a given htlc, or is there something
</I>&gt;<i> else?
</I>
I really like this differentiation to catch bugs.  The latest spec
leaves this open, but my implementation currently uses:

	/* Make it different from other node (to catch bugs!), but a
	 * round number for simple eyeballing. */
	peer-&gt;htlc_id_counter = pseudorand(1ULL &lt;&lt; 32) * 1000;

Cheers,
Rusty.
