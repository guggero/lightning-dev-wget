&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see a few issues with the clearing process as currently described in BOLT #2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There seem to be a contradiction between:
</I>&gt;<i>   &#167;4.1 &quot;A node MUST respond with update_fail_htlc to any HTLC received
</I>&gt;<i> after it sent close_clearing.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and:
</I>&gt;<i>   &#167;3.3 &quot;There are three reasons for removing an HTLC: it has timed
</I>&gt;<i> out, it has failed to route, or the R preimage is supplied.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>   &#167;3.3 &quot;A node MUST check that id corresponds to an HTLC in its
</I>&gt;<i> current commitment transaction.&quot;
</I>
Hi!

        Hmm, 4.1 should say: &quot;A node must fail to route any HTLC
received after it sent close_clearing&quot;.  Basically, once you announce
you're shutting down the channel, you don't accept any more routes.  You
could still receive them, because the other node might not have received
your &quot;close_clearing&quot; yet.

&gt;<i> In &#167;4.1, the node must decline/remove the still-uncommitted HTLC,
</I>&gt;<i> which is explicitely forbidden by &#167;3.3.
</I>
That was not the intent of 4.1; all responses are delayed until receipt
of `update_commit`.

&gt;<i> AFAICT, in this version of the
</I>&gt;<i> procotol an HTLC can only be accepted, then committed, then removed.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no way to decline an HTLC, the receiver must always accept it
</I>&gt;<i> except when the sender doesn't have the money or there are two many
</I>&gt;<i> pending HTLC, in which case the connection should be failed (&#167;3.2,
</I>&gt;<i> although it is actually not clear for the too-many-htlc case).
</I>
It's the same with a node sending you an HTLC with too short a timeout
or insufficient fee.  There's no harm in you signing the *offer*; you're
just not going to redeem it.

Too-many-htlcs is a protocol violation, OTOH, and fail immediately.

&gt;<i> We could decide to just fail the connection instead of declining the
</I>&gt;<i> htlc, but there is another issue: if the sender of a &quot;close_clearing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> message subsequently receives an update_add_htlc, there is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> tell if the other party had received the close_clearing prior to
</I>&gt;<i> sending the htlc since update_add_htlc message doesn't have an 'ack'
</I>&gt;<i> field.
</I>
Yes, this is why we don't have a &quot;that HTLC will fail&quot; message.  We
*could* add one, but it would be advisory only, and require the
originator to send a &quot;HTLC_UNADD&quot; (?) message.

Since failure should be an unusual case, I considered that a premature
optimization.

&gt;<i> There is potentially the same issue with the signature process: when
</I>&gt;<i> node A sends an update_commit message to B, it is expecting an
</I>&gt;<i> update_revocation rather sooner than later. But what if B just ignores
</I>&gt;<i> the update_commit message and keeps sending new htlcs ? There is no
</I>&gt;<i> way for A to be sure that B indeed received the update_commit, for the
</I>&gt;<i> same reason as above.
</I>
The intent was that B can't get more than one step ahead.  But I didn't
say that explicitly.  Patch below.

B could ignore update_commit.  But to make progess, at some point it has
to send update_commit to A.  Then A sends update_revocation.

Now, B can keep sending more htlcs to A, but it *can't* send another
update_commit, because you're not allowed to send it without receiving
the previous update_revocation.  So it has to ack it at that point.

(My implementation never sends htlcs while waiting for an
update_revocation, but it is explicitly legal, to allow more optimal
pipelining).

Here's the diff, I hope it clarifies.

Thanks!
Rusty.
