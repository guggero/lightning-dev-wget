&gt;<i> Thanks for clarifying how routing data is supposed to work. Still I don't quite understand how one can make an initial payment request. What I mean is say I run a Lightning node on my phone and someone knows my bitcoin-pubkey-style ID only, how can our devices connect for me to provide all the info upon request?  
</I>
The idea was that you provide them with the information, via a QR code
or whatever.

We won't be (in the short term, at least) routing general messages over
the lightning network.

&gt;<i> Or perhaps there could be some deterministic method that, given a user's ID and overall network topology, would determine to what exact node should that exact ID connect? This could at least distribute the load across the network.  
</I>
It has been suggested that we use a DHT for mapping nodeid -&gt; metadata.
That's pretty long term though.

&gt;<i> And then there are DDoS attacks, as far as I understand it could be fairly easy for someone to spam a Lightning device with millions of payment requests. This perhaps could be mitigated with requests rationing via blind signatures but I have no idea how to enforce that on a distributed network.
</I>
Indeed.

Cheers,
Rusty.
