<PRE>Hi
Yeah, you can always refund your channels thorugh other channels.
I don't think however that it would be usually necessary to balance
funds on the channel to be equal.
I always assumed that a typical user would have perhaps one channel
where he receives funds (employer) and others for spending (stores).
In order to refund them, he would simply spend funds thorugh channels
that are more unbalanced in direction where the user is &quot;owned&quot; coins.
And of course, the other way around, employer would be able to pay the
employee throgh channels he has with stores where he owns the money.
In conclusion, I don't think rebalnacing would need to be a sperate
transaction.
This could simply be done automatically when the user sends or receives
his usual transactions.
I am not sure about all the diffuclties regarding routing in LN.
Hopefully all of this can be done safely, reliably and quickly.
Best regards,
Aleksej
