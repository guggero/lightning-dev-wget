<PRE>Thanks for answer ZmnSCPxj,

I think first two options are for those, who want to earn some money for
payments fee. The option that can be interesting for for some business like
coffee is third option. Do you agree with me?

&gt;<i>  3. In all likelihood, some service later will offer deals like &quot;up to
</I>300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC! At least 3 months channel alive!&quot; for new
upcoming businesses.

It seams the best option for new businesses, but what if such new business
would like to have channel with 300mBTC on both side. Let's say this is
ATM. The owner of ATM need to be able to receive and sending funds. Without
possibility of both-side funding channels this is quite hard to establish
such balanced channel. ATM owner needs to send 300 mBTC as on-side
transaction to hub, and then hub could open channel with 600 mBTC capacity
and send back 300mBTC to ATM owner though this new channel. This requires
trust to hub.

I know, LN is in early stage, but I'm very surprised that both sides cannot
fund channel. Maybe this is because at the beginning LN was presented with
such option. The only reason are trust issues that you described before, or
maybe there are also some technical issues to implement such functionality?
Do you predict this will be added to BOLT and implemented in the future?

Best regards,
Cezary

&gt;<i> Good morning Cezary,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lets say I would like to receive ln payments. How can I do this, without
</I>&gt;<i> locking funds on the other side of channel?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Do the Blockstream Store route: do it early enough, and people will
</I>&gt;<i> make channels to you, because, they want to try out Lightning Network
</I>&gt;<i> quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Publish the node and contact details (IP or TOR onion service) and hope
</I>&gt;<i> people are excited enough about your product to open a channel to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. In all likelihood, some service later will offer deals like &quot;up to
</I>&gt;<i> 300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC! At least 3 months channel alive!&quot; for new
</I>&gt;<i> upcoming businesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  Ask a friend to channel to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
