<PRE>I was thinking that, for that use case, a different signed invoice could
be formulated, stating

* several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts

* the obligation of signer to deliver Z if all corresponding payment
keys are shown

* some terms to handle the case where only a part of the payments was
successful, e.g. an obligation to refund


The third item is a bit problematic: in order to distinguish this case
from a complete success, the payee would have to prove *absence* of
successful transactions, which is hard. Absence of successful
transactions can only be declared by the payer, so in order to reliably
settle *without* going to court first, the payer should sign a
declaration stating that certain transactions were canceled and that the
other ones should be refunded. This can be another invoice.


So, the original invoice states:

* several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts

* if all corresponding payment keys are shown: the obligation of &lt;payee&gt;
to deliver Z, UNLESS stated otherwise by an invoice signed by &lt;payer&gt;

-- signed by &lt;payee&gt;


But if a payment partially fails, it can be refunded cooperatively with
an invoice created by payer:

* declares which of the original payments were successful (with payment
keys) and which were not

* replaces the obligation of &lt;payee&gt; to deliver Z with an obligation to
refund the successful transactions

* several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts

* if all corresponding payment keys are shown: cancel the obligation of
&lt;payee&gt; to refund

-- signed by &lt;payer&gt;


Maybe this can be repeated iteratively if necessary; hopefully the
not-yet-settled amount will converge to zero.


Important advantage: this only requires changes to the invoice format,
not to the network protocol.


The point is: in this use case, the court is apparently the final point
of settlement for invoices, just like the blockchain is for the other
channels in the route. IANAL, but I think the &quot;scripting language&quot;
accepted by courts is quite flexible, and you can use that to enforce
atomicity. With the construction described above, you can either refund
cooperatively (and collect evidence that refund has happened), or, if
that fails, go to court to enforce settlement there.

</I>&gt;<i> matching the payment_hash, but the merchant refuses to deliver, claiming
</I>&gt;<i> it didn't get the payment. Now the user can go to a court, present the
</I>&gt;<i> invoice signed by the merchant, and the proof-of-payment, and force the
</I>&gt;<i> merchant to honor its commitment.
