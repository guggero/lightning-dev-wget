While I do agree that a new message with high and low watermarks for a
sync controlled by the recipient is the way to go, I just don't see the
issue with extending the `init` message (and I think it may be useful in
future, which is why I bring it up). The two variable size fields are
length prefixed so we know exactly what their size is, and where they
end, so a new field added to the end can be trivially identified as
such. As pointed out in my first mail, we'd have to make it mandatory
for the recipient to understand the new field, since it cannot be
skipped if the recipient does not, but this still doesn't preclude
adding such a field.

As for the overflow issue you mention, a single features bitfield is
already sufficient to completely overflow the `init` message length,
since it's prefix is 2 bytes, allowing for 65535 bytes for that single
field alone, in a message that only has 65533 bytes of payload left. But
the sender would have to be bonkers to overflow the message and then try
something with the appended field. It'd overflow in the next packet
since we can't even tell the recipient that we have &gt;65535 bytes of
payload, and it'd fail the HMAC check. IMHO the connection would simply
be stopped right there, and the sender just found a very contorted way
of closing the connection :-)

In the good case however the `init` message can look something like
this:

 - [2:gflen]
 - [gflen:globalfeatures]
 - [2:lflen]
 - [lflen:localfeatures]
 - [4:lowwatermark]
 - [4:highwatermark]

Maybe I'm just not seeing it, and if that's the case I apologize :-)

Cheers,
Christian
