&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that there is a potential problem for sellers to accept 
</I>&gt;<i> lightning network. They need someone to open a channel with them that is 
</I>&gt;<i> filled with bitcoins so that they can start receiving bitcoins from 
</I>&gt;<i> other LN users. But what if a buyer can simultaneously open a channel 
</I>&gt;<i> and pay the seller? In order to do that they need to know the IP address 
</I>&gt;<i> of the seller and how much bitcoins they need to pay, so that they can 
</I>&gt;<i> push the appropriate amount of bitcoins to the seller side, satisfying 
</I>&gt;<i> the seller's transaction. But currently we opened a channel using the 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">pubkey at ip</A> format, which doesn't have amount information, and then we pay 
</I>&gt;<i> them using lntb... format, which doesn't have IP address information.
</I>
The DNS seeds have this information if you are bootstrapping, or you can
connect to any other node and get information on the network as a whole.

Connecting to the first recipient is one strategy, but not clearly the
best if they're not reasonably connected: if you know the topology you
can make a more informed decision.

It's not a bad idea to add an 'a' field, but I'd rather hold off, as
it *is* something of a layering violation.

Cheers,
Rusty.
