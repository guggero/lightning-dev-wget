<PRE>&gt;<i> I am a bit concerned with the privacy implications of having either a
</I>signed
&gt;<i> invoice
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> In particular, I am concerned that it might provide cryptographic evidence
</I>&gt;<i> to the buyer that a certain seller performed the transaction, and/or
</I>&gt;<i> evidence to the seller that a certain buyer performed the transaction.
</I>
It's 100% opt-in. If either party doesn't wish to allow any sort of
proof-of-payment, or service, or whatever, then they don't need to. In this
case the sender would just obtain the payment parameters (skipping BOLT11 or
w/e other follow ups in the feature), and make a &quot;raw&quot; payment. Without
interaction from the sender, there are various classes of spontaneous
payments available as well.

&gt;<i>From the PoV of the network (or participants in the payment path), it's
</I>indistinguishable. Only the end points need to decide if their use case is
one that both opt into for a proof of payment scheme.

&gt;<i> Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The proof-of-payment here is a red herring, I think.  If we remove the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; destination awareness, the privacy issues seem greatly reduced.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Red herring = &quot;something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or
</I>&gt;<i> important issue&quot;[1]? Do you mean the proof-of-payment is irrelevant for
</I>&gt;<i> the privacy issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to define proof-of-payment, in the typical use case of payment in
</I>&gt;<i> exchange of goods, I'd say that a proof of payment is a piece of data,
</I>&gt;<i> known to the payee, that allows the payee to prove that
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;[&lt;amount&gt; was paid to &lt;payee&gt;, and in exchange] &lt;payee&gt; agreed to
</I>&gt;<i> transfer ownership of &lt;goods&gt; to &lt;payer&gt;&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> For services, it would be
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;[&lt;amount&gt; was paid to &lt;payee&gt;, and in exchange] &lt;payee&gt; agreed to
</I>&gt;<i> provide &lt;services&gt; to &lt;payer&gt;&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Proof-of-payment must be available to payer, who has the burden of
</I>&gt;<i> proof. By default, ownership of goods is not transferred, and there is
</I>&gt;<i> no obligation to provide services. Absence of proof should point to this
</I>&gt;<i> default. It is in the interest of payer to deviate from this default; if
</I>&gt;<i> he is capable of providing proof, he probably will.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The first part, &quot;&lt;amount&gt; was paid to &lt;payee&gt;, and in exchange&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> optional: what I think really matters is the second part. Only in the
</I>&gt;<i> case that &lt;payee&gt; turns out to be incapable of delivering goods or
</I>&gt;<i> services, a dispute resolution party might be interested in the first
</I>&gt;<i> part, to find out what amount of monetary refund would be reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. It is necessary that proof-of-payment proves agreement of &lt;payee&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise, Eve could write &quot;Alice agreed to transfer ownership of
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;goods&gt; to Eve&quot; without consent of Alice.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. It may not be necessary that proof-of-payment itself mentions
</I>&gt;<i> identity of &lt;payee&gt;, but it is necessary that &lt;payee&gt; becomes known to
</I>&gt;<i> the payer: &quot;somebody agreed to transfer ownership of &lt;goods&gt; to &lt;payer&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> does not indicate an obligation of any specific party. Without knowing
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;payee&gt;, it is impossible to verify 3.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. It is necessary that proof-of-payment mentions the specific
</I>&gt;<i> obligation (e.g. delivery of goods/services); otherwise, it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> prove anything useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. It is necessary that proof-of-payment mentions &lt;payer&gt;: otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i> multiple potential payer parties could claim goods/services using copies
</I>&gt;<i> of a single proof-of-payment. Now that I think of it, it is way more
</I>&gt;<i> tricky than this, and I'm not sure that any mention of &lt;payer&gt; solves
</I>&gt;<i> anything. What you'd really want is that a single payment only results
</I>&gt;<i> in a single obligation of &lt;payee&gt;. However, IDs tend to be copyable,
</I>&gt;<i> just like proofs-of-payment. The best you can hope for is
</I>&gt;<i> difficult-to-copy IDs (like government-issued IDs) or very
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenient-to-copy (e.g. private keys of nodes that have significant
</I>&gt;<i> funds). How do you distinguish multiple identical transactions to the
</I>&gt;<i> same payer from the same payer making multiple false claims with the
</I>&gt;<i> same proof-of-payment? Include the payment hash to make it unique? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure we're solving anything here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current invoice protocol[2] meets 1,2(optional part is
</I>&gt;<i> included),3(*),4(*),5(**), and can possibly meet 6(**), although there
</I>&gt;<i> is currently no defined protocol for payee to learn payer's identity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There *are* some privacy issues with this kind of proof-of-payment:
</I>&gt;<i> 3. requires payer to learn &lt;payee&gt;, and requires payee to provide
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic proof of his consent to the transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. requires payee to learn &lt;payer&gt;. Because of its questionable
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness, I guess it's good there is no protocol defined for this.
</I>&gt;<i> However, 6. remains an open issue that does limit usefulness of
</I>&gt;<i> proofs-of-payment. Interestingly, while this knowledge provides
</I>&gt;<i> *evidence* for payer's involvement in the transaction, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic *proof* of payer's involvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CJP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*) the 'n' field is not required, but for routing and for verifying the
</I>&gt;<i> signature, payer currently still needs to know payee's node ID.
</I>&gt;<i> (**) optional: the 'd' and 'h' fields are free-format, and allow for this.
