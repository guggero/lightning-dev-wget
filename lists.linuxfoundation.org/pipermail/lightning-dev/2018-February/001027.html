<PRE>Hi Conner,


I do believe proof of payment is an important feature to have,
especially for the use case of a payer/payee pair that doesn't
completely trust each other, but does have the possibility to go to court.


However, I'm not convinced by what you wrote. I do think a combination
of signed invoice + preimage is a reliable proof of payment. Strictly
speaking, you are right: it is not so much a proof that they payer
*sent* the funds, but it *is* proof that the payee *received* the funds.
This is because the only scenario where it makes sense for the payee to
reveal the preimage is if it can claim a corresponding incoming HTLC
with (at least) the correct amount of funds. Revealing the preimage in
any other scenario would be stupid(*), and no amount of cryptography can
protect against stupidity. So, when it comes to cryptographic proof,
this is about as good as it gets.


Now, about the difference between the payer having sent the funds and
the payee having received the funds: I'd argue that it's the second that
really matters. If the payer can prove that there is *any* kind of
arrangement that ended up with the payee having received the correct
amount of funds, that should count as payment. Now, if none of the
intermediaries has been stupid, this does imply that the payer ends up
on the sending side of the payment, but even if one if the
intermediaries has been stupid, why should the payer and payee care? All
that matters is that an arrangement has been made to let the payee
receive (at least) the correct amount of funds, and that arrangement has
been proven to be successful. I consider that proof of payment.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen some discussions over losing proofs of payment in the AMP
</I>&gt;<i> setting,
</I>&gt;<i> and wanted to address some lingering concerns I have regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> soundness of using the current invoicing system to prove payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, I think we are ascribing too much weight to simply having a
</I>&gt;<i> preimage and BOLT 11 invoice. The structure of non-interactive payments
</I>&gt;<i> definitely poses some interesting challenges in adapting the existing
</I>&gt;<i> invoicing
</I>&gt;<i> scheme. However, I believe there exist stronger and better means of doing
</I>&gt;<i> proofs of&#160;payment,&#160;and would prefer not to tie our hands by assuming
</I>&gt;<i> this is the best way to approach the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, the current signed invoice + preimage is a very weak proof of
</I>&gt;<i> payment.
</I>&gt;<i> It's the hash equivalent to proving you own a public key by publishing the
</I>&gt;<i> secret key. There is an assumption that the only way someone could get
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> preimage is by having made a payment, but this assumption is broken most
</I>&gt;<i> directly by the proving mechanism. Similarly, any intermediary who
</I>&gt;<i> acquires
</I>&gt;<i> an invoice with the appropriate hash could also make this claim since they
</I>&gt;<i> also have the preimage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, I think it's a mistake to conflate
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 1) me being able to present a valid preimage/invoice pair, with
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 2) me having received the correct preimage in response to an onion
</I>&gt;<i> packet
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; that I personally crafted for the receiving node&#160;in&#160;the invoice.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> The main issue is that the proof does not bind a specific sender,
</I>&gt;<i> making statement 1 producible by multiple individuals.&#160;I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> potentially worthwhile to explore proofs of stronger statements, such
</I>&gt;<i> as 2,
</I>&gt;<i> that could utilize the ephemeral keys in the onion&#160;packets,&#160;or even the
</I>&gt;<i> onion as a witness, which is more rigidly coupled to having actually
</I>&gt;<i> completed a payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without any modification to the spec, we can always use something like
</I>&gt;<i> ZKBoo to prove (w/o trusted setup) knowledge of a preimage without
</I>&gt;<i> totally revealing it to the verifier. This isn't perfect, but at least
</I>&gt;<i> gives the
</I>&gt;<i> sender the option to prove the statement without necessarily giving up
</I>&gt;<i> the preimage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TL;DR: I'm not convinced the signed invoice&#160;+ hash is really a good
</I>&gt;<i> yardstick
</I>&gt;<i> by which to measure&#160;provability, and I think doing some research into
</I>&gt;<i> proofs
</I>&gt;<i> of payment on stronger statements would be incredibly valuable. Therefore,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if AMPs really lose this, so much as&#160;force&#160;us to reconsider
</I>&gt;<i> what it actually requires to soundly prove a payment to an external
</I>&gt;<i> verifier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Conner

</I>&gt;<i>     Another idea to consider, is techniques like ZKCP and ZKCSP, which

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;I was thinking that, for that use case, a different signed

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; be formulated, stating
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - the obligation of signer to deliver Z if all corresponding

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; keys are shown
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - some terms to handle the case where only a part of the
</I>&gt;<i>     payments was
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; successful, e.g. an obligation to refund
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;The third item is a bit problematic: in order to distinguish
</I>&gt;<i>     this case
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; from a complete success, the payee would have to prove absence of
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; successful transactions, which is hard. Absence of successful
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; transactions can only be declared by the payer, so in order to
</I>&gt;<i>     reliably
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; settle without going to court first, the payer should sign a
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; declaration stating that certain transactions were canceled and
</I>&gt;<i>     that the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; other ones should be refunded. This can be another invoice.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;So, the original invoice states:
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - if all corresponding payment keys are shown: the obligation
</I>&gt;<i>     of &lt;payee&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; to deliver Z, UNLESS stated otherwise by an invoice signed by
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;payer&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;-- signed by &lt;payee&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;But if a payment partially fails, it can be refunded
</I>&gt;<i>     cooperatively with
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; an invoice created by payer:
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - declares which of the original payments were successful (with
</I>&gt;<i>     payment
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; keys) and which were not
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - replaces the obligation of &lt;payee&gt; to deliver Z with an
</I>&gt;<i>     obligation to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; refund the successful transactions
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - several payment hashes with their corresponding amounts
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; - if all corresponding payment keys are shown: cancel the
</I>&gt;<i>     obligation of
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; &lt;payee&gt; to refund
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;-- signed by &lt;payer&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;Maybe this can be repeated iteratively if necessary; hopefully the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; not-yet-settled amount will converge to zero.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;Important advantage: this only requires changes to the invoice
</I>&gt;<i>     format,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; not to the network protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;The point is: in this use case, the court is apparently the
</I>&gt;<i>     final point
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; of settlement for invoices, just like the blockchain is for the
</I>&gt;<i>     other
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; channels in the route. IANAL, but I think the &quot;scripting language&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; accepted by courts is quite flexible, and you can use that to
</I>&gt;<i>     enforce
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; atomicity. With the construction described above, you can
</I>&gt;<i>     either refund
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; cooperatively (and collect evidence that refund has happened),
</I>&gt;<i>     or, if
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; that fails, go to court to enforce settlement there.
