<PRE>An obvious way to make this compatible with proof-of-payment would be to 
require two hashes to claim the HTLC: the presage from the invoice payment 
hash (as today) + the new hash introduced here. This would give the sender 
a receipt after only one of the HTLCs was claimed. Would require changes to 
the scripts of course.
With Schnorr/EC operations this could probably be made more elegant, as 
mentioned.

 &gt; Hi Y'all,
 &gt;
 &gt; A common question I've seen concerning Lightning is: &quot;I have five $2
 &gt; channels, is it possible for me to *atomically* send $6 to fulfill a
 &gt; payment?&quot;. The answer to this question is &quot;yes&quot;, provided that the 
receiver

This is awesome! I'm kicking myself for not proposing it :)

Unfortunately, your proposal defines a way to make multipath donations,
not multipath payments :(

In other words, you've lost proof of payment, which IMHO is critical.

Fortunately, this can be fairly trivially fixed when we go to scriptless
scripts or other equivalent decorrelation mechanism, when I think this
mechanism becomes extremely powerful.

 &gt; - Potential fee savings for larger payments, contingent on there being a
 &gt; super-linear component to routed fees. It's possible that with
 &gt; modifications to the fee schedule, it's actually *cheaper* to send
 &gt; payments over multiple flows rather than one giant flow.

This is a stretch. I'd stick with the increased reliability/privacy
arguments which are overwhelmingly compelling IMHO.

If I have any important feedback on deeper reading (and after a sccond
coffee), I'll send a separate email.

Thanks!
Rusty.
