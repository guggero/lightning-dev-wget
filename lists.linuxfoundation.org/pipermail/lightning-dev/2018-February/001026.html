</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fabrice and I had a short chat a few days ago and decided that we'll

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tradeoff. With some numbers behind it it may become easier to decide :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe; I think we'd be best off with an IBLT-approach similar to
</I>&gt;<i> Fabrice's proposal.  An IBLT is better than a simple hash, since if your
</I>&gt;<i> results are similar you can just extract the differences, and they're
</I>&gt;<i> easier to maintain.  Even easier if we make the boundaries static rather
</I>&gt;<i> than now-relative.  For node_announce and channel_update you'd probably
</I>&gt;<i> want separate IBLTs (perhaps, though not necessarily, as a separate
</I>&gt;<i> RTT).
</I>
Yes,
&#8203;real filters would be better, but
 the 'bucket hash' idea works (from what I've seen on testnet)
&#8203;for our&#8203;
specific
&#8203;target&#8203;
(nodes which are connected to very small number of peers and go offline
&#8203;
very often)
&#8203;.


&gt;<i> Note that this approach fits really well as a complement to the
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp approach: you'd use this for older pre-timestamp, where you're
</I>&gt;<i> likely to have a similar idea of channels.
</I>
Both approaches maybe needed because they may be solutions to different
problems (nodes which get
&#8203; d
isconnected from
&#8203;
 a small set of peers vs nodes connected  to many peers, which remain
online but not some of their peers)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now, as to the proposal specifics.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I dislike the re-transmission of all old channel_announcement and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> node_announcement messages, just because there's been a recent
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> channel_update.  Simpler to just say 'send anything &gt;=
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> routing_sync_timestamp`.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm afraid we can't really omit the `channel_announcement` since a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `channel_update` that isn't preceded by a `channel_announcement` is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invalid and will be dropped by peers (especially because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `channel_update` doesn't contain the necessary information for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH this is a rare corner case which will eventually be fixed by weekly
</I>&gt;<i> channel_announce retransmission.  In particular, the receiver should
</I>&gt;<i> have already seen the channel_announce, since it preceeded the timestamp
</I>&gt;<i> they asked for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably IRL you'd ask for a timestamp sometime before you were last
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected, say 30 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The perfect is the enemy of the good&quot;.
</I>
This is precisely what I think
&#8203;would
 not work very well with the timestamp approach:
&#8203; &#8203;
when you're missing an 'old' channel announcement, and only have a few
sources for them.
&#8203; &#8203;
It can have a huge impact on terminal nodes which won't be able to find
routes and waiting for a
&#8203; &#8203;
new channel update would take too long.
Yes, using just a few peers mean that you will be limited to the routing
table they will give you, but
&#8203; &#8203;
having  some kind of filter would let nodes connect
&#8203; &#8203;
to other peers just to retrieve
&#8203;them and check how far off they are from the rest of the nework. This
would not possible with a timestamp (you would need to download the entire
routing table again, which is what we're trying to avoid)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Background: c-lightning internally keeps an tree of gossip in the order
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we received them, keeping a 'current' pointer for each peer.  This is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very efficient (though we don't remember if a peer sent us a gossip msg
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> already, so uses twice the bandwidth it could).
</I>
Ok so a peer would receive an announcement it has sent, but woud
immediately dismiss it ?

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can solve that by keeping a filter of the messages we received from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the peer, it's more of an optimization than anything, other than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bandwidth cost, it doesn't hurt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's on the TODO somewhere... we should do this!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But this isn't *quite* the same as timestamp order, so we can't just set
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the 'current' pointer based on the first entry &gt;=
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> `routing_sync_timestamp`; we need to actively filter.  This is still a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simple traverse, however, skipping over any entry less than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> routing_sync_timestamp.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OTOH, if we need to retransmit announcements, when do we stop
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> retransmitting them?  If a new channel_update comes in during this time,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are we still to dump the announcements?  Do we have to remember which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ones we've sent to each peer?
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's more of an implementation detail. In c-lightning we can just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remember the index at which the initial sync started, and send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> announcements along until the index is larger than the initial sync
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> index.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.  It is an implementation detail which is critical to saving
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A more general approach would be to have 2 timestamps, one highwater and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one lowwater mark. Anything inbetween these marks will be forwarded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together with all associated announcements (node / channel), anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newer than that will only forward the update. The two timestamps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach, combined with a new message, would also allow us to send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple `timestamp_routing_sync` messages, e.g., first sync the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hour, then the last day, then the last week, etc. It gives the syncing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> node control over what timewindow to send, inverting the current initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sync.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would fit neatly with the more complicated bucketing approaches:
</I>&gt;<i> you'd use this technique to ask for the entire bucket if the SHA
</I>&gt;<i> mismatched/IBLT failed.
</I>
There is also somehting that would work fairly well today: just exchange
all shortIds that you have.
With the simplest possible implementation (sort and concatenate all 8 bytes
short ids and compress with xz or gz or zip)
it fits in about 8 Kb. And there are lots of easy optimizations
&#8203;(heights are mostly consecutive integers, tx and output index are small...)

&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
