</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Finally catching up.  I prefer the simplicity of the timestamp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism, with a more ambitious mechanism TBA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fabrice and I had a short chat a few days ago and decided that we'll
</I>&gt;<i> simulate both approaches and see what consumes less bandwidth. With
</I>&gt;<i> zombie channels and the chances for missing channels during a weak form
</I>&gt;<i> of synchronization, it's not that clear to us which one has the better
</I>&gt;<i> tradeoff. With some numbers behind it it may become easier to decide :-)
</I>
Maybe; I think we'd be best off with an IBLT-approach similar to
Fabrice's proposal.  An IBLT is better than a simple hash, since if your
results are similar you can just extract the differences, and they're
easier to maintain.  Even easier if we make the boundaries static rather
than now-relative.  For node_announce and channel_update you'd probably
want separate IBLTs (perhaps, though not necessarily, as a separate
RTT).

Note that this approach fits really well as a complement to the
timestamp approach: you'd use this for older pre-timestamp, where you're
likely to have a similar idea of channels.

&gt;&gt;<i> Deployment suggestions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. This should be a feature bit pair.  As usual, even == 'support this or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    disconnect', and odd == 'ok even if you don't understand'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we add the timestamp to the end of the `init` message, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> introducing a new message altogether, we are forced to use the required
</I>&gt;<i> bit, otherwise we just made any future field appended to the `init`
</I>&gt;<i> message unparseable to non-supporting nodes. Let's say we add another
</I>&gt;<i> field to it later, that the peer supports, but it follows the timestamp
</I>&gt;<i> which the peer does not. The peer doesn't know how many bytes to skip
</I>&gt;<i> (if any) for the timestamp bit he doesn't understand, to get to the
</I>&gt;<i> bytes he does know how to parse. I'm slowly getting to like the extra
</I>&gt;<i> message more, since it also allows a number of cute tricks later.
</I>
This, of course, is the nature of all appendings.  You can't understand
feature N+1 without understanding feature N, if they both append to the
same message.

You don't have to *support* feature N, of course.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. This `timestamp_routing_sync`? feature overrides `initial_routing_sync`.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    That lets you decide what old nodes do, using the older
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    `initial_routing_sync` option.  Similarly, a future `fancy_sync` would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    override `timestamp_routing_sync`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you'd set both bits, and if the peer knows `timestamp_routing_sync`
</I>&gt;<i> that then force-sets the `initial_routing_sync`? Sounds ok, if we allow
</I>&gt;<i> optional implementations, even though I'd like to avoid feature
</I>&gt;<i> interactions as much as possible.
</I>
If we don't allow optional implementations we're breaking the spec.  And
we're not going to do that*

[* Yeah, OK, we'll eventually do that.  But we'll do it when we're
   pretty sure that ~0 users would break, because they'd be ancient ]

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. We can append an optional 4 byte `routing_sync_timestamp` field to to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    `init` without issues, since all lengths in there are explicit.  If you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    don't offer the `timestamp_sync` feature, this Must Be Zero (for appending
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    more stuff in future).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That'd still require the peer to know that it has to skip 4 bytes to get
</I>&gt;<i> any future fields, which is why I am convinced that either forcing it to
</I>&gt;<i> be mandatory, or adding a new message is the better way to go, even if
</I>&gt;<i> now everybody implements it correctly.
</I>
This is simply how we upgrade.  See `open_channel` for how this is
already done, for example; in fact, we originally had two different
upgrades (but we broke spec instead) and they used exactly this
technique.

A separate message here is supremely awkward, too.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now, as to the proposal specifics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I dislike the re-transmission of all old channel_announcement and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> node_announcement messages, just because there's been a recent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel_update.  Simpler to just say 'send anything &gt;=
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routing_sync_timestamp`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid we can't really omit the `channel_announcement` since a
</I>&gt;<i> `channel_update` that isn't preceded by a `channel_announcement` is
</I>&gt;<i> invalid and will be dropped by peers (especially because the
</I>&gt;<i> `channel_update` doesn't contain the necessary information for
</I>&gt;<i> validation).
</I>
OTOH this is a rare corner case which will eventually be fixed by weekly
channel_announce retransmission.  In particular, the receiver should
have already seen the channel_announce, since it preceeded the timestamp
they asked for.

Presumably IRL you'd ask for a timestamp sometime before you were last
disconnected, say 30 minutes.

&quot;The perfect is the enemy of the good&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> Background: c-lightning internally keeps an tree of gossip in the order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we received them, keeping a 'current' pointer for each peer.  This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very efficient (though we don't remember if a peer sent us a gossip msg
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already, so uses twice the bandwidth it could).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can solve that by keeping a filter of the messages we received from
</I>&gt;<i> the peer, it's more of an optimization than anything, other than the
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth cost, it doesn't hurt.
</I>
Yes, it's on the TODO somewhere... we should do this!

&gt;&gt;<i> But this isn't *quite* the same as timestamp order, so we can't just set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 'current' pointer based on the first entry &gt;=
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `routing_sync_timestamp`; we need to actively filter.  This is still a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple traverse, however, skipping over any entry less than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routing_sync_timestamp.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OTOH, if we need to retransmit announcements, when do we stop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retransmitting them?  If a new channel_update comes in during this time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are we still to dump the announcements?  Do we have to remember which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones we've sent to each peer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's more of an implementation detail. In c-lightning we can just
</I>&gt;<i> remember the index at which the initial sync started, and send
</I>&gt;<i> announcements along until the index is larger than the initial sync
</I>&gt;<i> index.
</I>
True.  It is an implementation detail which is critical to saving
bandwidth though.

&gt;<i> A more general approach would be to have 2 timestamps, one highwater and
</I>&gt;<i> one lowwater mark. Anything inbetween these marks will be forwarded
</I>&gt;<i> together with all associated announcements (node / channel), anything
</I>&gt;<i> newer than that will only forward the update. The two timestamps
</I>&gt;<i> approach, combined with a new message, would also allow us to send
</I>&gt;<i> multiple `timestamp_routing_sync` messages, e.g., first sync the last
</I>&gt;<i> hour, then the last day, then the last week, etc. It gives the syncing
</I>&gt;<i> node control over what timewindow to send, inverting the current initial
</I>&gt;<i> sync.
</I>
That would fit neatly with the more complicated bucketing approaches:
you'd use this technique to ask for the entire bucket if the SHA
mismatched/IBLT failed.

Cheers,
Rusty.
