Great!  That's a really good idea.  Eventually I'd like to have some
&quot;canned conversations&quot; to go with the BOLTs for testing against.

&gt;<i> Just one thing about the &quot;nocommitwait&quot;, I wonder why you make it
</I>&gt;<i> optional in your test: why would you forbid the sending of two
</I>&gt;<i> successive commits, given that the more permissive approach is
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly well defined?
</I>
Because it's a little simpler if you don't let yourself do multiple
in-flight commits.  You only need one set of outstanding changes, rather
than keeping them for every commit.  This code makes doubly-sure that is
true (it is true in my C implementation).

&gt;<i> PS: what does YA mean?
</I>
Yet Another.  I found a pretty good description on Wikipedia:

  Among programmers, yet another (often abbreviated ya, Ya or YA in the
  initial part of an acronym) is an idiomatic qualifier in the name of a
  computer program, organisation, or event that is confessedly
  unoriginal.

  Stephen C. Johnson is credited with establishing the naming convention
  in the late 1970s when he named his compiler-compiler yacc (Yet
  Another Compiler-Compiler), since he felt there were already numerous
  compiler-compilers in circulation at the time.

Cheers,
Rusty.
