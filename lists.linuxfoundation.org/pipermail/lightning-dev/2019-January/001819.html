<PRE>It isn't mandatory. It can be left blank, none of the existing wallets
require users to input a description when they make an invoice.

</I>&gt;<i> ensuring that recipients generate the correct Bolt11 invoice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having the &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot; fields mandatory creates a UX issue for Bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> services that are performing payouts/withdrawals (in the absence of a
</I>&gt;<i> widely adopted payment protocol).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the design of Bolt11 may have been biased towards
</I>&gt;<i> merchants, because normally merchants, as recipients, decide on what the
</I>&gt;<i> invoice is going to be and the sender doesn't have a choice but to conform
</I>&gt;<i> (since the recipient is the service provider).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But for LN payouts (e.g. withdrawal from an exchange or a poker site), the
</I>&gt;<i> Sender is the services provider, and it is the Sender who will be creating
</I>&gt;<i> (most likely programatically) the terms of the payment. However, this means
</I>&gt;<i> that the Sender must be able to communicate to his end-user exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> type of Bolt11 invoice he wants the user to create. This means, in most
</I>&gt;<i> cases, that the user will have to manually enter some fields in his wallet.
</I>&gt;<i> And if the content doesnt match, there will be a payment failure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is how I picture the ux issues taking place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. User goes on my app to buy Bitcoin with fiat, and opts to be paid
</I>&gt;<i>    out via LN rather than on-chain BTC.
</I>&gt;<i>    2. My app will tell him: &quot;make an invoice with the following:
</I>&gt;<i>    msatoshi, description.
</I>&gt;<i>    3. He will go in his wallet and type msatoshi, description.
</I>&gt;<i>    4. It's likey he won't pay too much attention, make a typo in
</I>&gt;<i>    description, leave it blank, write his own description, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>    5. When my app tries to pay, we of course have to decode his bolt11
</I>&gt;<i>    first.
</I>&gt;<i>    6. We have to have some logic that will compare the &quot;h&quot; or &quot;d&quot; that we
</I>&gt;<i>    instructed him to create and the &quot;h&quot; or &quot;d&quot; that we got from the decoded
</I>&gt;<i>    bolt 11 (which is an extra hassle for devs)
</I>&gt;<i>    7. In the cases there they are not the same, we need to instruct the
</I>&gt;<i>    user to create a new bolt 11 invoice because the one he created was not
</I>&gt;<i>    correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What this ends up doing is create a situation where the service provider
</I>&gt;<i> depends on his user to create a correct invoice before sending him the
</I>&gt;<i> funds, and creates an added (unecessary) requirement for communication, and
</I>&gt;<i> lower payment success rates, and likely higher abandonment rate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question: what is the logic behind making &quot;d&quot; and &quot;h&quot; mandatory? I think
</I>&gt;<i> business logic should be left to Bitcoin businesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can we simply not make &quot;d&quot; or &quot;h&quot; mandatory without breaking anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TL;DR users already have troube entering the correct amount of BTC when
</I>&gt;<i> paying invoices that aren't BIP21, so I am afraid that there will be tons
</I>&gt;<i> of issues with them writing down the correct description.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.s. I'm using c-lightning right now and would like to not have to switch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.s.s. this will likely be fixed with a standardised payment protocol but
</I>&gt;<i> addressing this issue seems a lower hanging fruit.
