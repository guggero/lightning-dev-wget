<PRE>Good morning Joao,

Currently no.
Also, why would you want to violate user privacy in exchange for a service?
You should authorize usage depending on secrets the user knows, not depending on their &quot;identity&quot;.

This is precisely why LN is set up to use zero-knowledge contingent payments.
You release a secret in exchange for money.
Then, you authorize the service (streaming data, discount, etc) if someone is able to present proof that they know that secret.

I admit the current proof-of-payment is limited, especially since the secret is sent to each intermediate node.
However, use of payment points and scalars (instead of hashes and preimages) will eventually be deployed, which would hide the secret being paid for from the intermediate nodes.
In addition, proof of knowledge of a secret is simply a signature algorithm (points are public keys, scalars are secret keys).

&gt;<i>From this point of view, your &quot;user&quot; is simply someone who knows the secret that you released when you were paid for your service.
</I>Physical instances of humanity should be allowed to share a single &quot;user&quot;, or have multiple &quot;users&quot;; you will be paid according to your service anyway.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if there is a way to identify a user across multiple LN requests or even authenticate the user in a single step using a LN wallet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -   A companyadvertising a pay-per-view event could make billboards/posters with LN QR-codes.&#160;By scanning the code on the billboard the user would buy the right to see the event later that night. This would happen in just one step, no need for login, just like a regular LN payment.
</I>&gt;<i> -   A music-streaming company could print QR-codes on posters. By scanning the code the user would imediately get the album on the music-streaming app on his phone.
</I>&gt;<i> -   A user could anonymously get frequent-user discounts or reward points on vending machines or similar services.
</I>&gt;<i> -   An arcade game like this one (<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0KUNbjFZdk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0KUNbjFZdk</A>) could identify the user across multiple plays and different machines and provide the user with high-scores and user performance statistics.
</I>&gt;<i> -   Arcade games could provide multi player gaming keeping user identity, scores, in-game items, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this currently possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> Jo&#227;o Joyce
