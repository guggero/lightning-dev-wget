<PRE>Good morning!

Excellent point. I would like to add that on a UX perspective, I would be a
lot more worried about having a well connected node with well
funded/balanced channels.

You can always refuse to pay a lesser invoice but having to wait for a new
channel might be a deal breaker.

Deducting routing fees is also important in my view.

&gt;<i> Good morning Francis and list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not directly related to the original question, but I would like to bring
</I>&gt;<i> up the issue of routing fees in such custodial cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your original post:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But for LN payouts (e.g. withdrawal from an exchange or a poker site),
</I>&gt;<i> the Sender is the services provider, and it is the Sender who will be
</I>&gt;<i> creating (most likely programatically) the terms of the payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue is: when paying the user-provided invoice, does the Sender in
</I>&gt;<i> this case deduct also the routing fee from the user account or not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One possible attack on a custodial service is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Acquire 1.0BTC in the custodial service (purchase by fiat, or simple
</I>&gt;<i> send via Lightning, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Create 100,000,000 invoices of 1 satoshi each on a node the attacker
</I>&gt;<i> controls.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Have the custodial service pay to the invoices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paying 1-satoshi invoices will tend to lead to fees approximately equal,
</I>&gt;<i> or even greater to, the invoice amount.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is of course trivially fixable by imposing either a withdrawal limit
</I>&gt;<i> (number of invoices that can be paid in a day) or a minimum withdrawal
</I>&gt;<i> amount.
</I>&gt;<i> There is some degradation of service, but reasonable defaults (100
</I>&gt;<i> withdrawal invoices per day) could still be useful for typical usage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternately, the custodial service may deduct the routing fees from the
</I>&gt;<i> account of the user.
</I>&gt;<i> However, this latter solution is also undesirable in general, as routes
</I>&gt;<i> (and thus fees) are controlled and selected by the sender, and in this case
</I>&gt;<i> the user is the receiver, not the sender.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The custodial service can very easily lie about routing fees; even if the
</I>&gt;<i> user demands a report of the route, nodes along the route are allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> change their routing fees at any time, thus the route information is
</I>&gt;<i> potentially stale as soon as it is finalized and reported.
</I>&gt;<i> The custodial service might secretly control particular nodes on the
</I>&gt;<i> network and bias the routefinding algorithm towards those nodes even if
</I>&gt;<i> those nodes charge high fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall, however, such issues are minimal.
</I>&gt;<i> Custodial services cannot be trusted to hold substantial money safely for
</I>&gt;<i> long anyway, so any UX problems with them are largely immaterial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
