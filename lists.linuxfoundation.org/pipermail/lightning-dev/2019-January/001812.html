Excellent point, that's a simpler example of how it could break down.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and &quot;lazy-enable&quot; is what we should go for, in which disables are sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right away, and enables are put on an exponential backoff timeout (after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all what use are flappy nodes for routing?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes there are probably heuristics that would help reducing gossip

</I>&gt;<i> opposite: &quot;eager-enable&quot; and &quot;lazy-disable&quot;, because from a sender's

</I>
That depends on what you are trying to optimize. Your solution keeps
more channels in enabled mode, potentially increasing failures due to
channels being unavailable. I was approaching it from the other side,
since failures are on the critical path in the payment flow, they'd
result in longer delays and many more retries, which I think is annoying
too. It probably depends on the network structure, i.e., if the fanout
from the endpoints is large, missing some channels shouldn't be a
problem, in which case the many failures delaying your payment weighs
more than not finding a route (eager-disable &amp; lazy-enable). If on the
other hand we are really relying on a huge number of flaky connections
then eager-enable &amp; lazy-disable might get lucky and get the payment
through. I'm hoping the network will have the latter structure, because
we'd have really unpredictable behavior anyway.

We'll probably gain more insight once we start probing the network. My
expectation is that today's network is a baseline, whose resiliency and
redundancy will improve over time, hopefully swinging in favor of
trading off the speed gains over bare routability.

Cheers,
Christian
