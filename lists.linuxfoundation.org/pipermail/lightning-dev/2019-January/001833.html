<PRE>Hi Laolu,

Great idea, effectively with a clever (hierarchical) usage of bloom filters
nodes can reduce to the bare minimum the DB lookups. I guess with that
considered it's probably redundant to have an explicit probe flag for the
sender? Not for technical reasons though (the EOB can easily support that -
just need an extra type) but it seems to me that the only benefit can be
already torn away by client-side optimizations and it wouldn't improve much
to have an explicit probe at this point. Cancellable probes is indeed an
attracting idea, if i understood it correctly it is about the sender being
able to send out another different type of probe that would tell the
intermediate nodes that the previous one wasn't  actually a payment -
allowing the network to free resources. I agree that introducing probes
that can be dropped and/or prioritized by intermediate nodes is a privacy
issue and can be abused, it allows them to respond differently thus the
probe result can not be trusted entirely, perhaps a node policy where nodes
would temporary ban a peer that is adding too many unredeemable HTLCs is
enough for the moment.

Cheers, Andrea.
