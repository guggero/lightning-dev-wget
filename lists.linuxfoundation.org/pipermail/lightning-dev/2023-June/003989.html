<PRE>Hi Thomas,

&gt;<i> I believe pre-payment of the mining fee can be combined with 0-conf;
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure why you picture them as opposed? Even with BOLT-12, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see 0-conf going away.
</I>
Sorry if that was unclear, that's not at all what I meant. What I meant
is that if we *stopped* using 0-conf for some reason, the solution I
described wouldn't work anymore and we would have to use a prepayment.

&gt;<i> Would you care to describe whether bundled payments already would
</I>&gt;<i> work with the current specification, or whether they would require
</I>&gt;<i> changes to BOLT-12?
</I>
That would require adding a TLV field to Bolt 12 invoices, or a TLV
field to onion messages. The design space for a prepayment solution
based on Bolt 12 is larger than with Bolt 11: I believe we can come
up with a more satisfying protocol.

&gt;<i> I believe that it will take years *after it is merged*, until BOLT-12
</I>&gt;<i> actually becomes the dominant payment method on Lightning. OTOH, if
</I>&gt;<i> this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, I think it could be deployed much
</I>&gt;<i> faster.
</I>
I'm not sure why you think it would be faster using Bolt 11? It does
require all sender and receiver software to be updated, and implementers
are currently focused on Bolt 12 so I find it less likely that they
will prioritize work on extensions to Bolt 11 (but I could be wrong).

&gt;<i> The goal of my proposal is to level the field of competition between
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning service providers
</I>
I agree that it would be great to have a more satisfying solution than
what currently exists, but this is not a reason to rush it. I think
it's worth trying to build this on top of Bolt 12, where we can
probably do something cleaner since invoices are delivered on-the-fly
and short-lived.

Thanks,
Bastien

&#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hello Dave,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is an interesting idea; it would indeed save space for the prepayment
</I>&gt;<i> hash.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the invoice would still need a feature bit, so that the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> decide to make prepayment optional or required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that for the feature to be optional, we need to subtract the
</I>&gt;<i> prepayment
</I>&gt;<i> amount from the main payment amount. Thus, in your example, Alice would
</I>&gt;<i> expect
</I>&gt;<i> to receive either:
</I>&gt;<i>   (1 BTC, invoice payment_hash)
</I>&gt;<i> or:
</I>&gt;<i>   (1 BTC - minus 10k sats, invoice payment_hash) + (10k sats,
</I>&gt;<i> prepayment_hash via keysend)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cheers
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  - 2. the receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have arrived, before they fulfill the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; main payment does not arrive, they should fail the pre-payment with a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Thomas,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you actually require a BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the prepayment, or would it be acceptable for the prepayment to use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keysend payment with the onion message payload for the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alice wants to receive 1 BTC to hash 0123...cdef with a prepayment of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10k sats, so the 10k sats is sent via keysend with metadata indicating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the receiver shouldn't claim it until they receive the 1 BTC HTLC to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0123...cdef).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, I think then you'd only need BOLT11 invoices to be extended with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an extra_fee_via_keysend field.  That would be significantly smaller and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it also allows encoding the extra_fee_via_keysend field in an existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BOLT11 field like (d) description or the relatively new (m) metadata
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field, which may allow immediate implementation until an updated version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of BOLT11 (or an alternative using offers) becomes widely deployed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
