They will not as-specified, but because BOLT12 offers are reusable you will be able to scan a single 
offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this.

Great to hear that!

Absolutely true.

&gt;<i> OTOH, if

I'm not sure why? Indeed, BOLT-12 has some time to go in terms of getting off the ground floor, as 
it were, but a new BOLT-11 extension has to start from 0 - with zero implementations today and, 
worse, having to convince people to actually care enough to implement it.

At least with BOLT-12 a client that is &quot;swap-aware&quot; you don't have to scan two QR codes or do any 
complicated dance.

&gt;<i> The goal of my proposal is to level the field of competition between
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning service providers, by allowing reverse submarine swap
</I>&gt;<i> payments to come from any wallet (of course, a dedicated client will
</I>&gt;<i> still be needed to verify the redeem script and the invoice, and to
</I>&gt;<i> sweep the funds, as discussed above)
</I>
I admit I still kinda struggle to see the value here - the user has to have a &quot;swap-aware&quot; client 
doing the swap setup and enforcement, but then can have any lightning wallet pay it. So it only 
really makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet they want to use which is distinct from their 
lightning wallet (and their lightning wallet doesn't support splice-out, which presumably most will 
in a year or so). This seems like quite a narrow set of requirements to me.
