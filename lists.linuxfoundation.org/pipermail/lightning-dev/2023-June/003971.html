<PRE>I thought I would respond from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address as well to give a little more validation to my account.


Peter, before you make false statements about the domain, I want to clarify that the domain vistomail.com&#160;hasn't changed hands since I registered it. What you see is a purchase update (added years) on who.is. I thought you might know that as smart as you are. I added years to ownership recently because the domain was set to expire. You always know best though, with your smart ass comments and constant arguments you start on Twitter. I see everything. You have the greatest technology known to man and you argue over everything. Stop arguing and work harder. Even now you just dismiss and you are trying to start an argument and stopped my ability submit posts in bitcoin-dev, bitcoin-core-dev, but now in lightning-dev as of 5 mins ago. I understand and it is obvious the new developers no longer want me around I am totally fine with that. Just to clarify, I also added <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">satoshin at vistomail.com</A>&#160;and <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">contact at vistomail.com</A>&#160;as lightning addresses just so Craig Wright can stop tryin to sue everyone and pretend he is the creator of Bitcoin. (Cobra and Hodlonaut You held your own, nice work) I have many other ways to prove that I am the real Satoshi, but I never cared because I am the real Satoshi. I saw all the messages, everyones. Including yours peter. I added my lightning address to <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com.</A> I was just giving a compliment to the Lightning team. Really nice work. It is a really great thing what you all did and thank you for making me feel so welcomed. Satoshi Nakamoto
