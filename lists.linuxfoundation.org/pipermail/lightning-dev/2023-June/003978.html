</I>
In order to be properly non-custodial, a submarine swap client needs to be
able to unilaterally sweep or timeout an on chain HTLC and also validate all
the swap parameters.

Assuming I understand this web based flow correctly, it still requires
&quot;dedicated logic&quot; on the client side to sweep (reveal the preimage) or
timeout the on chain HTLC.  If one wishes to avoid the awareness of the
subswap itself, then a user would need to manually go to the website in
order to obtain a signed sweep transaction (for a Loop Out like sub-swap, so
off-chain to on-chain).  However, that would still require the wallet to
sign
the HTLC sweep path, once again requiring dedicated logic. A website could
have an option to give a user a signed sweep or refund transaction, but that
can't be created until user goes on chain as something like no_input doesn't
exist today on mainnet. Even then, a website can let the user act first,
then just never give them the necessary signed transaction.

In other words: one always requires dedicated logic in order to fully verify
the swap parameters and also perform an on-chain sweep/timeout, which is a
requirement for a trust minified swap. A user can trust the service to just
send to the given address or pay an invoice for them, but that's not a trust
minimized swap.

&gt;<i> Good morning list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to propose an extension to BOLT-11, where an invoice can
</I>&gt;<i> contain two bundled payments, with distinct preimages and amounts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The use case is for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee
</I>&gt;<i> in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place:
</I>&gt;<i>   - Submarine swaps
</I>&gt;<i>   - JIT channels
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In both cases, the service provider receives a HTLC for which they do not
</I>&gt;<i> have the preimage, have to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine
</I>&gt;<i> swap funding address), and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when
</I>&gt;<i> they claim the payment. Because there is no guarantee that the client will
</I>&gt;<i> actually claim the payment, the service providers need to ask prepayment of
</I>&gt;<i> mining fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of submarine swaps, services that use dedicated client
</I>&gt;<i> software, such as Loop by Lightning Labs, can ask for a prepayment, because
</I>&gt;<i> their software can handle it (this is called &quot;no show penalty&quot; on the Loop
</I>&gt;<i> website). However, competitors who do require a dedicated wallet, not such
</I>&gt;<i> as the Boltz exchange, cannot do that. Their website shows an invoice to
</I>&gt;<i> the user, whose wallet that is agnostic about the swap, and it would be
</I>&gt;<i> unpractical for them to show two invoices to be paid simultaneously. This
</I>&gt;<i> creates a situation where Boltz is vulnerable to DoS attacks, where the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves
</I>&gt;<i> against this mining fee attack need to ask the preimage of the main payment
</I>&gt;<i> before they open the channel. I believe this is what Phoenix does (although
</I>&gt;<i> their pay-to-open service is not open-source, so I cannot really check).
</I>&gt;<i> The issue is that a service that asks for the preimage first becomes
</I>&gt;<i> custodian. From a legal perspective, it does not matter whether they open
</I>&gt;<i> the channel immediately after receiving the preimage, the ordering of
</I>&gt;<i> events makes their service custodian. In Europe, such a service will fall
</I>&gt;<i> within the European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer
</I>&gt;<i> custodian services, such as Electrum, are excluded from that game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to solve that, it would be beneficial to bundle the prepayment
</I>&gt;<i> and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The semantics of bundled payments is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>   - 1. the BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts:
</I>&gt;<i> prepayment and main payment.
</I>&gt;<i>   - 2. the receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have
</I>&gt;<i> arrived, before they fulfill the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main
</I>&gt;<i> payment does not arrive, they should fail the pre-payment with a MPP
</I>&gt;<i> timeout.
</I>&gt;<i>   - 3. once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills
</I>&gt;<i> the HTLCs of the prepayment, and they broadcast their on-chain transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveal the
</I>&gt;<i> preimage of the main payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, nothing in my proposal prevents the service provider from
</I>&gt;<i> stealing the pre-payment, but that is already the case today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this proposal would level the field in terms of competition
</I>&gt;<i> between lightning service providers. Currently, you need to use a dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> client in order to use Loop, and competitors who do not have an established
</I>&gt;<i> user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack.
</I>&gt;<i> I also believe that ACINQ would benefit from this, because it would make it
</I>&gt;<i> possible for them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. My
</I>&gt;<i> understanding is that in its current form, the 'pay-to-open' service used
</I>&gt;<i> by Phoenix will fall into the scope of the European MICA regulation, which
</I>&gt;<i> they should consider as a serious issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I believe that such a change should be implemented in BOLT-11,
</I>&gt;<i> and not using BOLT-12 or onion messages. Indeed, my proposal does not
</I>&gt;<i> require the exchange of new messages. Some of the initial feedback I
</I>&gt;<i> received was that this is a use case for BOLT-12 or OM, but I think that
</I>&gt;<i> this is making things unnecessarily complicated. We should not add new
</I>&gt;<i> messages when things can be done in a non-interactive way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> ThomasV
