<PRE>I think the ship has probably sailed on getting any kind of new interoperable change in to BOLT-11.

We already can't get amount-less BOLT-11 invoices broadly supported, rolling out yet another new 
incompatible version of BOLT-11 and expecting the entire ecosystem to support it doesn't seem all 
that likely.

If we're working towards specifying some &quot;standard&quot; way of doing swaps, (a) I'd be curious to 
understand why the need isn't obviated by splice-out, and (b) why it shouldn't be built on OMs so 
you can do it more privately.

&gt;<i> Good morning list,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to propose an extension to BOLT-11, where an invoice can contain two bundled payments, 
</I>&gt;<i> with distinct preimages and amounts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The use case is for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-custodian exchange to take place:
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;- Submarine swaps
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;- JIT channels
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In both cases, the service provider receives a HTLC for which they do not have the preimage, have to 
</I>&gt;<i> send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address), and wait for the client to 
</I>&gt;<i> reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. Because there is no guarantee that the client will 
</I>&gt;<i> actually claim the payment, the service providers need to ask prepayment of mining fees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of submarine swaps, services that use dedicated client software, such as Loop by 
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning Labs, can ask for a prepayment, because their software can handle it (this is called &quot;no 
</I>&gt;<i> show penalty&quot; on the Loop website). However, competitors who do require a dedicated wallet, not such 
</I>&gt;<i> as the Boltz exchange, cannot do that. Their website shows an invoice to the user, whose wallet that 
</I>&gt;<i> is agnostic about the swap, and it would be unpractical for them to show two invoices to be paid 
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously. This creates a situation where Boltz is vulnerable to DoS attacks, where the 
</I>&gt;<i> attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack 
</I>&gt;<i> need to ask the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. I believe this is what 
</I>&gt;<i> Phoenix does (although their pay-to-open service is not open-source, so I cannot really check). The 
</I>&gt;<i> issue is that a service that asks for the preimage first becomes custodian. From a legal 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, it does not matter whether they open the channel immediately after receiving the 
</I>&gt;<i> preimage, the ordering of events makes their service custodian. In Europe, such a service will fall 
</I>&gt;<i> within the European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> Electrum, are excluded from that game.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to solve that, it would be beneficial to bundle the prepayment and the main payment in the 
</I>&gt;<i> same BOLT-11 invoice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The semantics of bundled payments is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;- 1. the BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;- 2. the receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, before they 
</I>&gt;<i> fulfill the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the 
</I>&gt;<i> pre-payment with a MPP timeout.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;- 3. once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the 
</I>&gt;<i> prepayment, and they broadcast their on-chain transaction. Note that the main payment can still fail 
</I>&gt;<i> if the sender never reveal the preimage of the main payment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, nothing in my proposal prevents the service provider from stealing the pre-payment, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that is already the case today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service 
</I>&gt;<i> providers. Currently, you need to use a dedicated client in order to use Loop, and competitors who 
</I>&gt;<i> do not have an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee 
</I>&gt;<i> attack. I also believe that ACINQ would benefit from this, because it would make it possible for 
</I>&gt;<i> them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. My understanding is that in its current 
</I>&gt;<i> form, the 'pay-to-open' service used by Phoenix will fall into the scope of the European MICA 
</I>&gt;<i> regulation, which they should consider as a serious issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I believe that such a change should be implemented in BOLT-11, and not using BOLT-12 or 
</I>&gt;<i> onion messages. Indeed, my proposal does not require the exchange of new messages. Some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> initial feedback I received was that this is a use case for BOLT-12 or OM, but I think that this is 
</I>&gt;<i> making things unnecessarily complicated. We should not add new messages when things can be done in a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-interactive way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> ThomasV
