<PRE>Hey Ankit,

The lightning network sees the possession of a preimage as a proof of
payment. And I believe everyone agrees that a court should rule in favor of
A forcing E to deliver the good or reimburse A. The reason is that
possession of the preimage matching the signed payment hash from E is a
much stronger evidence of A actually having paid than E claiming to not
have received anything.
This is also due to the fact that guessing the preimage can practically be
considered impossible (though there is a tiny likelihood)

If E breaches the protocol by giving the preimage to C (for free) instead
of claiming the money from D (and thus settling the Htlc) it will be
considered E's problem, that E did not get reimbursed but just gave out the
preimage for free. (actually E's so called &quot;partner in crime&quot; did get
reimbursed). Even if D would testify that E never settled the Htlc one
would wonder why E never settled the incoming htlc as they should only have
created a payment hash for which they know the preimage. Since A can
actually provide one it is again unlikely if E for example claims they just
used a random hash for which they didn't know the preimage because they
wanted to just see if A has enough liquidity.

With kind regards Rene

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They don&#8217;t have a direct payment channel among them. So, they use a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E sends the hash of a secret r to A, A passes on the hash to B, B to C, C

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E discloses the secret to C (a partner in crime with E) and E do not
</I>&gt;<i> respond to D. C gives the secret to B (settling the HTLC between them).
</I>&gt;<i> Then, B gives the secret to A (settling the HTLC between them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A sent (and lost) the money, as E denies receiving the money (and the

</I>&gt;<i> How the lightening network sees this? Out of their control?
