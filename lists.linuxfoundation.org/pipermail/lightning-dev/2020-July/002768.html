<PRE>Hi Z,

&gt;<i> Probably arguably off-topic, but this post triggered me into thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about an insane idea: offchain update from existing Poon-Dryja to newer
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun (&quot;eltoo&quot;) mechanism.
</I>
Ooo, yeh I don't see why this would be possible assuming at that point
no_input has been deployed...

However, switching between commitment types that have distinct commitment
invalidation mechanisms appears to make things a bit more complex. Consider
that since the earlier lifetime of my channel used _revocation_ based
invalidation, I'd need to be able to handle two types of invalid commitment
broadcasts: broadcast of a revoked commitment, and broadcast of a _replaced_
commitment.

As a result, implementations may want to limit the types of transitions to
only a commitment type with the same invalidation mechanism. On the other
hand, I don't think that additional complexity (being able to handle both
types
of contract violations) is insurmountable.

For those that wish to retain a revocation based commitment invalidation
model, they may instead opt to upgrade to something like this [1], which I
consider to be the current best successor to the OG Poon-Dryja revocation
mechanism (has some other tool traits too). The commitment format still
needs a sexy name though....&quot;el tres&quot;? ;)

&gt;<i> We can create an upgrade transaction that is a cut-through of a mutual
</I>&gt;<i> close of the Poon-Dryja, and a funding open of a Decker-Russell-Osuntokun.
</I>
Splicing reborn!

&gt;<i> The channel retains its short-channel-id, which may be useful, since a
</I>&gt;<i> provably-long-lived channel implies both channel participants have high
</I>&gt;<i> reliability (else one or the other would have closed the channel at some
</I>&gt;<i> point), and a pathfinding algorithm may bias towards such long-lived
</I>&gt;<i> channels.
</I>
Indeed, I think some implementations (eclair?) factor in the age of the
channel they're attempting to traverse during path finding.

&gt;<i> Good morning Laolu, and list,

</I>&gt;<i> Probably arguably off-topic, but this post triggered me into thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about an insane idea: offchain update from existing Poon-Dryja to newer
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun (&quot;eltoo&quot;) mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Due to the way `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` will be deployed --- requires a new
</I>&gt;<i> pubkey type and works only inside the Taproot construction --- we cannot
</I>&gt;<i> seamlessly upgrade from a Poon-Dryja channel to a Decker-Russell-Osuntokun.
</I>&gt;<i> The funding outpoint itself has to be changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can create an upgrade transaction that is a cut-through of a mutual
</I>&gt;<i> close of the Poon-Dryja, and a funding open of a Decker-Russell-Osuntokun.
</I>&gt;<i> This transaction spends the funding outpoint of an existing Poon-Dryja
</I>&gt;<i> channel, and creates a Decker-Russell-Osuntokun funding outpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, once such an upgrade transaction has been created and signed by
</I>&gt;<i> both parties (after the necessary initial state is signed in the
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun mechanism), nothing prevents the participants
</I>&gt;<i> from, say, just keeping the upgrade transaction offchain as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The participants can simply, after the upgrade transaction has been
</I>&gt;<i> signed, revoke the latest Poon-Dryja state (which has been copied into the
</I>&gt;<i> initial Decker-Russell-Osuntokun state).
</I>&gt;<i> Then they can keep the upgrade transaction offchain, and treat the funding
</I>&gt;<i> outpoint of the upgrade transaction as the &quot;internal funding outpoint&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> future Decker-Russell-Osuntokun updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, of course, since the onchain funding outpoint remains a Poon-Dryja,
</I>&gt;<i> it can still be spent using a revoked state.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, we do not gain anything much, since the entire HTLC history of the
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja channel needs to be retained as protection against theft
</I>&gt;<i> attempts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Future HTLCs in the Decker-Russell-Osuntokun domain need not be recorded
</I>&gt;<i> permanently, thus at least bounding the information liability of the
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded channel.
</I>&gt;<i> * The channel retains its short-channel-id, which may be useful, since a
</I>&gt;<i> provably-long-lived channel implies both channel participants have high
</I>&gt;<i> reliability (else one or the other would have closed the channel at some
</I>&gt;<i> point), and a pathfinding algorithm may bias towards such long-lived
</I>&gt;<i> channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of note, is that if the channel is later mutually closed, the upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, being offchain, never need appear onchain, so this potentially
</I>&gt;<i> saves blockchain space.
</I>&gt;<i>
