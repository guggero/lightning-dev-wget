<PRE>Good morning Ankit,

I believe what you describe is a specific form of what is called the Wormhole attack.
In the general form, the Wormhole attack has two forwarding nodes in a path that are coordinating with each other, and they can &quot;teleport&quot; the preimage from one to the other, skipping intermediate forwarding nodes.

The case you describe is the specific case where one of the nodes performing this attack on a path is the payee itself.

What is stolen here is not the payment amount, but the fees that the &quot;skipped&quot; forwarding nodes should have earned for honestly forwarding.
On the other hand, in that case, it is simply a form of the griefing attack: C and E are able to  cause D to lock its funds into HTLCs without earning fees, but C and E can mount that attack at any time regardless of A or B anyway, so it is not an additional attack surface on D.

At a high level, this attack is not a concern.
As long as A is able to acquire the preimage, it has proof of payment, and it is immaterial *how* A managed to get the preimage, as Rene describes.
Even if E claims that it did not deliberately give the preimage and that it was hacked by C, then it is C who is liable, in which case C and E, being a cooperating team, have gained nothing at all (and just made C angry at E for throwing C under the bus).

Basically, the preimage *is* the proof.
There are only two things you need to do:

* Ensure that invoices are signed by E (meaning E agreed to perform some service if the preimage is revealed by anyone).
  BOLT11 already requires this.
* Ensure that invoices indicate *who exactly* is going to get the service or product.
  Since the preimage is learned by every intermediate hop, it cannot be a bearer certificate, so it must indicate specifically that the beneficiary of the product or service will be A.

With the above, A can be sure that paying in exchange for getting the preimage, is a binding contract on the service indicated by the invoice.
The preimage and the invoice (that has a signature from E), are sufficient to show that E has an obligation to provide a service or product to A.

The wormhole attack (which steals fees from D) is fixed by using PTLCs and blinding factors.
E learns the total of all blinding factors, and knows the final scalar, but does not know the blinding factor delta from C to E, and thus cannot give C any information on how to claim the funds.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj


&gt;<i> Hey Ankit,&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lightning network sees the possession of a preimage as a proof of payment. And I believe everyone agrees that a court should rule in favor of A forcing E to deliver the good or reimburse A. The reason is that possession of the preimage matching the signed payment hash from E is a much stronger evidence of A actually having paid than E claiming to not have received anything.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> This is also due to the fact that guessing the preimage can practically be considered impossible (though there is a tiny likelihood)&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If E breaches the protocol by giving the preimage to C (for free) instead of claiming the money from D (and thus settling the Htlc) it will be considered E's problem, that E did not get reimbursed but just gave out the preimage for free. (actually E's so called &quot;partner in crime&quot; did get reimbursed). Even if D would testify that E never settled the Htlc one would wonder why E never settled the incoming htlc as they should only have created a payment hash for which they know the preimage. Since A can actually provide one it is again unlikely if E for example claims they just used a random hash for which they didn't know the preimage because they wanted to just see if A has enough liquidity.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With kind regards Rene

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Consider A wants to send some funds to E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They don&#8217;t have a direct payment channel among them. So, they use a following path A-B-C-D-E. A is the sender of payment and E is final recipient.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; E sends the hash of a secret r to A, A passes on the hash to B, B to C, C to D, and D to E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; E discloses the secret to C (a partner in crime with E) and E do not respond to D. C gives the secret to B (settling the HTLC between them). Then, B gives the secret to A (settling the HTLC between them).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A sent (and lost) the money, as E denies receiving the money (and the promised service/good).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How the lightening network sees this? Out of their control?
