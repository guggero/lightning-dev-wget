Indeed.

Off-list, Joseph Poon suggested a solution, which I urged him to post
here.  As he hasn't done so, I'll try to paraphrase.

So the basic problem is that A -&gt; C -&gt; E fails because C is
unresponsive: A is waiting (say) 2 days before the HTLC to C times out.

Joseph's solution is that E can route a conditional refund back to A
with a larger timeout (say 3 days) via some other route: this pays back
the amount to A if they present the preimage for the initial stalled
payment and another preimage A only has.  This serves as a guarantee
that E will not reveal the preimage required to take the stalled
payment.

This raises other questions, such as who would pay E (and any other
intermediate nodes) for locking up their money for such a time.  Could A
provide evidence that the route really had timed out?  How many times
can A claim &quot;payment failed&quot;?  etc.

In general, how nodes get paid is an open question; I'll add this to the
pile.  One problem at a time though...

Cheers,
Rusty.
