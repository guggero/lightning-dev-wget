<PRE>Hi Margherita,


can you be a bit more specific about what you mean by double-spend 
attacks?. A double-spend is not an attack that can be performed acting 
solely on the Lightning Network, and as far as I know there are no nodes 
being banned because of this.


If there are nodes that are being banned for tampering or sending wrong 
information on the p2p Lightning Network (such as changing 
channel_announcements or creating others that are wrong) is something I 
am not completely sure (maybe in some implementations? or is it 
specified in BOLT). In any case, this is not a double-spending attack.


Best,


Alejandro.
