</I>&gt;<i> This is one of the cases where a simpler solution (relatively
</I>&gt;<i> speaking ^^) is to be preferred imho, allowing for future
</I>&gt;<i> iterations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think we should strive to splice in 1 on-chain tx, as if not the biggest
benefit really is lost compared to just closing and reopening the channel.

Complexity wise I don't think it will be that much to gain from the 2-tx
proposal as (if I understand the proposal correctly) there will be even
more transaction types with new scripts to code up and maintain.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One thing that I think we should lift from the multiple funding output
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; approach is the &quot;pre seating of inputs&quot;. This is cool as it would allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; clients to generate addresses, that others could deposit to, and then
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be spliced directly into the channel. Public derivation can be used,
</I>&gt;<i> along
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with a script template to do it non-interactively, with the clients
</I>&gt;<i> picking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; up these deposits, and initiating a splice in as needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am uncertain what this means in particular, but let me try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restate what you are talking about in other terms:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  Each channel has two public-key-derivation paths (BIP32) to create
</I>&gt;<i> onchain addresses.  One for each side of the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  When somebody sends to one of the onchain addresses in the path,
</I>&gt;<i> their client detects this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  The client initiates a splice-in automatically from this UTXO paying
</I>&gt;<i> to that address into the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems to me naively that the above can be done by the client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software without any modifications to the Lightning Network BOLT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol, as long as the BOLT protocol is capable of supporting *some*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splice-in operation, i.e. it seems to be something that a client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software can implement as a feature without requiring a BOLT change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or is my above restatement different from what you are talking about?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How about this restatement?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  Each channel has two public-key-derivation paths (BIP32) to create
</I>&gt;<i> onchain addresses.  One for each side of the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  The base of the above is actually a combined private-public keypair
</I>&gt;<i> of both sides (e.g. created via MuSig or some other protocol).  Thus the
</I>&gt;<i> addresses require cooperation of both parties to spend.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  When somebody sends to one of the onchain addresses in the path,
</I>&gt;<i> their client detects this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  The client updates the current transaction state, such that the new
</I>&gt;<i> commit transaction has two inputs ( the original channel transaction and
</I>&gt;<i> the new UTXO).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The above seems unsafe without trust in the other peer, as, the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peer can simply refuse to create the new commit transaction.  Since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the address requires both parties to spend, the money cannot be spent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and there is no backoff transaction that can be used.  But maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can describe some mechanism to ensure this, if this is what is meant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could easily be solved by making the destination address a Taproot
</I>&gt;<i> address, which by default is just a 2-of-2, but in the uncooperative
</I>&gt;<i> case it can reveal the script it commits to, which is just a timelocked
</I>&gt;<i> refund that requires a single-sig. The only problem with this is that
</I>&gt;<i> the refund would be non-interactive, and so the entirety of the funds,
</I>&gt;<i> that may be from a third-party, need to be claimed by one endpoint,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e., there is no splitting the funds in case of an uncollaborative
</I>&gt;<i> refund. Not sure how important that is though, since I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> third-party funds will come from unrelated parties, e.g., most of these
</I>&gt;<i> funds will come from an on-chain wallet that is under the control of
</I>&gt;<i> either parties so the refund should go back to that party anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
