</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, this is the alternative method; produce a parallel funding tx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which only needs to support a single revocation, or could even be done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by a long timeout) and then join them when it reaches the agreed depth.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It has some elegance; particularly because one side doesn't have to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any validation or store anything until it's about to splice in.  You get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asked for a key and signature, you produce a new one, and sign whatever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tx they want.  They hand you back the tx and the key you used once it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buried far enough, and you check the tx is indeed buried and the output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the script you're expecting, then you flip the commitment tx.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I chose chose not to do this because every transaction commitment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forever will require 2 signatures, and doesn't allow us to forget old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revocation information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And it has some strange side-effects: onchain this looks like two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channels; do we gossip about both?  We have to figure the limit on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> splice-in to make sure the commitment tx stays under 400kSipa.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a lot closer to my original proposal for splicing, and I
</I>&gt;<i> still like it a lot more since the transition from old to new
</I>&gt;<i> channel is bascially atomic (not having to update state on both
</I>&gt;<i> pre-splice and post-splice version). The new funds will remain
</I>&gt;<i> unavailable for the same time, and since we allow only one
</I>&gt;<i> concurrent splice in your proposal we don't even lose any
</I>&gt;<i> additional time regarding the splice-outs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So pulling the splice_add_input and splice_add_output up to
</I>&gt;<i> signal the intent of adding funds to a splice. Splice_all_added
</I>&gt;<i> is then used to start moving the funds to a pre-allocated 2-of-2
</I>&gt;<i> output where the funds can mature. Once the funds are
</I>&gt;<i> matured (e.g., 6 confirmations) we can start the transition: both
</I>&gt;<i> parties claim the funding output, and the pre-allocated funds, to
</I>&gt;<i> create a new funding tx which is immediately broadcast, and we
</I>&gt;<i> flip over to the new channel state. No need to keep parallel
</I>&gt;<i> state and then disambiguating which one it was.
</I>
If we're going to do side splice-in like this, I would use a very
different protocol: the reason for this protocol was to treat splice-in
and splice-out the same, and inline splice-in requires wait time.  Since
splice-out doesn't, we don't need this at all.

It would look much more like:

1. Prepare any output with script of specific form. eg:
        OP_DEPTH 3 OP_EQUAL OP_IF
                &lt;funding_pubkey1&gt; &lt;funding_pubkey2&gt; OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
                &lt;blockheight&gt; OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
                &lt;myrescue_pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF

1. type: 40 (`splice_in`) (`option_splice`)
2. data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`: `satoshis`]
   * [`32`: `txid`]
   * [`4`: `txoutnum`]
   * [`4`: `blockheight`]
   * [`33`: `myrescue_pubkey`]

1. type: 137 (`update_splice_in_accept`) (`option_splice`)
   data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`32`: `txid`]
   * [`4`: `txoutnum`]

1. type: 138 (`update_splice_in_reject`) (`option_splice`)
   data:
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`32`: `txid`]
   * [`2`:`len`]
   * [`len`:`errorstr`]

The recipient of `splice_in` checks that it's happy with the
`blockheight` (far enough in future).  Once it sees the tx referred to
buried to its own `minimum_depth`, it checks output is what they
claimed, then sends `update_splice_in_accept`; it's followed up
`commitment_signed` like normal, but from this point onwards, all
commitment txs signatures have one extra sig.

Similarly, splice-out:

1. type: 139 (`update_splice_out`) (`option_splice`)
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`8`: `satoshis`]
   * [`2`: `scriptlen`]
   * [`scriptlen`: `outscript`]

The recipient checks that the output script is standard, and the amount
can be afforded by the other side.  From then on, each commitment tx has
a new output.

Note this doesn't put the splice out on the blockchain!

1. type: 140 (`propose_reopen`) (`option_splice`)
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`4`:`feerate_per_kw`]
   * [`33`:`funding_pubkey`]

This is initiates a mutually-agreed broadcast of the current state: all
inputs (original and spliced), all spliced outputs, and a funding-style
2x2 which has all the remaining funds.  Call this a 'reopen tx'.

This must be done with no outstanding commitments, like closing tx
negotiation, and it's a back-and-forth until both sides agree on
feerate.  Then you send:

1. type: 141 (`reopen_accept`) (`option_splice`)
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`4`:`feerate_per_kw`]
   * [`64`: `new_commitment_sig`]

Once you've received and sent this, you're ready to sign the reopen tx:

1. type: 142 (`reopen`) (`option_splice`)
   * [`32`:`channel_id`]
   * [`64`: `reopen_commitment_sig`]

We need similar 'what happens on reconnect at various points' logic to
the previous one &lt;handwave&gt;.

Once you've sent and received the `reopen`, you can broadcast the reopen
tx at will and start updating again.  If we recommend that public
channels reuse their old `funding_pubkey` then that means that we should
also have gossip continuity for upgraded nodes, and don't need the
previous channel_update hack.

We could add a new `reopen_locked` message which indicates that both
sides are happy with the reopen depth, if we don't want to allow reopens
back-to-back?

&gt;<i> This is one of the cases where a simpler solution (relatively
</I>&gt;<i> speaking ^^) is to be preferred imho, allowing for future
</I>&gt;<i> iterations.
</I>
Unless we can have both :)

Cheers,
Rusty.
