<PRE>Good morning lisa,

This is a good observation.

Before, I'd already considered the rationale, for why channels have a single 2-of-2 UTXO as funding output.  And it seems I should have considered this, prior to accepting the &quot;parallel&quot; construction as feasible.

For sake of posterity, I leave the below writeup as a tangential to the design of splice (and to the design of Lightning having a single 2-of-2 UTXOs):

# 0-conf is Unsafe, Yet Lightning is Safe; Why?

To accept a 0-conf transaction output, is known to be unsafe.  Replace-by-fee is always a possibility, regardless of whether the transaction opts in to RBF or not: a rational miner will always accept the higher feerate, disregarding any &quot;opt-in&quot; flag that is set or not set on the transaction.  Thus we reject any advice that claims that 0-conf is tenable, even for tiny amounts.

Yet when viewed solely in terms of transactions, Lightning protocol uses transactions that are not on any block (are kept offchain).  Since they are not in a block, they are indistinguishable from 0-conf transactions, which are accepted by the receiver, yet are also not on any block.  One might argue the distinction, that a &quot;real&quot; 0-conf transaction exists on some mempool somewhere, and thus has a chance to be on a block in the future, but mempools have no consensus, and the existence of a transaction on some mempool is not a safe assurance of it existing in the mempool of the next winning miner.

So why is Lightning safe, when 0-conf transactions are in general not safe?

Again, we should focus on why 0-conf transactions in general are not safe: transaction replacement.  Thus, 0-conf transactions can be made safe, if you are somehow able to ensure that replacement transactions cannot be made.

For example, if you are part of an n-of-n federation that signs the transaction, you can always safely accept a 0-conf transaction from that federation paying only to you, because you can always veto any replacement (by simply refusing to sign) that is not in your interests.

This is in fact how Lightning works: a 2-of-2 federation (the channel counterparties) are the signatories of the 0-conf transactions that are the commitment transactions of the Lightning protocol.  Replacement of the commitment transactions is strictly guided by the protocol; both sides have veto rights, since the source transaction output is 2-of-2.

Thus, Lightning, though it uses 0-conf transactions, is safe, because it prevents the replacement of a 0-conf transaction without the receiver allowing it, by the simple expedient of including the receiver in the 2-of-2 multisig guarding its single funding TXO.

##  The Implications for Splice Proposals

Some splice proposals involve creating the equivalent of multiple funding TXOs for a single channel.  Such constructions are unsafe-by-default on Poon-Dryja.

In reality, every commitment transaction (or update transaction in Decker-Osuntokun-Russell) is replaceable by any other commitment (or update) transaction for that channel.  Under Poon-Dryja older transactions are revoked (and hence one side risks loss of their collateral) while under Decker-Osuntokun-Russell older transactions may be &quot;gainsaid&quot; (i.e. newer update transactions may be reanchored to consume the TXO of the older update transaction, thus preventing that update from truly being committed to).

This is relevant since before a splice, the channel has a single funding TXO, while after the splice, the channel has multiple.

In particular, a commitment (or update) transaction, that has multiple inputs (to consume the multiple funding TXOs), can be replaced with a commitment (or update) transaction that was created before the splice.  Under Poon-Dryja, such a commitment transaction may be revoked, but this leaves the other funding TXOs unuseable.  Under Decker-Osuntokun-Russell, as long as the sequence number is preserved across the splice, it is possible for a later update transaction with multiple inputs to simply gainsay the old single-input update with the new multiple-input update transaction. (I suppose, that this is another advantage that Decker-Osuntokun-Russell has).

&gt;<i> To add some context to this, if you start accepting HTLC's for the new balance after the parallel commitment is made, but before the re-anchor is buried, there's the potential for a race condition between a unilateral close (or any revoked commitment transaction) and the re-anchoring commitment transaction, that spends the 'pre-committed' UTXO of splicing in funds and the original funding transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can get around this by waiting until both the pre-commitment UTXO and the re-anchor have cleared a minimum depth before accepting HTLC's for the new balance totals, but that's twice as long of a wait as the first, synchronized re-commitment scheme that Rusty originally proposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also makes leaving the original funding transaction 'exposed' (ie Rene's version of parallel splice) untenable, as there's always the risk of an old state being published to consume that input. This foobars your current HTLC commitments.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The recipient of `splice_in` checks that it's happy with the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I came up with increasingly elaborate workarounds, but nothing stuck.
