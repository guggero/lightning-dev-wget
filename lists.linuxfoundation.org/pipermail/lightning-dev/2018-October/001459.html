&gt;&gt;<i> One thing that I think we should lift from the multiple funding output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach is the &quot;pre seating of inputs&quot;. This is cool as it would allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clients to generate addresses, that others could deposit to, and then have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be spliced directly into the channel. Public derivation can be used, along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a script template to do it non-interactively, with the clients picking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up these deposits, and initiating a splice in as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am uncertain what this means in particular, but let me try to
</I>&gt;<i> restate what you are talking about in other terms:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Each channel has two public-key-derivation paths (BIP32) to create onchain addresses.  One for each side of the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  When somebody sends to one of the onchain addresses in the path, their client detects this.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  The client initiates a splice-in automatically from this UTXO paying to that address into the channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me naively that the above can be done by the client
</I>&gt;<i> software without any modifications to the Lightning Network BOLT
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, as long as the BOLT protocol is capable of supporting *some*
</I>&gt;<i> splice-in operation, i.e. it seems to be something that a client
</I>&gt;<i> software can implement as a feature without requiring a BOLT change.
</I>&gt;<i> Or is my above restatement different from what you are talking about?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about this restatement?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Each channel has two public-key-derivation paths (BIP32) to create onchain addresses.  One for each side of the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  The base of the above is actually a combined private-public keypair of both sides (e.g. created via MuSig or some other protocol).  Thus the addresses require cooperation of both parties to spend.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  When somebody sends to one of the onchain addresses in the path, their client detects this.
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  The client updates the current transaction state, such that the new commit transaction has two inputs ( the original channel transaction and the new UTXO).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above seems unsafe without trust in the other peer, as, the other
</I>&gt;<i> peer can simply refuse to create the new commit transaction.  Since
</I>&gt;<i> the address requires both parties to spend, the money cannot be spent
</I>&gt;<i> and there is no backoff transaction that can be used.  But maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> can describe some mechanism to ensure this, if this is what is meant
</I>&gt;<i> instead?
</I>
This could easily be solved by making the destination address a Taproot
address, which by default is just a 2-of-2, but in the uncooperative
case it can reveal the script it commits to, which is just a timelocked
refund that requires a single-sig. The only problem with this is that
the refund would be non-interactive, and so the entirety of the funds,
that may be from a third-party, need to be claimed by one endpoint,
i.e., there is no splitting the funds in case of an uncollaborative
refund. Not sure how important that is though, since I don't think
third-party funds will come from unrelated parties, e.g., most of these
funds will come from an on-chain wallet that is under the control of
either parties so the refund should go back to that party anyway.

Cheers,
Christian
