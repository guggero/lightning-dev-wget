Nevermind, I forgot that the nested header (assuming its the e2e payload)
would be wrapped in layers on onion encryption. So the hop *after* the
rendevous node is hidden from pre-rendevous node anyway :)

&gt;<i> Keep it simple; let's just support regular for now.  Nodes will have to

</I>
Sure. Additionally, as Christian pointed out further down in the thread,
ideally we shoud aim to seamlessly integrate rendevous routing. If possible,
we should keep all onion packets indistinguishable from each other.

&gt;<i> I think we're over-designing.  How about: daily key rotation (which we
</I>&gt;<i> want anywat), remember all onions for current and previous key.
</I>
Yeah only daily key rotation should be sufficient. It seems that we need
either timestamps, or key rotation, not both.

&gt;<i> It'd be great to avoid it, but that seems complex enough to push to a
</I>&gt;<i> future spec.
</I>
Agreed. When I first brought up key rotation eariler in the thread, I noted
it
might be better if it were deferred to a future spec. Nevertheless, the
I've found the resulting discussion very valuable.

&gt;<i> id and comms keys don't have to be bitcoin keys; could be Schnorr.
</I>
The EC Schnorr construction would likely use Bitcoin's curve, so there's no
meaningful distinction there. We're currently constrainted to ECDSA within
Bitcoin, but can freely use EC Schnorr within the network if the space
savings
are desirable (as you pointed out).

</I>
Ahh, I see what you mean now. You're correct, it seems that we may be forced
to drop the per-hop HMAC in order to enable seamless rendevous routing.

&gt;<i> Do we need both a timestamped backlog of secrets and key-rotation? If we
</I>&gt;<i> get the key rotation quick enough it's probably sufficient to simply keep

</I>
Yeah, it seems that key rotation alone is much simpler than the timestamped
log
of secrets. So the key rotation alone should suffice.
