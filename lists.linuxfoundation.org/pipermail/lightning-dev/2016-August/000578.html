</I>&gt;<i> It's possible to get the same *bandwidth* optimization you want, except

</I>&gt;<i> hashes/pubkeys&quot; is you only need to send revocations. Instead, it's

</I>&gt;<i> revocations. In other words, instead of predicting each others' future
</I>&gt;<i> revocation hashes/pubkeys, it's possible to revoke as *part of* giving
</I>&gt;<i> the next revocation hash/pubkey.
</I>
Yeah, I do that already.  We give the N+1th hash when we send the
revocation for N:

        // Complete the update.
        message update_revocation {
          // Hash preimage which revokes old commitment tx.
          required sha256_hash revocation_preimage = 1;
          // Revocation hash for my next commit transaction
          required sha256_hash next_revocation_hash = 2;
        }

The trivial extension is to make in the N+Mth revocation hash, and
instead of sending the first two revocation hashes on establishment,
send the first M+1.

I just wanted to make sure there wasn't some clever alternative I was
missing.  Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille tell me there isn't an obvious
one.

&gt;<i> Not sure how useful this is, though. Seems a lot of complexity for some
</I>&gt;<i> small bandwidth savings, not really that interested in doing all that,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's the closest I can get to what you want. This is off the top of
</I>&gt;<i> my head/memory, I didn't write any notes on this, so parts of this (or
</I>&gt;<i> entirety) might be wrong...
</I>
Yeah, agreed.  Hash trees are nice and simple, so unless we get a
signficiant win, let's stick with that?

Cheers,
Rusty.
