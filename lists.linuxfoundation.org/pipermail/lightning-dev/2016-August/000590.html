Great example; I hadn't considered this particular case before. It's clear
to me now that we should eliminate this potential ambiguity by making the
chain of the target link for each hop along the route explicit.


I was thinking that it'd be stored in the per-hop payload, along with
&gt;<i> the instructions for the hop, which is why I did not specify it, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to add it, should it make things clearer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think the byte specifying the target realm should be protected under a
MAC, as forwarding to the correct realm may be critical in order for the
payment to succeed. Therefore, if we retain the MAC for the per-hop payload
then it can be placed there, otherwise they header may need to extended by
a byte in order to place the realm information there.
