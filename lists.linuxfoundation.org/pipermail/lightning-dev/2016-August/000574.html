&gt;<i> The method of using a revocation key is compatible with shachain/elkrem so
</I>&gt;<i> has log(n) storage; I'll describe what I developed which omits hashing in
</I>&gt;<i> the commit script and uses only signature verification.  If Laolu has made
</I>&gt;<i> a different key revocation scheme I'm not aware, but please do post if so.
</I>
Oh, I blamed Laolu because he told me about it; sorry for misattribution.

&gt;<i> The script is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DUP
</I>&gt;<i> [Revocable Pubkey]
</I>&gt;<i> CHECKSIG
</I>&gt;<i> NOTIF
</I>&gt;<i> [Timeout Pubkey]
</I>&gt;<i> CHECKSIGVERIFY
</I>&gt;<i> [timeout period]
</I>&gt;<i> CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
</I>&gt;<i> ENDIF
</I>
OK, so far so good.

&gt;<i> To build the revocable pubkey, Alice takes their elkrem sender hash from
</I>&gt;<i> state n, which we'll call EHn.  Alice multiples EHn * G, getting a point
</I>&gt;<i> EPn. (Elkrem point n)  Alice sends EPn to Bob, who adds their commitment
</I>&gt;<i> pubkey (BP, which is never seen raw) to EPn.
</I>
&quot;never seen raw on-chain&quot; I assume, since Bob will send it to Alice in
setup?

&gt;<i> The result, (RPub n = BP + EPn), is the revocable pubkey for state n.
</I>&gt;<i> At state n+1, Alice sends Bob EHn.  Bob can then compute the private
</I>&gt;<i> key for Rpub n, as it's just their commitment private key plus EHn,
</I>&gt;<i> modulo the order of the curve.
</I>
So, AFACIT this scheme gives us a slightly smaller script and makes
previous commit transactions underivable.

The property I was *hoping* for was the ability for Alice (and Bob) to
independently predict each others' future revocation hashes/pubkeys.
That would neatly allow an arbitrary number of commitment transactions
in flight each way at once.  Naively, seems like that should be
possible.

&gt;<i> A similar procedure is used for the timeout key; Alice adds a point to
</I>&gt;<i> their own timeout key, which seems kindof pointless because they know both
</I>&gt;<i> scalars.  It obscures the commitment script by making both pubkeys
</I>&gt;<i> different each state, as they're all generated from the hash tree.  Bob
</I>&gt;<i> only needs to keep track of the most recent &quot;elkrem points&quot; and the hash
</I>&gt;<i> tree itself.
</I>
I think changing the timeout key is harmless, but gratuitous; changing
the revocation key is sufficient for each commitment script unguessably
different from the last one, no?

&gt;<i> Hope this is clear and sorry if I'm describing something completely
</I>&gt;<i> different than what you're asking about!
</I>
It's all good; this is a big space and sometimes I don't even know what
I don't know...

Thanks!
Rusty.
