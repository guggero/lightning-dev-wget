&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, I think we should combine the &quot;header&quot; and &quot;per-hop payload&quot; into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single 40 byte field.  They're not meaningfully distinct for lightning,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AFAICT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not clear to me what we gain by squashing the header (hop's ephemeral
</I>&gt;<i> key,
</I>&gt;<i> MAC, next hop) and the per-hop payload (amount to forward, possibly an
</I>&gt;<i> allowed
</I>&gt;<i> CLTV range, etc) into a single blob. I think the extensibility features are
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> same regardless.
</I>
Ephemeral key and mac make sense as a header, but it's fairly easy
to image a different next hop address format for different networks.
See also &quot;realm byte&quot; below.

Thus I'm suggesting a format like:

  [ephemeral key] [mac] [realm] [per-realm-information]

Per-realm-information is next-hop, amount, etc.

&gt;&gt;<i> And I think we should add/steal at least one byte for &quot;realm&quot;.  0 =
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terminal.  1 = bitcoin lightning.  2 = TBA. etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does &quot;terminal&quot; represent in this context?
</I>
You're right; &quot;Terminus&quot; aka &quot;you're the final hop&quot;, rather than using
magic HMAC value.

&gt;<i> I don't think we need an equivalent of Bitcoin's &quot;net magic&quot; bytes within
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> onion blob itself, as I'd imagine that the onion blob would be encapsulated
</I>&gt;<i> within a fixed-length field within the &quot;htlcAdd&quot; message. The &quot;htlcAdd&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> message
</I>&gt;<i> would then have a header similar to Bitcoin's, in which the &quot;net magic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> bytes
</I>&gt;<i> would be placed.
</I>
An explicit network byte makes sense since we could eventually have
multiple networks (atomic cross-chain exchange).  While node keys are
network globally unique (thus the exchange is *implied* by the next
hop), it's nice to be explicit.

We need some flag for the terminal node anyway, so it makes sense IMHO
to expand it.

&gt;&gt;<i> We can't simply deny multiple HTLCs with the same r hash, since that
</I>&gt;<i> allows an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacker to probe the network to see where an HTLC went (note that in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> longer run, it's in a node's short-term economic interest to allow this,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is why rhash is troubling).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We wouldn't deny multiple HTLC's with the same r hash. We'd deny a packet
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> a shared secret we've already seen, meaning one that we've processed
</I>&gt;<i> before.
</I>
Sorry, I was unclear: We're agreeing.  I was clarifying why an
alternative approach to replay avoidance (using r hash uniqueness)
doesn't work.

&gt;<i> (as a side note: I think we should establish some better terminology than
</I>&gt;<i> r-hash, or H)
</I>
Ergh, yes!

Strawman proposal:
1) HTLC-hash and HTLC-preimage? (aha H-hash &amp; H-preimage).
2) committx-hash and committx-preimage (C-hash / C-preimage) for the
   commitment transaction revocation?

That avoids R altogether, which is overloaded...

&gt;&gt;<i> If we switch from hash/preimage to the privkeys with point addition scheme
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which has other benefits) this is no longer an issue and we can simply
</I>&gt;<i> refuse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to accept two HTLCs with the same pubkey.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point addition derivation (P2CH style) scheme only applies to
</I>&gt;<i> revocations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not clear to me how one can switch to priv/pub key based HTLC's without
</I>&gt;<i> modifying Bitcoin Script. At the moment, we're unable to guarantee/force key
</I>&gt;<i> disclosure with Script's current capabilities.
</I>
Yeah, it was easy to miss; it's buried deep in a thread (see the
&quot;alternative approach&quot;):

        <A HREF="../2015-November/000344.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-November/000344.html</A>

Basically, you force r-value reuse in signatures to reveal the private
key.  The script to do this would be pretty big though, involving two
other keys, three signatures and three OP_CHECKMULTISIG.

And AFAIK nobody has actually written such a script...

Cheers,
Rusty.
