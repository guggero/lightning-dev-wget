Yes, I think I agree.

&gt;<i> I'm not clear on the advantages of sending encrypted state information to
</I>&gt;<i> the observer.  Most information the observer needs to construct a punishing
</I>&gt;<i> transaction is available in the observed commitment tx; the only per-state
</I>&gt;<i> information which needs to be stored is the signature (and in the case of
</I>&gt;<i> HTLCs, the preimage).
</I>
Yes.  To be precise, watcher needs preimage, pubkeys, a signature,
OP_CSV delay amounts for each side, and HTLCs.

If the pubkeys and OP_CSV delay amounts are fixed, you need a signature
and preimage (required to steal the to-them output as well as htlcs)
every new commit tx (ie. every new watch request).  And you'll add a new
HTLC information on average every second commit tx.

But I think you're better attaching every relevant HTLC to every watch
request; otherwise, you're exposing all previous HTLCs.  I recalculated:
they're only 24 bytes each (ripemd hash + expiry).

If we really want to optimize that,maybe we can come up with a cleverer
scheme, where you optionally include the key to the previous watch
request with the encrypted information, allowing the sender to control
the privacy/data tradeoff?  Then the watcher would gather HTLCs from
those previous requests as well, and see which ones are required?
{Insert bikeshed here}.  {No, here}.

&gt;<i> Reconstructing messages from hashes and / or
</I>&gt;<i> signatures isn't possible as long as there's sufficient unknown data in the
</I>&gt;<i> preimage or message.  This is achievable by changing the pubkeys used in
</I>&gt;<i> the commit tx script and pubkey hash each state, without needing additional
</I>&gt;<i> data in an OP_RETURN.
</I>
FWIW, I take back the idea about using the signature as a key:
1) While the crypto people tell me it's probably OK, they can't prove it.
2) If we go to Schnorr, I think it falls apart as both sigs are combined.

OTOH, changing pubkeys every step isn't required if we go for Laolu's 
key-revocation scheme instead of shachain/elkrem.  I think? (Roasbeef,
this is your cue to describe it in detail!)

Cheers,
Rusty,
