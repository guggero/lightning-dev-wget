<PRE>&gt;<i> Hmm, I think we should combine the &quot;header&quot; and &quot;per-hop payload&quot; into a
</I>&gt;<i> single 40 byte field.  They're not meaningfully distinct for lightning,
</I>&gt;<i> AFAICT.
</I>
It's not clear to me what we gain by squashing the header (hop's ephemeral
key,
MAC, next hop) and the per-hop payload (amount to forward, possibly an
allowed
CLTV range, etc) into a single blob. I think the extensibility features are
the
same regardless.

&gt;<i> And I think we should add/steal at least one byte for &quot;realm&quot;.  0 =
</I>&gt;<i> terminal.  1 = bitcoin lightning.  2 = TBA. etc.
</I>
What does &quot;terminal&quot; represent in this context?

I don't think we need an equivalent of Bitcoin's &quot;net magic&quot; bytes within
the
onion blob itself, as I'd imagine that the onion blob would be encapsulated
within a fixed-length field within the &quot;htlcAdd&quot; message. The &quot;htlcAdd&quot;
message
would then have a header similar to Bitcoin's, in which the &quot;net magic&quot;
bytes
would be placed.

&gt;<i> We can't simply deny multiple HTLCs with the same r hash, since that
</I>allows an
&gt;<i> attacker to probe the network to see where an HTLC went (note that in the
</I>&gt;<i> longer run, it's in a node's short-term economic interest to allow this,
</I>which
&gt;<i> is why rhash is troubling).
</I>
We wouldn't deny multiple HTLC's with the same r hash. We'd deny a packet
with
a shared secret we've already seen, meaning one that we've processed
before. A
node could still forward multiple HTLC's with identical r-hashes (perhaps
due
to having to fragment a payment due to insufficient link-capacity), these
HTLC's would have distinct (indistinguishable) onion packets.

(as a side note: I think we should establish some better terminology than
r-hash, or H)

&gt;<i> If we switch from hash/preimage to the privkeys with point addition scheme
</I>&gt;<i> (which has other benefits) this is no longer an issue and we can simply
</I>refuse
&gt;<i> to accept two HTLCs with the same pubkey.
</I>
The point addition derivation (P2CH style) scheme only applies to
revocations.
It's not clear to me how one can switch to priv/pub key based HTLC's without
modifying Bitcoin Script. At the moment, we're unable to guarantee/force key
disclosure with Script's current capabilities.
