<PRE>Good morning Christian,

&gt;<i> My issue is with the fact that CLTV-branches and nLocktimed spending
</I>&gt;<i> transactions also need to be guarded with a further `OP_CSV` condition,
</I>&gt;<i> since they may leak on-chain, and be immediately valid. This is the
</I>&gt;<i> reason why we introduced the two stage HTLC resolution, with the first
</I>&gt;<i> stage acting as the `OP_CSV` guard, and keeping the second stage clean.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think therefore the construction of the contract ought to be this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/arbitrary/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (CSV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt; [signA signB witnessCbyA, revoke || A] /* held by A */
</I>&gt;<i> [/arbitrary/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (CSV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt; [signA signB witnessCbyB, revoke || B] /* held by B */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Namely the CSV belongs in the output script, not the input script (which
</I>&gt;<i> is under the control of the spending party). Notice that I might have
</I>&gt;<i> misgroked your syntax :-) If C now contains a CLTV-branch whose timeout
</I>&gt;<i> expires before we attempt the on-chain mediation, suddenly both branches
</I>&gt;<i> become valid and we have a race.
</I>
I believe not.  In the BOLT #3, a received HTLC looks like this:

    ## (revoke) ||
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))&gt; OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        ## B &amp;&amp;
        &lt;remote_htlcpubkey&gt; OP_SWAP
            OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        ## C
        OP_IF
            # To local node via HTLC-success transaction.
            OP_HASH160 &lt;RIPEMD160(payment_hash)&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY
            2 OP_SWAP &lt;local_htlcpubkey&gt; 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node after timeout.
            OP_DROP &lt;cltv_expiry&gt; OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
    OP_ENDIF

The above contains no CSV, and is the output of the second transaction (the one that spends the funding transaction directly).  I annotated the SCRIPT with ## of what I consider each component to be (with A=local, B=remote).  I believe it is equivalent to ((revoke) || B &amp;&amp; C), where C is the HTLC (A &amp;&amp; (x == H(x))) || (CLTV)), with the requirement of A included within C and that this is &quot;simply&quot; an optimization (in principle, we could have required both local and remote HTLC pubkeys for the HTLC, but that just makes our witnesses unnecessarily larger).

It is instead the HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success transactions (which spends from the above script) that have a CSV:

    OP_IF
        ## (revoke) ||
        # Penalty transaction
        &lt;revocationpubkey&gt;
    OP_ELSE
        ## (CSV &amp;&amp; A)
        `to_self_delay`
        OP_CSV
        OP_DROP
        &lt;local_delayedpubkey&gt;
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_CHECKSIG

Which I render as ((revoke) || (CSV &amp;&amp; A)).

The need for the CSV here is precisely what you described, but it comes *after* the contract being enforced, not before.

Thus under Poon-Dryja the CSV occurs on a transaction that is dependent on a CLTV, not the other way around, and the CSV does not interfere with the CLTV. (indeed with current LN the CSV never comes into play during routing; if CSV interfered with CLTV here, then it should have been considered in our routing algorithm. instead we need to plan out this CSV-interference when we eventually move to Decker-Osuntokun-Russell eltoo channels.)

The drawback is that the condition in the second transaction becomes complicated, and thus cleverness like the above eliding of A from A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C is needed to keep witnesses and script size down.

Sincerely,
AmkG
</PRE>
