<PRE>Thanks for the excellent writeup ZmnSCPxj, I just have a minor issue
with your characterization that LN-penalty is to be preferred.

My issue is with the fact that CLTV-branches and nLocktimed spending
transactions also need to be guarded with a further `OP_CSV` condition,
since they may leak on-chain, and be immediately valid. This is the
reason why we introduced the two stage HTLC resolution, with the first
stage acting as the `OP_CSV` guard, and keeping the second stage clean.

I think therefore the construction of the contract ought to be this:

[/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (CSV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt; [signA signB witnessCbyA, revoke || A] /* held by A */
[/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (CSV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt; [signA signB witnessCbyB, revoke || B] /* held by B */

Namely the CSV belongs in the output script, not the input script (which
is under the control of the spending party). Notice that I might have
misgroked your syntax :-) If C now contains a CLTV-branch whose timeout
expires before we attempt the on-chain mediation, suddenly both branches
become valid and we have a race.

Take this for example:

```
OP_IF
  x OP_CLTV
  &lt;checksigs&gt;
OP_ELSE
  &lt;checksigs&gt;
OP_END
```

If we wait until block x was found, we attempt to cheat by publishing
this state, and suddenly both prepared reaction transactions are valid,
resulting in a race. This is simply due to the fact that transactions
can leak. To fix this we'd have to encumber the OP_IF branch with an
additional CSV. So it's not really like we can just add an OR-clause to
an arbitrary contract and we're safe, we actually have to weave it into
the logic, or create a second stage that just disambiguates the cheat
and the non-cheat unilateral case.

With eltoo this sort of weaving falls away, since we guarantee that the
old state can never leak on-chain. If we squint at it we can see that
we have effectively pushed down the second stage into the on-chain state
resolution, allowing us to keep the contracts clean.

Cheers,
Christian

&gt;<i> Good morning list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, somebody on the IRC channel, asked regarding smart contracts
</I>&gt;<i> being transported via LN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, this is theoretically possible, provided the &quot;smart contract&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is implementable as a Bitcoin SCRIPT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Afterwards, I opined that, for transportation of *arbitrary*
</I>&gt;<i> contracts, Poon-Dryja is superior to either Decker-Wattenhofer or
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Osuntokun-Russell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, first, my other opinions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  The only smart contract you really want to transport is HTLC (or
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent in scriptless script).  There really is no point in
</I>&gt;<i> transporting any other contract on LN.  HTLCs can even be used to
</I>&gt;<i> implement (nontransferable) swap options, and can be composed (at the
</I>&gt;<i> cost of increasing CLTV limits on backoff) to create multi-step swaps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Decker-Osuntokun-Russell &quot;eltoo&quot; is far superior to Poon-Dryja
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;LN-penalty&quot; in everything else, except transportation of *arbitrary*
</I>&gt;<i> contracts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, ultimately any Bitcoin SCRIPT may be expressed as a Boolean
</I>&gt;<i> computation whether or not the contract has been fulfilled by the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction that attempts to claim it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I introduce, an arbitrary contract C, ostensibly to be transported
</I>&gt;<i> over LN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I introduce our transactions, as so: [scriptSig, redeemScript] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> redeeming transaction
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To transport C over a channel between nodes A and B, under Poon-Dryja,
</I>&gt;<i> we first have a channel anchoring transaction onchain:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now suppose the entire output is to be put into a contract C. Under
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja, we create the below symmetrical series of transactions,
</I>&gt;<i> with only the anchoring transaction existing onchain:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [signA signB witnessCbyA, revoke || (A &amp;&amp; CSV)] /* held by A */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [signA signB witnessCbyB, revoke || (B &amp;&amp; CSV)] /* held by B */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where (revoke) is the revocation key, whose derivation requires both A
</I>&gt;<i> and B, and whose half is kept secret by the A (resp. B) until they
</I>&gt;<i> both agree to revoke the old state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of note is that the only additional condition added to C is (A &amp;&amp; B),
</I>&gt;<i> which makes sense since the contract is between nodes A and B (and
</I>&gt;<i> which would be implicitly required by the funding transaction anyway).
</I>&gt;<i> The (revoke) || does not affect the enforcement of C if the revocation
</I>&gt;<i> key is not yet revealed; once the revocation key is revealed, that
</I>&gt;<i> revokes the entire sequence of transactions (which is why (revoke) ||
</I>&gt;<i> appears in both the second and third transactions above).  In
</I>&gt;<i> particular, the CSV-encumberance does not affect claiming of C; it
</I>&gt;<i> encumbers the claiming of the money, but does not interact with C
</I>&gt;<i> itself.  Thus, any CLTV conditions in C will not be interefered with
</I>&gt;<i> by the CSV-encumberance on the *next* transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note also that only signA and signB for the final transaction needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be shared; the witnessC can presumably be fulfilled by each side
</I>&gt;<i> themselves automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, under Decker-Osuntokun-Russell eltoo, the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction series is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (CSV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B) || (CLTV &amp;&amp; A
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;&amp; B)] -&gt; [nSequence signA signB, C]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the above is massively simpler with no additional SCRIPT that
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be written, around the transported contract C --- but the CSV
</I>&gt;<i> in the second transaction, is now potentially interfering with the
</I>&gt;<i> operation of the contract C, as the final transaction cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> enforced onchain until the CSV has been satisfied.  This is in
</I>&gt;<i> contrast with the Poon-Dryja case, where the contract C appears
</I>&gt;<i> immediately on the second transaction in the sequence, and can be
</I>&gt;<i> enforced, as soon as it appears onchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In eltoo, the (CTLV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B) branch of the intermediate contract is
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;update&quot; path, and the CLTV required is always a past Unix Epoch
</I>&gt;<i> time, so this CLTV cannot interfere with the contract C).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above consideration, is why I suppose that, *for arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> contracts*, Poon-Dryja is superior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simply, the conclusion is that Decker-Osuntokun-Russell channels
</I>&gt;<i> require a CSV that may interfere with the contract C if C is
</I>&gt;<i> time-sensitive (i.e. has a CLTV or CSV itself), whereas Poon-Dryja
</I>&gt;<i> requires CSV only for revocability, and the CSV cannot prevent the
</I>&gt;<i> enforcement of time-sensitive C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, as I pointed out, even when transporting HTLCs,
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Osuntokun-Russell will require consideration of the CSV on top
</I>&gt;<i> of the CLTV-deltas imposed by intermediary nodes, with weights
</I>&gt;<i> complicated by the fact that CLTV-deltas are summed together but the
</I>&gt;<i> highest CSV is added to the CLTV total, which does not mix well with
</I>&gt;<i> typical route-finding algorithms (most of which assume a simple
</I>&gt;<i> summing of costs, which CLTV-deltas use but CSVs on
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Osuntokun-Russell do not since highest is used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In almost all other ways, Poon-Dryja is inferior:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Does not use nLockTime in a sufficiently clever way.  2.
</I>&gt;<i> Dangerous &quot;toxic waste&quot; (old revoked transactions) which (1) you
</I>&gt;<i> should not recover from your backups and (2) you should not let your
</I>&gt;<i> worst enemy find, because they can publish those onchain and make you
</I>&gt;<i> LOSE MONEY.  3.  Symmetrical chains of transactions, different for
</I>&gt;<i> both parties, instead of a single chain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, arbitrary contracts are not really particularly useful.
</I>&gt;<i> HTLCs seem to me an important building block for digital value
</I>&gt;<i> transfers, and they (and their equivalents under scriptless) are
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient for most practical transfers.  Thus, moving forward,
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Osuntokun-Russell remains a superior technology over
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja.
