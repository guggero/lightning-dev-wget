<PRE>Thanks for this ZmnSCPxj, very interesting.

A couple of follow ups please:

1) Poon-Dryja (LN penalty), Decker-Wattenhofer and Decker-Osuntokun-Russell
(eltoo) just refer to the process for claiming funds when an old state is
broadcast? Poon-Dryja doesn't require a soft fork but
Decker-Osuntokun-Russell does?
2) How does Decker-Wattenhofer claim funds when an old state is broadcast?

&gt;<i> Good morning list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, somebody on the IRC channel, asked regarding smart contracts
</I>&gt;<i> being transported via LN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, this is theoretically possible, provided the &quot;smart contract&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> implementable as a Bitcoin SCRIPT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Afterwards, I opined that, for transportation of *arbitrary* contracts,
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja is superior to either Decker-Wattenhofer or
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Osuntokun-Russell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, first, my other opinions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  The only smart contract you really want to transport is HTLC (or
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent in scriptless script).  There really is no point in transporting
</I>&gt;<i> any other contract on LN.  HTLCs can even be used to implement
</I>&gt;<i> (nontransferable) swap options, and can be composed (at the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> increasing CLTV limits on backoff) to create multi-step swaps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Decker-Osuntokun-Russell &quot;eltoo&quot; is far superior to Poon-Dryja
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;LN-penalty&quot; in everything else, except transportation of *arbitrary*
</I>&gt;<i> contracts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, ultimately any Bitcoin SCRIPT may be expressed as a Boolean
</I>&gt;<i> computation whether or not the contract has been fulfilled by the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction that attempts to claim it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I introduce, an arbitrary contract C, ostensibly to be transported over
</I>&gt;<i> LN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I introduce our transactions, as so: [scriptSig, redeemScript] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> redeeming transaction
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To transport C over a channel between nodes A and B, under Poon-Dryja, we
</I>&gt;<i> first have a channel anchoring transaction onchain:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now suppose the entire output is to be put into a contract C. Under
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja, we create the below symmetrical series of transactions, with
</I>&gt;<i> only the anchoring transaction existing onchain:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [signA signB witnessCbyA, revoke || (A &amp;&amp; CSV)] /* held by A */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (revoke) || (A &amp;&amp; B &amp;&amp; C)] -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [signA signB witnessCbyB, revoke || (B &amp;&amp; CSV)] /* held by B */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where (revoke) is the revocation key, whose derivation requires both A and
</I>&gt;<i> B, and whose half is kept secret by the A (resp. B) until they both agree
</I>&gt;<i> to revoke the old state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of note is that the only additional condition added to C is (A &amp;&amp; B),
</I>&gt;<i> which makes sense since the contract is between nodes A and B (and which
</I>&gt;<i> would be implicitly required by the funding transaction anyway).  The
</I>&gt;<i> (revoke) || does not affect the enforcement of C if the revocation key is
</I>&gt;<i> not yet revealed; once the revocation key is revealed, that revokes the
</I>&gt;<i> entire sequence of transactions (which is why (revoke) || appears in both
</I>&gt;<i> the second and third transactions above).  In particular, the
</I>&gt;<i> CSV-encumberance does not affect claiming of C; it encumbers the claiming
</I>&gt;<i> of the money, but does not interact with C itself.  Thus, any CLTV
</I>&gt;<i> conditions in C will not be interefered with by the CSV-encumberance on the
</I>&gt;<i> *next* transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note also that only signA and signB for the final transaction needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> shared; the witnessC can presumably be fulfilled by each side themselves
</I>&gt;<i> automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, under Decker-Osuntokun-Russell eltoo, the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> series is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [/*arbitrary*/, A &amp;&amp; B] -&gt; [signA signB, (CSV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B) || (CLTV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp;
</I>&gt;<i> B)] -&gt; [nSequence signA signB, C]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the above is massively simpler with no additional SCRIPT that needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be written, around the transported contract C --- but the CSV in the second
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, is now potentially interfering with the operation of the
</I>&gt;<i> contract C, as the final transaction cannot be enforced onchain until the
</I>&gt;<i> CSV has been satisfied.  This is in contrast with the Poon-Dryja case,
</I>&gt;<i> where the contract C appears immediately on the second transaction in the
</I>&gt;<i> sequence, and can be enforced, as soon as it appears onchain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In eltoo, the (CTLV &amp;&amp; A &amp;&amp; B) branch of the intermediate contract is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;update&quot; path, and the CLTV required is always a past Unix Epoch time, so
</I>&gt;<i> this CLTV cannot interfere with the contract C).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above consideration, is why I suppose that, *for arbitrary contracts*,
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja is superior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simply, the conclusion is that Decker-Osuntokun-Russell channels require a
</I>&gt;<i> CSV that may interfere with the contract C if C is time-sensitive (i.e. has
</I>&gt;<i> a CLTV or CSV itself), whereas Poon-Dryja requires CSV only for
</I>&gt;<i> revocability, and the CSV cannot prevent the enforcement of time-sensitive
</I>&gt;<i> C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, as I pointed out, even when transporting HTLCs,
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Osuntokun-Russell will require consideration of the CSV on top of
</I>&gt;<i> the CLTV-deltas imposed by intermediary nodes, with weights complicated by
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that CLTV-deltas are summed together but the highest CSV is added
</I>&gt;<i> to the CLTV total, which does not mix well with typical route-finding
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms (most of which assume a simple summing of costs, which
</I>&gt;<i> CLTV-deltas use but CSVs on Decker-Osuntokun-Russell do not since highest
</I>&gt;<i> is used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In almost all other ways, Poon-Dryja is inferior:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Does not use nLockTime in a sufficiently clever way.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Dangerous &quot;toxic waste&quot; (old revoked transactions) which (1) you
</I>&gt;<i> should not recover from your backups and (2) you should not let your worst
</I>&gt;<i> enemy find, because they can publish those onchain and make you LOSE MONEY.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Symmetrical chains of transactions, different for both parties,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of a single chain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, arbitrary contracts are not really particularly useful.
</I>&gt;<i> HTLCs seem to me an important building block for digital value transfers,
</I>&gt;<i> and they (and their equivalents under scriptless) are sufficient for most
</I>&gt;<i> practical transfers.  Thus, moving forward, Decker-Osuntokun-Russell
</I>&gt;<i> remains a superior technology over Poon-Dryja.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
