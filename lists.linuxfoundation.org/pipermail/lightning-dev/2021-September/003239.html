<PRE>Good morning again Joost,

&gt;<i> However, we can do &quot;pay for signature&quot; protocols using PTLCs, and rather than requesting for a scalar behind a point as the proof-of-payment, we can instead ask for a signature of a message that attests &quot;this recipient got paid `payment_amount` with `encoded_order_details`&quot; and have a recipient pubkey (not necessarily the node key, it might be best to reduce signing for node keys) as the signing key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems to me that this cannot work with hashes, but can work with PTLCs if we use pay-for-signature and the proof-of-payment is a signature rather than a scalar.
</I>
No, it does not work either.

The reason is that for signing, we need an `R` as well.
Typically, this is a transient keypair generated by the signer as `r = rand(); R = r * G`.

In order to set up a pay-for-signature, the sender needs to know an `R` from the recipient, and the recipient, being the signer, has to generate that `R` for itself.
And if you are just going to do something like sender-&gt;request-&gt;receiver, receiver-&gt;R-&gt;sender, and *then* do the sender-&gt;PTLC-&gt;receiver, then you might as well just do sender-&gt;request-&gt;receiver, receiver-&gt;invoice-&gt;sender, sender-&gt;PTLC-&gt;receiver.

I think your goal, as I understand it, is to reduce it to one round, i.e. sender-&gt;PTLC+some_data-&gt;receiver, then receiver responds to the PTLC that somehow generates the proof-of-payment.
Is my understanding correct?

We cannot have the sender generate the `r` and `R = r * G` as knowledge of `r`, `s` and the signed message `m` results in learning the privkey `a`:

    s = r - a * h(R | m)
    a = (r - s) / h(R | m)

Even with MuSig2 we need a separate round for `R` establishment before the round where everyone gives shares of `s`, and one can argue that a proof-of-payment, being an agreement of the sender and a receiver, is semantically equivalent to a 2-of-2 signature of both sender and the receiver signing off on the fact that the payment happened.
Thus, it seems to me that we can adapt any *secure* single-round multisignature Schnorr scheme to this problem of needing a single-round pay-for-signature.


Perhaps another mechanism?
WARNING: THIS IS NOVEL CRYPTOGRAPHY I THOUGHT UP IN FIVE MINUTES AND I AM NOT A CRYPTOGRAPHER, DO NOT ROLL YOUR OWN CRYPTO.

Instead of having a single receiver-scalar, the receiver knows two scalars.

   A = a * G
   B = b * G

The sender knows both `A` and `B`.

Now, suppose sender wants to make a payment to the receiver.
At its simplest, the sender can simply add `A + B` and lock an outgoing PTLC to that point.
The proof-of-payment is the sum `a + b`, but knowledge of this sum does not imply knowledge of either `a` or `b` (I THINK --- I AM NOT A CRYPTOGRAPHER).

Now, suppose we want a proof-of-payment to be keyed to some data.
We can translate that data to a scalar (e.g. just hash it) and call it `d`.
Then the sender makes a payment to the receiver using this point:

    d * A + B

The sender then receives the scalar behind the above point:

    d * a + b

Even with knowledge of `d`, the sender cannot learn either `a` or `b` and thus cannot synthesize any other proof-of-payment with a different `d`, thus &quot;locking&quot; the proof-of-payment to a specific `d`.

The above proof-of-payment is sufficient by showing the point `d * A + B`, the committed data `d`, and the receiver public keys `A` and `B`.

AGAIN THIS IS NOVEL CRYPTOGRAPHY I THOUGHT UP IN FIVE MINUTES AND I AM NOT A CRYPTOGRAPHER, THIS NEEDS ACTUAL MATHEMATICAL REVIEW FROM AN ACTUAL CRYPTOGRAPHER.
