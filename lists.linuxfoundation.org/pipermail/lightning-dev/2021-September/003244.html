Not completely sure what you mean by full network compatibility, but a
network-wide upgrade including all routing nodes isn't needed. I think to
do it cleanly we need a new tag for bolt11 and node implementations that
carry over the contents of this field to a tlv record. So senders do need
to support this.


&gt;<i> But I think just having 1 already improves the situation a lot, and there
</I>&gt;<i> are application-specific workarounds that can be applied for 2 (having a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed, hardcoded set of possible orders, encoding the order very minimally
</I>&gt;<i> in the payment secret or route hint, storing order details on redis for
</I>&gt;<i> only 3 minutes and using lnurlpay to reduce the delay between invoice
</I>&gt;<i> issuance and user confirmation to zero, and so on).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A stateless invoice API would be a great thing to have. I've prototyped
this in lnd and if you implement it so that a regular invoice is inserted
'just in time', it isn't too involved as you say.
