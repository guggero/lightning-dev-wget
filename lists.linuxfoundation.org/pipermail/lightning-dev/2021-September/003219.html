Indeed, in practice this is what we all do today. My point is less that you cannot create a single unit out of all the various things you consider and more that doing so involves some heuristics on the part of the application developer. There is no &#8220;correct&#8221; or &#8220;optimal&#8221; answer to how to do this, only various designs different folks have. How you balance competing costs may lead to different score units (eg instead of msat, probability of success) and that&#8217;s fine, neither is provably better than the other.
