<PRE>Please be careful accepting the faulty premise that the proposed algorithm is &#8220;optimal&#8221;. It is optimal under a specific heuristic used to approximate what the user wants. In reality, there are a ton of different things to balance, from CLTV to feed to estimated failure probability calculated from node online percentages at-open liquidity, and even fees. There is no such thing as &#8220;optimal&#8221;, only heuristics for how to balance these things into a score that you can feed into a routing algorithm.

I find this framing sufficiently insulting to the serious discussion people have had on this topic that I&#8217;m not really sure where to go from here aside from ignoring it.

</I>&gt;<i> I am a bit worried with a path which relies on constantly finding new heuristics to approximate a solution to an NP-hard problem:
</I>&gt;<i> * It allows too much room for nonconstructive disagreement between LN developers in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>  - In a worst case scenario, all implementations end up using different, incompatible heuristics because each group of developers thinks that they have the best one, leading to a suboptimal performance for everyone. Heuristics are less of an exact science after all.
</I>&gt;<i> * It makes the job of node operators less predictable, since it would depend more on the decisions of said developers with no guarantee of convergence to a single solution.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Node operators may perceive this as loss of decentralization to the developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such an approach is much more suitable to debian, since they have full control and a complete view over their &quot;network&quot; of packages, as opposed to LN, which is decentralized, nodes come and go at will and they can be private (even from developers!).
