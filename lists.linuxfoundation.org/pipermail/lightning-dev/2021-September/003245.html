<PRE>Hi Joost,

Concept ACK, I had toyed with something similar a while ago, but I hadn't
realized
that invoice storage was such a DoS vector for merchants/hubs and wasn't
sure it
would be useful.

Do you have an example of what information you would usually put in your
`encoded_order_details`?

I'd imagine that it would usually be simply a skuID from the merchant's
product
database, but it could also be fully self-contained data to identify a
&quot;transaction&quot;
(probably encrypted with a key belonging to the payee).

We'd want to ensure that this field is reasonably small, to ensure it can
fit in
onions without forcing the sender to use shorter routes or disable other
features.

Cheers,
Bastien

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only 3 minutes and using lnurlpay to reduce the delay between invoice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issuance and user confirmation to zero, and so on).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
