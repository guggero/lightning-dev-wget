<PRE>Good morning Matt and all,

&gt;<i> Please be careful accepting the faulty premise that the proposed algorithm is &#8220;optimal&#8221;. It is optimal under a specific heuristic used to approximate what the user wants. In reality, there are a ton of different things to balance, from CLTV to feed to estimated failure probability calculated from node online percentages at-open liquidity, and even fees.
</I>
It may be possible to translate all these &quot;things to balance&quot; to a single unit, the millisatoshi.

* CLTV-delta
  - The total CLTV-delta time is the worst-case amount of time that your outgoing payment will be stalled.
  - We can compute the expected nominal rate of return if the funds were instead put in a random Bitcoin-denominated investment, getting back a conversion ratio from time units to percentage of your funds.
    This is what C-Lightning already does via the `riskfactor` parameter.
* Node failure probablity
  - Can be multiplied with channel failure probability (the one based on the channel capacity).
  - As I pointed out elsewhere, we can ask the user &quot;up to how much are you willing to pay in fees?&quot;, and that amount is the cost of failure (because economics; see my other mail); the failure probability times the cost of failure is the effective cost of this path.
* Fees
  - Are already denominated in millisatoshi.

One unit to rule them all....


Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
