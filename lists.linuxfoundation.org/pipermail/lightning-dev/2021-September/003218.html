<PRE>Gentlemen,

The micropayment system that is LN today has some limitations in
pathfinding with hops accommodating the needed liquidity with regards
to larger amounts, where probability of success and the forward fee
also needs to be accounted for in a total cost of attempt.

Probability and cost for xx M sats will not today have any gain
compared to go on-chain.

If still in need and or requested to have tx in a near instantaneous
settlement using LN regularly,
one would have a setup of LN-Nodes in aggregate to facilitate tx with
such profiles.

If Lady Gaga would like to send 0.6 to Madonna in a LN tx for
remuneration of a designer purse,
for Us to be able to facilitate that : We would need to onboard them first ...

If A would like to send 0.6 to B, in a non anticipated recurring flow,
A would just go on-chain,
or A would open a channel with --push amt to B, probability asserted
and cost minimised.

In an anticipated recurring flow, I repeat -one would have a setup of
LN-Nodes in aggregate to facilitate liquidity in such a scenario, as I
am sure Baller and Bird ++ other biz already do today.

There is a proposal in changing the protocol to accommodate an
algorithm to do pathfinding and spontaneously make larger payments
possible in LN, where proposal fails directly in that it has a non
real world scenario as argument.

Calculating total cost in a 0.6 balance transfer involving a MPP split
to 500 120K tx to use a hop sequence as a-b-c-d, would require 4000
ledger entries ? ( 2 at each node ) in 1002 LN-Nodes and the
probability of success is &#8776; ?, with a ppm fee forward cost &gt; then what
We in the real world would use and spend today.

As an application developer wishing to use LN protocol pure and
interoperable whole, I can see there are more pressing needs in
refining existing protocol and implementations than spend wetware time
on hypothetical non real world scenarios. Altho still amusing and
stimulating as edutainment.

Thank you
