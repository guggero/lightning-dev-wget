<PRE>Indeed, sorry, I misunderstood it because I read AMP/keysend and assumed
you were talking about payer-generated preimage.
It doesn't help that &quot;payer&quot; and &quot;payee&quot; are so similar words.

So yes, I agree very much.

I also think the part about including the order details inside the TLV
would be very good to have.

I would say, however, that these are two separate proposals:

  1. implementations should expose a &quot;stateless invoice&quot; API for receiving
using the payment_secret;
  2. when sending, implementations should attach a TLV record with encoded
order details.

Of these, 1 is very simple to do and do not require anyone to cooperate, it
just works.

2 requires full network compatibility, so it's harder. But 2 is also very
much needed otherwise the payee has to keep track of all the invoice ids
related to the orders they refer to, right? But I think just having 1
already improves the situation a lot, and there are application-specific
workarounds that can be applied for 2 (having a fixed, hardcoded set of
possible orders, encoding the order very minimally in the payment secret or
route hint, storing order details on redis for only 3 minutes and using
lnurlpay to reduce the delay between invoice issuance and user confirmation
to zero, and so on).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tlv_record_a) and resolves it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way to do this that I tried to describe in the initial post is via the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've implemented such a scheme on @lntxbot, but it required low level

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payloads were not an option (as payers wouldn't know how to send them) I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used a &quot;shadow&quot; route hint to a private channel that didn't exist, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preimage was generated on the payee using preimage = hmac(local_secret,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next_channel_scid).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clever workaround.
