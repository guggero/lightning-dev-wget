</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preimage = H(node_secret | payment_secret | payment_amount |
</I>&gt;<i> encoded_order_details)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; invoice_hash = H(preimage)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The sender sends an htlc locked to invoice_hash for payment_amount and
</I>&gt;<i> passes along payment_secret and encoded_order_details in a custom tlv
</I>&gt;<i> record.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When the recipient receives the htlc, they reconstruct the preimage
</I>&gt;<i> according to the formula above. At this point, all data is available to do
</I>&gt;<i> so. When H(preimage) indeed matches the htlc hash, they can settle the
</I>&gt;<i> payment knowing that this is an order that they committed to earlier.
</I>&gt;<i> Settling could be implemented as a just-in-time inserted invoice to keep
</I>&gt;<i> the diff small.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The preimage is returned to the sender and serves as a proof of payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this actually work?
</I>&gt;<i> How does the sender know the `invoice_hash` to lock the HTLC(s) to?
</I>

&gt;<i> If the sender does not know the `node_secret` (from its name, I am
</I>&gt;<i> guessing it is a secret known only by the recipient?) then it cannot
</I>&gt;<i> compute `invoice_hash`, the `invoice_hash` has to be somehow learned by the
</I>&gt;<i> sender from the recipient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So to be clear: this isn't a spontaneous payment protocol with
proof-of-payment. The sender will still request an invoice from the
recipient via an ordinary http request (think of a paywall with qr invoice
that is presented when web-browsing to a paid article). That is also how
the sender learns the invoice_hash. It is part of the bolt11 payment
request as it always is.

The goal of the scheme is to alleviate the recipient from storing the
invoices that they generate.
