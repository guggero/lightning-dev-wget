<PRE>Hi Joost,

&gt;<i> The conventional approach is to create a lightning invoice on a node and
</I>&gt;<i> store the invoice together with order details in a database. If the order
</I>&gt;<i> then goes unfulfilled, cleaning processes remove the data from the node
</I>&gt;<i> and database again.
</I>
&gt;<i> The problem with this setup is that it needs protection against unbounded
</I>&gt;<i> generation of payment requests. There are solutions for that such as rate
</I>&gt;<i> limiting, but wouldn't it be nice if invoices can be generated without the
</I>&gt;<i> need to keep any state at all?
</I>
Isn't this ultimately an engineering issue? How much exactly is &quot;too much&quot;
in this case? Invoices are relatively small, and also don't even necessarily
need to be ever written to disk assuming a slim expiration window. It's
likely the case that a service can just throw everything in Redis and call
it a day. In terms of rate limiting a service would likely already need to
implement that on the API/service level to mitigate app level DoS attacks.

As far as pre-images go, this can already be &quot;stateless&quot; by generating a
single random seed (storing that somewhere w/ a counter likely) and then
using shachain or elkrem to deterministically generate payment hashes. You
can then either use the payment_addr/secret to index into the hash chain, or
have the user send some counter extracted from the invoice as a custom
record. Similar schemes have been proposed in the past to support &quot;offline&quot;
vending machine payments.

Taking it one step further, the service could maintain a unique
elkrem/shachain state for each unique user, which would then allow them to
also collapse the pre-image into the hash chain, which lets them save space
and be able to reproduce a given &quot;proof that someone in the world paid&quot;
(that no service/wallet seems to accept/generate in an
automated/standardized manner) statement dynamically.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stateless invoices
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would happen if a lightning invoice is only generated and stored
</I>&gt;<i> nowhere on the recipient side? To the user, it won't make a difference.
</I>&gt;<i> They would still scan and pay the invoice. When the payment arrives at the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient though, two problems arise:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Recipient doesn't know whom or what the payment is for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This can be solved by attaching additional custom tlv records to the htlc.
</I>&gt;<i> On the wire, this is all arranged for. The only missing piece is the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to specify additional data for that custom tlv record in a bolt11
</I>&gt;<i> invoice. One way would be to define a new tagged field for this in which
</I>&gt;<i> the recipient can encode the order details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An alternative is to use the existing invoice description field and simply
</I>&gt;<i> always pass that along with the htlc as a custom tlv record.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A second alternative that already works today is to use part (for example
</I>&gt;<i> 16 out of 32 bytes) of the payment_secret (aka payment address) to encode
</I>&gt;<i> the order details in. This assumes that the secret is still secret enough
</I>&gt;<i> with reduced entropy. Also there may not be enough space for every
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Recipient doesn't know the preimage that is needed to settle the
</I>&gt;<i> htlc(s).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One option is to use a keysend payment or AMP payment. In that case, the
</I>&gt;<i> sender includes the preimage with the htlc. Unfortunately this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> provide the sender with a proof of payment that they'd get with a regular
</I>&gt;<i> lightning payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An alternative solution is to use a deterministic preimage based on a
</I>&gt;<i> (recipient node key-derived) secret, the payment secret and other relevant
</I>&gt;<i> properties. This allows the recipient to derive the same preimage twice:
</I>&gt;<i> Once when the lightning invoice is generated and again when a payment
</I>&gt;<i> arrives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It could be something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> payment_secret = random
</I>&gt;<i> preimage = H(node_secret | payment_secret | payment_amount |
</I>&gt;<i> encoded_order_details)
</I>&gt;<i> invoice_hash = H(preimage)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sender sends an htlc locked to invoice_hash for payment_amount and
</I>&gt;<i> passes along payment_secret and encoded_order_details in a custom tlv
</I>&gt;<i> record.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the recipient receives the htlc, they reconstruct the preimage
</I>&gt;<i> according to the formula above. At this point, all data is available to do
</I>&gt;<i> so. When H(preimage) indeed matches the htlc hash, they can settle the
</I>&gt;<i> payment knowing that this is an order that they committed to earlier.
</I>&gt;<i> Settling could be implemented as a just-in-time inserted invoice to keep
</I>&gt;<i> the diff small.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The preimage is returned to the sender and serves as a proof of payment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Resilience
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me it seems that stateless invoices can be a relatively simple way to
</I>&gt;<i> improve the resiliency of systems that deal with lightning invoices.
</I>&gt;<i> Unlimited amounts of invoices can be generated without worrying about
</I>&gt;<i> storage or memory, no matter if the requests are due to popularity of a
</I>&gt;<i> service or a deliberate dos attack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interested to hear your thoughts.
