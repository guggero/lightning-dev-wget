<PRE>Jumping in late to this thread.

I very much agree with how David Harding presents things, with a few comments inline.

</I>
Indeed - UTXO set size is an externality that unfortunately Bitcoin's consensus rules fail to account
for. Having a relay policy that avoids at the very least economically irrational behavior makes
perfect sense to me.

It's also not obvious how consensus rules could deal with this, as you don't want consensus rules
with hardcoded prices/feerates. There are possibilities with designs like transactions getting
a size/weight bonus/penalty, but that's both very hardforky, and hard to get right without
introducing bad incentives.

</I>
My personal, and possibly controversial, opinion is that colored coin protocols have no business being on the Bitcoin chain, possibly
beyond committing to an occasional batched state update or so. Both because there is little benefit for tokens with a trusted
issuer already, and because it competes with using Bitcoin for BTC - the token that pays for its security (at least as long as
the subsidy doesn't run out).

Of course, personal opinions are no reason to dictate what people should or can use the chain for, but I do think it's reason to
voice hesitancy to worsening the system's scalability properties only to benefit what I consider misguided use.

&gt;<i> &gt; 5.  should we ever do confidential transactions we can't prevent it without

</I>
Yeah, range proofs have a non-hidden range; the lower bound can be nonzero, which could be required as part of a relay policy.

Cheers,
