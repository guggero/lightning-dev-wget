</I>&gt;<i> that he signed.
</I>
No, if A pass the unsigned commitment to B then B can malleate the anchor.
(because B would know the txid of the anchor at broadcast time)
B does not have to verify it is in right format, because he does not have
anything to loose by signing a random hash.
B can verify he signed the hash of the first commitment after A announce
his already confirmed anchor.

&gt;<i> Someone other than B (ie a third party) could malleate the anchor between
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast and confirmation just for their own amusement.
</I>
Yes, actually the only malleability vector which B can use to his advantage
is HighS, not all BIP62 vectors.
Knowing miners will most likely run at least 0.11.2 (if CLTV is acceepted)
HighS should be more likely rejected.

&gt;<i> B can't reuse pubkeys between different channels with this protocol
</I>&gt;<i> either, but that's good practice anyway.
</I>
Right, neither A should. If A reuse a key, then B can guess the redeem
hash, then would identify the transaction to malleate at broadcast time,
before A's announcement.

I'd prefer seggregated witness to fix the problem cleanly, but I think that
opening the channel as I said is a good enough workaround until it happen.
The only attack B can try is malleate all transaction to HighS.
When CLTV will pass, there is not lot of probability of such attack to
succeed, because bitcoind should block HighS.

&gt;<i> 'without timeout' is only possible with OP_CSV - not naturally
</I>with what we have currently. ;)

The anchor does not have to use OP_CSV at all. But yes, for commitment, I'm
assuming OP_CSV passed.

&gt;<i> To be able to build a valid payment channel on top of the anchor,
</I>B has to be sure that A cannot get her money back at any point in the
future. Given just a hash that B should sign, B has no clue what is
the output of the transaction he just signed.

Actually B do not care about it. Remember I am separating &quot;A's anchor
broadcast&quot; from &quot;A's announcement of anchor to B&quot;.
When A announce the anchor, then B can check if he really signed the first
commitment or something else, but he can't malleate anything since the
anchor is already confirmed.
B does not have anything to loose by signing unknown hash. (if he use a non
reusable key)

Again, yes, a network-wide HighS attack would be the only way to malleate
the anchor.
If CLTV fork pass, then it is fair to consider that the odd of such attack
succeeding is very low. HighS should be blocked from 0.11.1 if I remember
well.
