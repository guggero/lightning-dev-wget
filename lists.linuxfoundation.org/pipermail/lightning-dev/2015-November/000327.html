&gt;<i> I've joked that BIP62 is the &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; BIP in that it addresses many
</I>&gt;<i> vectors for txid malleability, but maybe there are more.  And more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, it addresses 3rd party malleability.  It's not helpful in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of lightning channel creation because ECDSA sigs are inherently
</I>&gt;<i> malleable.  You can always re-sign the same message with a different
</I>&gt;<i> k-value and get a different signature.
</I>
Yeah, that's why the deployable lightning model used single-sided
funding (the escape tx model also works).

&gt;<i> The functionality that's needed is to be able to reliably spend from
</I>&gt;<i> unconfirmed transactions.  Segregated witness can accomplish that, but it
</I>&gt;<i> quite a large hard-fork change.
</I>
The excitement is because the proposal is to soft-forked it in.  Seems
like it might work, but I'll have to see how ugly it is.

&gt;<i> sighash_noinput can also accomplish that:
</I>&gt;<i> as input txids are not signed, if they change, the spending transaction can
</I>&gt;<i> be modified while leaving counterparty signatures intact.
</I>
I was trying to a new OP_CHECKSIG2, because I'm fairly sure we're going
to take years to winnow down the set of features.  I expect it will
logjam on &quot;new sig flags&quot; &quot;schnorr!&quot; &quot;scriptable signature parts&quot; etc...

&gt;<i> I'm hoping to start a new &quot;testnet-L&quot; similar to testnet3, with this
</I>&gt;<i> sighash type so that we can test malleability mitigation out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Oh also, hi mailing list, sorry I have not posted till now!  But I will
</I>&gt;<i> start posting!)

Welcome :)

Cheers,
Rusty.
