So in addition: if Bob is forwarding an HTLC from Alice to Carol, then,
assuming:

  Bob knows Alice's f, call it f_a;
  Bob knows the CSV delay on his channel with Alice, call it d_a;
  Bob knows the CSV delay on his channel with Carol, call it d_c;
  Bob knows his own f and n;
  Bob knows the timeout on the incoming HTLC, T_a

  Bob wants to work out the timeout to set on the outgoing HTLC, T_b.

In order to keep the channel with Alice open, he needs to resolve the
outgoing HTLC by time T_a-d_a-f_a. And the time he's sure his outgoing
HTLC is done is T_b+f+n, so:

  T_b+f+n &lt;= T_a-d_a-f_a

  T_b &lt;= T_a - d_a - f_a - f - n

Also, Bob wants T_b-d-f &gt; now, or there's no point forwarding the HTLC since
he'd have to close the channel immediately, so:

  now + d + f &lt; T_b &lt;= T_a - d_a - f_a - f - n

gives you constraints on the forwarded timeout based on, I think, fairly
meaningful parameters.

(You might want to add further constraints on the timeout based on fees,
of course -- the above is what you need to avoid being left holding
the bag)

Cheers,
aj
