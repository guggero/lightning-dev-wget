</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   OP_SIZE 57 OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY &lt;P&gt; OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To satisfy this script, you have to generate a signature with P, that
</I>&gt;<i> produces &lt;r&gt; and &lt;s&gt; parameters for the signature that have a combined
</I>&gt;<i> total of 15 leading zero bytes (or more). There is a known &lt;r&gt; value with
</I>&gt;<i> 11 leading zero bytes though: g^(1/2), so you need to brute force about
</I>&gt;<i> 2**32=4B &lt;s&gt; parameters to get a valid signature, and that's just modifing
</I>&gt;<i> the transaction, hashing it, and doing modular arithmetic ops.  It might
</I>&gt;<i> mean paying for a few seconds use of dedicated mining hardware though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using that &lt;r&gt; value reveals the secret key p: p = (2s - h)/r (mod O(g)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to cheat, you can brute force a secret key N with
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding public key r with as many leading zero bytes as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Greg Maxwell thinks grinding r values at a rate 0.08 microseconds per
</I>&gt;<i> try is practical, so that's ~10e6/second. Doing that on 2000 8-core
</I>&gt;<i> machines for abut a week gets you an r-value with 7 leading 0-bytes.
</I>&gt;<i> Getting 8 leading 0-bytes might take 20k machines and four months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With 7 leading zeroes in r, you still need 8 leading zeroes in s, which
</I>&gt;<i> would require about 213,000 GH/s worth of mining hardware running for 24
</I>&gt;<i> hours to achieve. With 8 leading zeroes in r, you'd only need 7 leading
</I>&gt;<i> zeroes in s, which you could get in 1 hour with 20GH/s of mining hardware.
</I>
Yes, this is very clever.  But since it's slow, insecure or both, I
don't think we should go for it.

&gt;<i> The alternative approach, which andytoshi and I came up with
</I>&gt;<i> independently is a lot more complicated:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   revealP( Q, R, sigA, sigB, sigC ) {
</I>&gt;<i>     check_multisig_verify(2, P, R, 2, sigA, sigB); code_separtor();
</I>&gt;<i>     check_multisig_verify(2, Q, R, 2, sigA, sigC); code_separtor();
</I>&gt;<i>     check_multisig_verify(2, P, Q, 2, sigC, sigB);
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If sigA, sigB and sigC all share the same r and SIGHASH settings,
</I>
I don't think this works?  We can't provide the signatures in the
scriptPubkey, since that requires them signing themselves.  We can't
have them provide it in the scriptSig, since theres no &quot;do these have
the same r value&quot; operator in script.  All those ops got disabled :(

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Assume two keypairs, K1(Q, q) and K2(R, r). Further we have a scalar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; p, such that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; r = p * q
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; R = r * G = ( p * q ) * G = p * ( q * G ) = p * Q.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greg Maxwell also pointed out you can also do this faster while still
</I>&gt;<i> being secure; assuming Q was the public key from the incoming HTLC, and P
</I>&gt;<i> is the public key you'll use for the outgoing HTLC, and r is your secret:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  p = q + r
</I>&gt;<i>  P = (q+r)*G = q*G + r*G = Q + r*G
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given Q is already known, calculating P just requires multiplying the
</I>&gt;<i> base point and an addition, which is quicker than multiplying an arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> point. And once you find out p, calculating q=p-r is obviously easy.
</I>
Yes, this is a nice optimization.

Cheers,
Rusty.
