Sure, but maybe you've got lightning funds already?

Let's continue your analysis.  We already know the protocol can be
extended to pay to anything (what I have been calling &quot;Atomic swap to
X&quot;).

The general problem with swapping onto the blockchain is that it needs
to be able to time out, since the basic deal is of form &quot;I will pay you
$5 iff you give me R in the next 24 hours&quot;.  That can't be done natively
in script, but it can be done as follows:

First create a tx with a small output with scriptPubkey of form &quot;pay to
me, or after &lt;timeout&gt; pay to anyone&quot;.  Use that as one input to your
crowdfunding tx.

After the timeout, anyone can double-spend and thus invalidate the
crowdfunding tx (make the amount cover a the expected txfee, and it's
free money).

Cheers,
Rusty.
