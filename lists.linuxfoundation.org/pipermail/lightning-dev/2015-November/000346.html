</I>&gt;<i>   P -- the commitment tx is published at time P
</I>&gt;<i>   S -- the commitment tx is spent at time S

</I>...
&gt;<i>    For n=4, F=4, t &gt;= d+2 hours, so normal expiry is no later than

</I>
Is the 2 hours here due to timer tolerance?  If so, BIP 113 may allow us
to squeeze that a little in practice, depending on one's risk tolerance.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, worst case is 3 days unless there are multiple hop failures?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A single hop failure at node 3 immediately after the transaction gets
</I>&gt;<i> passed on would be worse. Setup:
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think about reducing the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY argument if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's followed by the revocation delay?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The revocation delay happens simultaneously, so I don't think this can
</I>&gt;<i> be made to work usefully.
</I>
Good point, it was a thinko.

&gt;<i> Don't think it's needed either though, so long as channels have parameters
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; as well as &quot;d&quot; to drop to the blockchain well before T
</I>&gt;<i> actually comes around.
</I>
I'll be honest, I got lost somewhere in the alphabet reading your post.

However, you might be able to help me with a related question: I
proposed previously that if you didn't get fast resolution on an HTLC
you'd require proof that a commit tx was published, or you'd close the
channel yourself to create such a proof to hand back.

How would this work, timeout-wise?  We don't know how many hops are
ahead of us.  If the rule is &quot;wait 1 minute, if you don't get a
response, close the channel&quot; then everyone in the chain will close the
channel at once.  If the timeout is in the HTLC offer, then it makes the
message more traceable.

I can't see any obvious solution, can you?

Thanks,
Rusty.
