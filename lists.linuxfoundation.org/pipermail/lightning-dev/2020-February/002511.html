<PRE>Good Morning Cezary,

you might want to direct questions about understanding the lightning
network protocol like yours to <A HREF="https://bitcoin.stackexchanage.com">https://bitcoin.stackexchanage.com</A> as this
mailinglist is more devoted towards driving the development of the
protocol. Anyway here are the answers to your questions 2 and 3 and
probably also to the first one though I am not entirely sure if I
understand exactly what you are asking for. In case I misunderstood you
suggest to put follow up questions on stackexchange.

1. Is this possible that by sending funds without invoice, the last hub
&gt;<i> prepares the last HTLC with small amount to the payee? In other words - Can
</I>&gt;<i> payee detect, that the last HTLC amount is smaller that it should be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But in general the payee will only release the preimage for an invoice if
the payee is satisfied with the amount - which is usually specified in the
invoice. If you talk about keysend then the payee does not expect an amount
and will most likely release the preimage as the payee would consider this
to be free money


&gt;<i> 2. Are there additional data added to the end of onion encrypted list of
</I>&gt;<i> HTLCs in order to prevent last hub to guess, that it is the last hub in the
</I>&gt;<i> route?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes the onions are always of constant size (20 * 65 Byte = 1300 Byte) This
process of padding is well described in the Sphinx paper
<A HREF="https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf">https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf</A> and in BOLT 04
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md</A>

3. When payment is during confirmation, are channels locked entirely, or
&gt;<i> only for the in flight payment amount? In other words - can single channel
</I>&gt;<i> process more that single transaction at once?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
HTLCs are additional outputs in the commitment transaction. The protocol
allows for up to 483 htlcs concurrently in flight as specified in BOLT 04 (&quot;
max_accepted_htlcs is limited to 483 to ensure that, even if both sides
send the maximum number of HTLCs, the commitment_signed message will still
be under the maximum message size. It also ensures that a single penalty
transaction can spend the entire commitment transaction, as calculated in BOLT
#5
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/05-onchain.md#penalty-transaction-weight-calculation">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/05-onchain.md#penalty-transaction-weight-calculation</A>&gt;
.&quot;)

However the the standard of implementations and recommendation is 30. This
means that a single payment is not freezing the channel. It however &quot;locks&quot;
the amount of that payment which for the time until settlement cannot be
used by either party of the channel for other payments / activities.

with kind regards Rene


&gt;<i> I would like to kindly pleas to reply in simple words, as my English is
</I>&gt;<i> still far from being perfect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Cezary Dziemian
