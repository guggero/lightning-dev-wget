</I>
Yes, it needs to scale with distance to work at all.  However, it has
the same problems with other upfront schemes: how does E know to send
4msat per minute?

&gt;<i> I think it might make sense for the payments to have a grace period --
</I>&gt;<i> ie, &quot;if you keep this payment open longer than 20 seconds, you have to
</I>&gt;<i> start paying me x msat/minute, but if it fulfills or cancels before
</I>&gt;<i> then, it's all good&quot;.
</I>
But whatever the grace period, I can just rely on knowing that B is in
Australia (with a 1 second HTLC commit time) to make that node bleed
satoshis.  I can send A-&gt;B-&gt;C, and have C fail the htlc after 19
seconds for free.  But B has to send 1msat to A.  B can't blame A or C,
since this attack could come from further away, too.

This attack always seems possible.  Are you supposed to pay immediately
to fail an HTLC?  That makes for a trivial attack, so I guess not.

And if there is a grace period, I can just gum up the network with lots
of slow-but-not-slow-enough HTLCs.

&gt;<i> Maybe this also implies a different protocol for HTLC forwarding,
</I>&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1. A sends the HTLC onion packet to B
</I>&gt;<i>   2. B decrypts it, makes sure it makes sense
</I>&gt;<i>   3. B sends a half-signed updated channel state back to A
</I>&gt;<i>   4. A accepts it, and forwards the other half-signed channel update to B
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so that at any point before (4) Alice can say &quot;this is taking too long,
</I>&gt;<i> I'll start losing money&quot; and safely abort the HTLC she was forwarding to
</I>&gt;<i> Bob to avoid paying fees; while only after (4) can she start the time on
</I>&gt;<i> expecting Bob to start paying fees that she'll forward back. That means
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5 round-trips before Bob can really forward the HTLC on to Carol;
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe it's parallelisable, so Bob/Carol could start at (1) as soon
</I>&gt;<i> as Alice/Bob has finished (2).
</I>
We added a ping-before-commit[1] to avoid the case where B has disconnected
and we don't know yet; we have to assume an HTLC is stuck once we send
commitment_signed.  This would be a formalization of that, but I don't
think it's any better?

There's an old proposal to fast-fail HTLCs: Bob sends an new message &quot;I
would fail this HTLC once it's committed, here's the error&quot; and if Alice
gets it before she sends the commitment_signed, she sends a new
&quot;unadd_htlc&quot; message first.  This theoretically allows Bob to do the
same: optimistically forward it, and unadd it if Alice doesn't commit
with it in time.[2]

Cheers,
Rusty.

[1] Technically, if we haven't seen any traffic from the peer in the
    last 30 seconds, we send a ping and wait.

[2] This seems like a speedup, but it only is if someone fails the HTLC.
    We still need to send the commitment_signed back and forth (w/
    revoke and ack) before committing to it in the next hop.
