<PRE>Good morning Joost and aj,

A thought that arises here is, what happens if I have forwarded a payment, then the outgoing channel is dropped onchain and that peer disconnects from me?

Since the onchain HTLC might have a timelock of, say, a few hundred blocks from now, the outgoing peer can claim it up until the timelock.
If the peer does not claim it, I cannot claim it in my incoming as well.
I also cannot safely fail my incoming, as the outgoing peer can still claim it until the timelock expires.

Am I liable for paying the encumbrance fee in this situation?
How do I charge the next node the encumbrance fee myself if it has dropped the channel onchain and disconnected from me?

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attack there is also an attacker node at the end of the route. The attacker
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still pays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this makes a lot of sense. I think the way it would end up working
</I>&gt;<i> is that the further the route extends, the greater the payments are, so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A -&gt; B : B sends A 1msat per minute
</I>&gt;<i> A -&gt; B -&gt; C : C sends B 2msat per minute, B forwards 1msat/min to A
</I>&gt;<i> A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D : D sends C 3 msat, etc
</I>&gt;<i> A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E : E sends D 4 msat, etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so each node is receiving +1 msat/minute, except for the last one, who's
</I>&gt;<i> paying n msat/minute, where n is the number of hops to have gotten up to
</I>&gt;<i> the last one. There's the obvious privacy issue there, with fairly
</I>&gt;<i> obvious ways to fudge around it, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that's rational, because that last node can either (a) collect the
</I>&gt;<i> payment, covering their cost; or (b) forward the payment, at which point
</I>&gt;<i> they'll start collecting funds rather than paying them; or (c) cancel
</I>&gt;<i> the payment releasing all the locked up funds all the way back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it might make sense for the payments to have a grace period --
</I>&gt;<i> ie, &quot;if you keep this payment open longer than 20 seconds, you have to
</I>&gt;<i> start paying me x msat/minute, but if it fulfills or cancels before
</I>&gt;<i> then, it's all good&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if there needs to be any enforcement for this beyond &quot;this
</I>&gt;<i> peer isn't obeying the protocol, so I'm going to close the channel&quot;; not
</I>&gt;<i> even sure it's something that needs to be negotiated as part of payment
</I>&gt;<i> routing -- it could just be something each peer does for HTLCs on their
</I>&gt;<i> channels? If that can be made to work, it doesn't need much crypto or
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoin consensus changes, or even much deployment coordination, all of
</I>&gt;<i> which would be awesome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think at $10k/BTC then 1msat is about the fair price for locking up $5
</I>&gt;<i> worth of BTC (so 50k sat) for 1 minute at a 1% pa interest rate, fwiw.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this opens up some sort of an attack where a peer lies about the
</I>&gt;<i> time to make the &quot;per minute&quot; go faster, but if msats-per-minute is the
</I>&gt;<i> units, not sure that really matters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this also implies a different protocol for HTLC forwarding,
</I>&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  A sends the HTLC onion packet to B
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  B decrypts it, makes sure it makes sense
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  B sends a half-signed updated channel state back to A
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  A accepts it, and forwards the other half-signed channel update to B
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     so that at any point before (4) Alice can say &quot;this is taking too long,
</I>&gt;<i>     I'll start losing money&quot; and safely abort the HTLC she was forwarding to
</I>&gt;<i>     Bob to avoid paying fees; while only after (4) can she start the time on
</I>&gt;<i>     expecting Bob to start paying fees that she'll forward back. That means
</I>&gt;<i>     1.5 round-trips before Bob can really forward the HTLC on to Carol;
</I>&gt;<i>     but maybe it's parallelisable, so Bob/Carol could start at (1) as soon
</I>&gt;<i>     as Alice/Bob has finished (2).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers
