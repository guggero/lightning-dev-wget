Yes, you need to PoDLE your own contribution I think, which means you
need one UTXO per contributor in the N-way-open who you want to
contribute a UTXO.

Consider Alice trying to create a single-tx to open a channel with both
Bob and Carol, and wants *both* of them to also contribute.

Alice sends her own UTXO1 with proof to Bob, he shares his UTXO back.
Alice sends her own UTXO2 with proof to Carol, she shares a UTXO back.
Alice sets the lower bit on the serial_id from Bob and sends to Carol,
and sets the lower on the serial_id from Carol and sends to Bob.  She
similarly reflects everything from Carol to Bob and vice-versa, and
sends both of them the two &quot;channel opening&quot; outputs.

Now all parties have the same tx; unless Bob and Carol chose the same
serial_ids (spec says random, but Bob and Carol don't get along).  But
this is trivially identifiable, and you give up on mutual opening.

Cheers,
Rusty.
