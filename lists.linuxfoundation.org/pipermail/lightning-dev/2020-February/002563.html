</I>&gt;<i> limitation?
</I>
But the comparison here is not with the current state, but with the
&quot;best previous proposal we have&quot;, which is:

1. Charge an up-front fee for accepting any HTLC.
2. Will hang-up after grace period unless you either prove a channel
   close, or gain another grace period by decrypting onion.

(There was is an obvious extension to this, where you pay another HTLC
first which covers the (larger) up-front fee for the &quot;I know the next
HTLC is going to take a long time&quot;).

That proposal is simpler, and covers this case quite nicely.

&gt;<i> at which point the best B can do is unilaterally close the B/C channel
</I>&gt;<i> with their pre-HTLC commitment, but they still have to wait for that to
</I>&gt;<i> confirm before they can safely cancel the HTLC with A, and that will
</I>&gt;<i> likely take more than whatever the grace period is, so B will be losing
</I>&gt;<i> money on holding fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whereas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   A-&gt;B: here's a HTLC, locked in
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   B-&gt;C: HTLC proposal
</I>&gt;<i>   C-&gt;B: sure: updated commitment with HTLC locked in
</I>&gt;<i>   B-&gt;C: great, corresponding updated commitment, plus revocation
</I>&gt;<i>   C-&gt;B: revocation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> means that if C goes silent before B receives a new commitment, B can
</I>&gt;<i> cancel the HTLC with A with no risk (B can publish the old commitment
</I>&gt;<i> still even if the new arrives later, and C can only publish the pre-HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> commitment), and if C goes silent after B receives the new commitment, B
</I>&gt;<i> can drop the new commitment to the blockchain and pay A's fees out of it.
</I>
Interesting; this adds a trip, but not in latency (since C can still
count on the HTLC being locked in at step 3).

I don't see how it helps B though?  It still ends up paying A, and C
doesn't pay anything?

It forces a liveness check of C, but TBH I dread rewriting the state
machine for this when we can just ping like we do now.

&gt;&gt;<i> There's an old proposal to fast-fail HTLCs: Bob sends an new message &quot;I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would fail this HTLC once it's committed, here's the error&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, you could do &quot;B-&gt;C: proposal, C-&gt;B: no way!&quot; instead of &quot;sure&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> fast fail the above too. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I think something like that's necessary (at least with my view of how
</I>&gt;<i> this &quot;keep the HTLC open&quot; payment would work), otherwise B could send C a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;1 microsecond grace period, rate of 3e11 msat/minute, HTLC for 100 sat,
</I>&gt;<i> timeout of 2016 blocks&quot; and if C couldn't reject it immediately would
</I>&gt;<i> owe B 50c per millisecond it took to cancel.
</I>
Well, surely grace period (and penalty rate) are either fixed in the
protocol or negotiated up-front, not per-HTLC.

Cheers,
Rusty.
