<PRE>I'm a bit confused, I don't know if the implementation work you're
mentioning refers to my proposal
or yours :).

When you say `temporary id`, could you clarify whether you mean a temporary
`node_id` or `scid`?

Firstly, need to brute-force the onion against your N keys.


This is probably the part that confuses me. Are you talking about Bob or
Alice there?
Alice can easily have her `decoy_node_id` be derived from her real
`node_id`'s privacy key and the
`payment_hash` or `payment_preimage`. When she receives a payment, she
knows which `decoy_node_id`
should have been used so she doesn't need to brute-force.

That means Alice doesn't even have to change how she stores invoices. When
Alice retrieves the
invoice from her DB, if it has the `decoy_node_id` feature bit set, she
knows she needs to derive
the correct `node_id`. If it doesn't have that feature bit set, it's a
&quot;legacy&quot; invoice and she has
to use her real `node_id`.

Now Mallory uses Bob-&gt;C2 to pay to N1 for Inv1. If it works, he knows it's
&gt;<i> the same node issuing both invoices.
</I>

Same, that wouldn't work because Alice can easily detect the mismatch and
pretend she can't decrypt
the onion (the code doesn't even have to pretend: it will use the expected
`node_id` and use the
existing error paths).

Actually, that was too hasty.


Ok I think your second email came to the same conclusions and clarifies it
a bit :).

It's true that this is code where the developer may easily get confused
between keys (but it's a
lot simpler than the Sphinx or Noise implementation).

However in my opinion it's still simpler than the `scid` state management
that needs to happen at
Alice and Bob in <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/681">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/681</A>
(but I would need to
implement both E2E to be able to fairly judge that).

Thanks for the feedback, I'll keep working on improving the proposal.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That's of course a solution as well. Even with that though, if Alice
</I>opens
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; multiple channels to each of her Bobs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; she should use Tor and a different node_id each time for better
</I>privacy.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are two uses for this feature (both of which I started
</I>implementing):
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Simply always use a temporary id when you have a private channel, to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    obscure your onchain footprint.  This is a nobrainer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. For an extra layer of transience, apply a new temporary id and new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    nodeid on every invoice *which applies only for that invoice*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But implementing the latter securely is fraught!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Firstly, need to brute-force the onion against your N keys.  Secondly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you use a temporary key, then you *don't* end up using the HTLC to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pay an invoice matching that key, you *MUST* pretend you couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decrypt the onion!  This applies to all code paths between the two,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including parsing the TLV, etc: they must ALL return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WIRE_INVALID_ONION_HMAC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise, Mallory can get an invoice, then send malformed payments to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alice using the transient key in the invoice and see if she decrypts it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, that was too hasty.  You can use the payment_hash as a
</I>&gt;<i> fastpath:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Look up invoice using payment_hash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If there is an invoice, and it has a temporary id associated with it,
</I>&gt;<i>    try using that to decrypt the onion.  If that works, and the onion is
</I>&gt;<i>    on the final hop, and the TLV decodes, and the payment_secret is
</I>&gt;<i>    correct, you can go back and use this temporary key to decrypt the
</I>onion.
&gt;<i>    Otherwise, go back and use the normal node key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's still quite a bit of tricky code though...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
