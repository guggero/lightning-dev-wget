<PRE>Hi all!

        It seems that messaging over lightning is A Thing, and I want to
use it for the offers protocol anyway.  So I've come up with the
simplest proposal I can, and even implemented it.

        Importantly, it's unreliable.  Our implementation doesn't
remember across restarts, limits us to 1000 total remembered forwards
with random drop, and the protocol doesn't (yet?) include a method for
errors.

        This is much friendlier on nodes than using an HTLC (which
requires 2 round trips, signature calculations and db commits), so is an
obvious candidate for much more than just invoice requests.

        The WIP patch is small enough I've pasted it below, but it's
also at <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/748">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/748</A>

+# Directed Messages
+
+Directed messages allow peers to use existing connections to query for
+invoices (see [BOLT 12](12-offer-encoding.md)).  Like gossip messages,
+they are not associated with a particular local channel.  Like HTLCs,
+they use [BOLT 4](04-onion-routing.md#directed-messages) protocol for
+end-to-end encryption.
+
+Directed messages are unreliable: in particular, they are designed to
+be cheap and not to need to be committed to a database (though an
+implementation may choose to).  Each one has an optional reply, which
+is [onion encoded](04-onion-routing.md#directed-message-replies) 0just
