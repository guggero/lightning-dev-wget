</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was either way too simple or is gameable by rational players.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In lightning we have a trivial solution to this - your wallet vendor/LSP is already extracting a fee

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> larger nodes its (obviously, and trivially) not a problem either, which leaves the &quot;middle nodes&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stranded without good data but without an LSP they want to use for data. I believe that isn't a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large enough cohort to change the whole network around for, and them asking a few altruistic (let's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say, developer?) nodes for scoring data seems more than sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this is all ultimately hearsay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> LSPs can be bought out, and developers can go rogue.
</I>&gt;<i> Neither should be trusted if at all possible.
</I>
You're missing the point - if your LSP wants to &quot;go rogue&quot; here, at worst they can charge you more 
fees. They could also do this by...charging you more fees. I'm not really sure what your concern is.

&gt;<i> Which is why I think forwardable peerswaps fixes this: it *creates* paths that allow payment routing, without requiring pervasive monitoring (which is horrible because eventually the network will be large enough that you will never encounter the same node twice if you're a plebeian, and if you're an aristocrat, you have every incentive to lie to the plebeians to solidify your power) of the network.
</I>
No, this is much, much worse for the network. In order to do this &quot;live&quot; (i.e. without failing a 
payment) you have to establish trust relationships across the network (i.e. make giving your peers 
credit a requirement to be considered a &quot;robust node&quot; and, thus, receive fee revenue).

Doing splicing/peerswap as a better way to rebalance is, of course, awesome, but it doesn't solve 
the issue of &quot;what do I do if I'm just too low on capacity *right now* to clear this HTLC&quot;.
