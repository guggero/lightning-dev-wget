Define &quot;in time&quot; in a way that results in senders not punishing you for not meeting your &quot;HA 
guarantees&quot; due to a large flow. I don't buy that this results in anything other than pressure to 
add credit.

Right, that was my above point about fetching scoring data - there's three relevant &quot;buckets&quot; of 
nodes, I think - (a) large nodes sending lots of payments, like the above, (b) &quot;client nodes&quot; that 
just connect to an LSP or two, (c) nodes that route some but don't send a lot of payments (but do 
send *some* payments), and may have lots or not very many channels.

(a) I think we're getting there, and we don't need to add anything extra for this use-case beyond 
the network maturing and improving our scoring algorithms.
(b) I think is trivially solved by downloading the data from a node in category (a), presumably the 
LSP(s) in question (see other branch of this thread)
(c) is trickier, but I think the same solution of just fetching semi-trusted data here more than 
sufficies. For most routing nodes that don't send a lot of payments we're talking about a very small 
amount of payments, so trusting a third-party for scoring data seems reasonable.

Once we do that, everyone gets a similar experience as the River report :).
