<PRE>Hi Matt,

If nodes start aggressively preferring routes through nodes that reliably
&gt;<i> route payments (which I believe lnd already does, in effect, to some large
</I>&gt;<i> extent), they should do so by measurement, not signaling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The signaling is intended as a way to make measurement more efficient. If a
node signals that a particular channel is HA and it fails, no other
measurements on that same node need to be taken by the sender. They can
skip the node altogether for a longer period of time.


&gt;<i> In practice, many channels on the network are &#8220;high availability&#8221; today,
</I>&gt;<i> but only in one direction (I.e. they aren&#8217;t regularly spliced/rebalanced
</I>&gt;<i> and are regularly unbalanced). A node strongly preferring a high payment
</I>&gt;<i> success rate *should* prefer such a channel, but in your scheme would not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This shouldn't be a problem, because the HA signaling is also directional.
Each end can decide independently on whether to add the flag for a
particular channel.


&gt;<i> This ignores the myriad of &#8220;at what threshold do you signal HA&#8221; issues,
</I>&gt;<i> which likely make such a signal DOA, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think this is a product of sender preference for HA channels and the
severity of the penalty if an HA channel fails. Given this, routing nodes
will need to decide whether they can offer a service level that increases
their routing revenue overall if they would signal HA. It is indeed
dynamic, but I think the market is able to work it out.


&gt;<i> Finally, I&#8217;m very dismayed at this direction in thinking on how ln should
</I>&gt;<i> work - nodes should be measuring the network and routing over paths that it
</I>&gt;<i> thinks are reliable for what it wants, *robustly over an unreliable
</I>&gt;<i> network*. We should absolutely not be expecting the lightning network to be
</I>&gt;<i> built out of high reliability nodes, that creates strong centralization
</I>&gt;<i> pressure. To truly meet a &#8220;high availability&#8221; threshold, realistically,
</I>&gt;<i> you&#8217;d need to be able to JIT 0conf splice-in, which would drive lightning
</I>&gt;<i> to actually being a credit network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Different people can have different opinions about how ln should work, that
is fine. I see a trade-off between the reliability of the network and the
barrier of entry, and I don't think the optimum is on one of the ends of
the scale.


&gt;<i> With reasonable volume, lightning today is very reliable and relatively
</I>&gt;<i> fast, with few retries required. I don&#8217;t think we need to change anything
</I>&gt;<i> to fix it. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How can you be sure about this? This isn't publicly visible data.
