<PRE>Hi Joost,

&gt;<i> For a long time I've held the expectation that eventually payers on the
</I>lightning network will become very strict about node performance. That they
will &gt; require a routing node to operate flawlessly or else apply a hefty
penalty such as completely avoiding the node for an extended period of time
- multiple &gt; weeks. The consequence of this is that routing nodes would
need to manage their liquidity meticulously because every failure
potentially has a large
&gt;<i> impact on future routing revenue.
</I>
I think the performance question depends on the type of payment flows
considered. If you're an
end-user sending a payment to your local Starbucks for coffee, here fast
payment sounds the end-goal.
If you're doing remittance payment, cheap fees might be favored, and in
function of those flows you're
probably not going to select the same &quot;performant&quot; routing nodes. I think
adding latency as a criteria for
pathfinding construction has already been mentioned in the past for LDK [0].

&gt;<i> I think movement in this direction is important to guarantee
</I>competitiveness with centralised payment systems and their (at least
theoretical) ability to
&gt;<i> process a payment in the blink of an eye. A lightning wallet trying
</I>multiple paths to find one that works doesn't help with this.

Or there is the direction to build forward-error-correction code on top of
MPP, like in traditional
networking [1]. The rough idea, you send more payment shards than the
requested sum, and then
you reveal the payment secrets to the receiver after an onion interactivity
round to finalize payment.

&gt;<i> A common argument against strict penalisation is that it would lead to
</I>less efficient use of capital. Routing nodes would need to maintain pools of
&gt;<i> liquidity to guarantee successes all the time. My opinion on this is that
</I>lightning is already enormously capital efficient at scale and that it is
worth
&gt;<i> sacrificing a slight part of that efficiency to also achieve the lowest
</I>possible latency.

At the end of the day, we add more signal channels between HTLC senders and
the routing
nodes offering capital liquidity, if the signal mechanisms are efficient, I
think they should lead
to better allocation of the capital. So yes, I think more liquidity might
be used by routing nodes
to serve finely tailored HTLC requests by senders, however this liquidity
should be rewarded
by higher routing fees.

&gt;<i> This brings me to the actual subject of this post. Assuming strict
</I>penalisation is good, it may still not be ideal to flip the switch from one
day to the other. &gt; Routing nodes may not offer the required level of
service yet, causing senders to end up with no nodes to choose from.

&gt;<i> One option is to gradually increase the strength of the penalties, so
</I>that routing nodes are given time to adapt to the new standards. This does
require &gt; everyone to move along and leaves no space for cheap routing
nodes with less leeway in terms of liquidity.

I think if we have lessons to learn on policy rules design and deployment
on the base-layer
(the full-rbf saga), it's to be careful in the initial set of rules, and
how we ensure smooth
upgradeability, from one version to another. Otherwise the re-deployment
cost towards
the new version might incentive the old routing node to stay on the
non-optimal versions,
and as we have historical buckets in routing algorithms, or preference for
older channels,
this might lead the end-user to pay higher fees, than they could access to.

&gt;<i> Therefore I am proposing another way to go about it: extend the
</I>`channel_update` field `channel_flags` with a new bit that the sender can
use to signal &gt; `highly_available`.

&gt;<i> It's then up to payers to decide how to interpret this flag. One way
</I>could be to prefer `highly_available` channels during pathfinding. But if
the routing
&gt;<i> node then returns a failure, a much stronger than normal penalty will be
</I>applied. For routing nodes this creates an opportunity to attract more
traffic by &gt; marking some channels as `highly_available`, but it also comes
with the responsibility to deliver.

This is where the open question lies to me - &quot;highly available&quot; can be
defined with multiple
senses, like fault-tolerance, latency processing, equilibrated liquidity.
And a routing node might
not be able to optimize its architecture for the same end-goal (e.g more
watchtower on remote
host probably increases the latency processing).

&gt;<i> Without shadow channels, it is impossible to guarantee liquidity up to
</I>the channel capacity. It might make sense for senders to only assume high
&gt;<i> availability for amounts up to `htlc_maximum_msat`.
</I>
As a note, I think &quot;senders assumption&quot; should be well-documented,
otherwise there will be
performance discrepancies between node implementations or even versions.
E.g, an upgraded
sender penalizing a node for the lack of shadow/parallel channels
fulfilling HTLC amounts up to
`htlc_maximum_msat`.

&gt;<i> A variation on this scheme that requires no extension of `channel_update`
</I>is to signal availability implicitly through routing fees. So the more
expensive &gt; a channel is, the stronger the penalty that is applied on
failure will be. It seems less ideal though, because it
could disincentivize cheap but reliable
&gt;<i> channels on high traffic links.
</I>
&gt;<i> The effort required to implement some form of a `highly_available` flag
</I>seem limited and it may help to get payment success rates up. Interested to
&gt;<i> hear your thoughts.
</I>
I think signal availability should be explicit rather than implicit. Even
if it's coming with more
gossip bandwidth data consumed. I would say for bandwidth performance
management, relying
on new gossip messages, where they can be filtered in function of the level
of services required
is interesting.

Best,
Antoine
