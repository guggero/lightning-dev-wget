Ah, thank you for bringing this up! I'd thought about it and then forgot to mention it in this thread.

I think this is very important to highlight as we talk about &quot;building a reliable lightning network 
out of unreliable nodes&quot; - this is an *incredibly* powerful feature for this.

While its much less capital-effecient, the ability to over-commit upfront and then only allow the 
recipient to claim a portion of the total committed funds would substantially reduce the impact of 
failed HTLCs on payment latency. Of course the extra round-trip to request the &quot;unlock keys&quot; for the 
correct set of HTLCs adds a chunk to total latency, so senders will have to be careful about 
deciding when to do this or not.

Still, now that we have onion messages, we should do (well, try) this! Its not super complicated to 
implement (like everything it seems, the obvious implementation forgoes proof-of-payment, and like 
everything the obvious solution is PTLCs, I think). Its not clear to me how we get good data from 
trials, though, we'd need a sufficient set of the network to support this that we could actually 
test it, which is hard to get for a test.

Maybe someone (anyone?) wants to do some experiments doing simulations using real probing success 
rates to figure out how successful this would be and propose a concrete sender strategy that would 
improve success rates.
