Kind of.  I mean, we can add a &quot;update_noop&quot; message which simply
requests your turn and has no other effects.

&gt;&gt;<i> The only &quot;twist&quot; is that if it's your turn and you receive an update,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can either reply with a &quot;yield&quot; message, or ignore it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you handle the &quot;no changes to make&quot; case - do you send yields back and forth ever Nms all day long or is there 
</I>&gt;<i> some protocol by which you resolve it when both parties try to claim turn at once?
</I>
You don't do anything?

If you want to send an update:
1. If it is your turn, send it.
2. If it is not your turn, send it and wait for either a `yield`, or a
   different update.  In the former case, it's now your turn, in the
   latter case it's not and your update was ignored.

If you receive an update when it's your turn:
1. If you've sent an update already, ignore it.
2. Otherwise, send `yield`.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Isn&#8217;t that pretty similar? Discard one splice proposal deterministically (ok that&#8217;s new) and the loser has to store their proposal in a holding cell for later (which they have to do in turn-based anyway). Logic to check if there&#8217;s unsettled things in RAA handling is pretty similar to turn-based, and logic to reject other messages is the same as shutdown handling today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nope, with the simplified protocol you can `update_splice` at any time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of your normal update, since both sides are already in sync.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I'm somewhat failing to understand why its that different - you can only update_splice if its your turn, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> about exactly the same amount of additional logic to check turn conditions as just flag &quot;want to do splice&quot;. Either way 
</I>&gt;<i> you have the same pending splice buffer.
</I>
No, for turn-taking, this case is exactly like any other update.

For non-turn taking, we need an explicit quiescence protocol, and to
handle simultanous splicing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - MUST use the higher of the two `funding_feerate_perkw` as the feerate for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   the splice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If we like turn based, why not just deterministic throw out one slice? :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because while I am going to implement turn-based, I'm not sure if anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else is.  I guess we'll see?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My point was more that its similar in logic - if you throw out the splice deterministically and just keep it in some 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pending slice&quot; buffer on the sending side, you've just done basically what you'd do to implement turns, while keeping 
</I>&gt;<i> the non-turn slice protocol a bit easier :).
</I>
No, you really haven't.  Right now you can have Alice propose a splice
while Bob proposes at the same time, so we have a tiebreak protocol.
And you can have Alice propose a splice while Bob proposes a different
update which needs to be completely resolved before the splice can
continue.

Whereas in turn taking, when someone proposes a splice, that's what
you're doing, as soon as it is received.  And when someone wants to
propose a splice, they can do it as soon as it's their turn.  If it's
not their turn and the other side proposes a splice, they can jump onto
that (happy days, since the splice proposer pays for 1 input 1 output
and the core of the tx!).

Cheers,
Rusty.
