<PRE>Do you have any back-of-the-napkin math on quantifying how much this would
improve the situation vs existing methods (eg cpfp)?

&gt;<i> Happy new years devs,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I figured I would share some thoughts for conceptual review that have been
</I>&gt;<i> bouncing around my head as an opportunity to clean up the fee paying
</I>&gt;<i> semantics in bitcoin &quot;for good&quot;. The design space is very wide on the
</I>&gt;<i> approach I'll share, so below is just a sketch of how it could work which
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure could be improved greatly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transaction fees are an integral part of bitcoin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, due to quirks of Bitcoin's transaction design, fees are a part of
</I>&gt;<i> the transactions that they occur in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While this works in a &quot;Bitcoin 1.0&quot; world, where all transactions are
</I>&gt;<i> simple on-chain transfers, real world use of Bitcoin requires support for
</I>&gt;<i> things like Fee Bumping stuck transactions, DoS resistant Payment Channels,
</I>&gt;<i> and other long lived Smart Contracts that can't predict future fee rates.
</I>&gt;<i> Having the fees paid in band makes writing these contracts much more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult as you can't merely express the logic you want for the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, but also the fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Previously, I proposed a special type of transaction called a &quot;Sponsor&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which has some special consensus + mempool rules to allow arbitrarily
</I>&gt;<i> appending fees to a transaction to bump it up in the mempool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an alternative, we could establish an account system in Bitcoin as an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;extension block&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Here's how it might work:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Define a special anyone can spend output type that is a &quot;fee account&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. segwit V2). Such outputs have a redeeming key and an amount
</I>&gt;<i> associated with them, but are overall anyone can spend.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. All deposits to these outputs get stored in a separate UTXO database
</I>&gt;<i> for fee accounts
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Fee accounts can sign only two kinds of transaction: A: a fee amount
</I>&gt;<i> and a TXID (or Outpoint?); B: a withdraw amount, a fee, and an address
</I>&gt;<i> 4. These transactions are committed in an extension block merkle tree.
</I>&gt;<i> While the actual signature must cover the TXID/Outpoint, the committed data
</I>&gt;<i> need only cover the index in the block of the transaction. The public key
</I>&gt;<i> for account lookup can be recovered from the message + signature.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. In any block, any of the fee account deposits can be: released into
</I>&gt;<i> fees if there is a corresponding tx; consolidated together to reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> number of utxos (this can be just an OP_TRUE no metadata needed); or
</I>&gt;<i> released into fees *and paid back* into the requested withdrawal key
</I>&gt;<i> (encumbering a 100 block timeout). Signatures must be unique in a block.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Mempool logic is updated to allow attaching of account fee spends to
</I>&gt;<i> transactions, the mempool can restrict that an account is not allowed more
</I>&gt;<i> spend more than it's balance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *But aren't accounts &quot;bad&quot;?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, accounts are bad. But these accounts are not bad, because any funds
</I>&gt;<i> withdrawn from the fee extension are fundamentally locked for 100 blocks as
</I>&gt;<i> a coinbase output, so there should be no issues with any series of reorgs.
</I>&gt;<i> Further, since there is no &quot;rich state&quot; for these accounts, the state
</I>&gt;<i> updates can always be applied in a conflict-free way in any order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Improving the privacy of this design:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This design could likely be modified to implement something like
</I>&gt;<i> Tornado.cash or something else so that the fee account paying can be
</I>&gt;<i> unlinked from the transaction being paid for, improving privacy at the
</I>&gt;<i> expense of being a bit more expensive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other operations could be added to allow a trustless mixing to be done by
</I>&gt;<i> miners automatically where groups of accounts with similar values are
</I>&gt;<i> trustlessly  split into a common denominator and change, and keys are
</I>&gt;<i> derived via a verifiable stealth address like protocol (so fee balances can
</I>&gt;<i> be discovered by tracing the updates posted). These updates could also be
</I>&gt;<i> produced by individuals rather than miners, and miners could simply honor
</I>&gt;<i> them with better privacy. While a miner generating an update would be able
</I>&gt;<i> to deanonymize their mixes, if you have your account mixed several times by
</I>&gt;<i> independent miners that could potentially add sufficient privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The LN can also be used with PTLCs to, in theory, have another individual
</I>&gt;<i> paid to sponsor a transaction on your behalf only if they reveal a valid
</I>&gt;<i> sig from their fee paying account, although under this model it's hard to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that the owner doesn't pay a fee and then 'cancel' by withdrawing
</I>&gt;<i> the rest. However, this could be partly solved by using reputable fee
</I>&gt;<i> accounts (reputation could be measured somewhat decentralized-ly by
</I>&gt;<i> longevity of the account and transactions paid for historically).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Scalability*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This design is fundamentally 'decent' for scalability because adding fees
</I>&gt;<i> to a transaction does not require adding inputs or outputs and does not
</I>&gt;<i> require tracking substantial amounts of new state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paying someone else to pay for you via the LN also helps make this more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient if the withdrawal issues can be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Lightning:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This type of design works really well for channels because the addition of
</I>&gt;<i> fees to e.g. a channel state does not require any sort of pre-planning
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. anchors) or transaction flexibility (SIGHASH flags). This sort of
</I>&gt;<i> design is naturally immune to pinning issues since you could offer to pay a
</I>&gt;<i> fee for any TXID and the number of fee adding offers does not need to be
</I>&gt;<i> restricted in the same way the descendant transactions would need to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Without a fork?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This type of design could be done as a federated network that bribes
</I>&gt;<i> miners -- potentially even retroactively after a block is formed. That
</I>&gt;<i> might be sufficient to prove the concept works before a consensus upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> is deployed, but such an approach does mean there is a centralizing layer
</I>&gt;<i> interfering with normal mining.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Happy new year!!
