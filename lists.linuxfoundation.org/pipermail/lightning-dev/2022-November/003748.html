<PRE>Hi,

I agree that the local reputation solution is very promising (I'm less
convinced about the unconditional fee as it changes a core principle of the
network which means that we'll never reach consensus on it). What I really
like about it is that it's quite simple and can be quickly deployed without
even needing to coordinate with others or upgrade the network.
I had a similar idea but your solution adds a &quot;I endorse this payment&quot; bit
which I think can make the method a lot more effective (and unfortunately
breaks the &quot;can be deployed without upgrading the network&quot; but I think it's
worth it). However if we change the protocol, we may as well make it a
continuous risk score instead of a binary low/high-risk. Also, having only
two classes (high and low-risk) protects the the low-risk class but makes
the high-risk class even easier to attack, having a continuous policy
should mitigate this problem.
And while I agree with the general idea of throttling based on a local
reputation, I think we need more work to find a good formula to compute
this reputation. I don't have a good formula myself but relying on &quot;A
satoshis per second&quot; doesn't seem wise. There are huge disparities between
nodes and even for a given node, traffic is fluctuating a lot. I think a
more reliable indicator would be the proportion of successful payments.
The beauty of this solution is that we don't need a standardized formula
for reputation, everyone can use its own. However getting a good one is
hard so we need a default recommandation.

Thanks for your work.
Thomas

a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hi Antoine,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for the detailed response!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the framework for mitigation evaluation, there are few other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dimensions we have considered in the past with Gleb for our research that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be relevant to integrate. One is &quot;centralization&quot;, the solution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't centralize sensibly the LN ecosystem around any of its actors:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LSP, Lightning Wallet Providers (e.g watchtower or Greenlight-style infra)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or routing node, where centralization could be defined in terms of &quot;market
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entry cost&quot; for new incumbents. &quot;Protocol evolvability&quot; could be another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one, as we don't want a solution rendering the design and operations of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things like offline-receive, trampoline, negative fees, etc harder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Ecosystem impacts&quot; was one more category we thought about, e.g introducing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a mass mempool congestion vector (one of the versions of Stakes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Certificates did it...).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are indeed important dimensions. I think that our solution gets
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;good marks&#8221; in all of them, but this should definitely be stated
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the dimensions of your evaluation framework, the &quot;effectiveness&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sounds to be understood as attacker-centric. However few times after in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paper, the viewpoint of the routing nodes sounds to be adopted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (&quot;compensating them for the financial damage of jamming&quot;, &quot;breakeven point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> n&quot;). If this distinction is real, the first way would be more searching for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a game-theory equilibrium whereas much damage is inflicted to the attacker.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second one would be more to ensure a compensation for the loss income
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the routing nodes. I believe the first approach is limited as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacker's resources could overwhelm the victim's economic sustainability,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and rationality might be uneconomic. Maybe those two approaches could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combined, in the sense that loss income compensation should only be borne
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by &quot;identified&quot; attackers, however this doesn't sound the direction taken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by unconditional fees.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The effectiveness evaluation does have a few facets. From the attacker's
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoint, it might be that mitigation makes the attack impossible,
</I>&gt;<i> difficult, or expensive. From the victim's point of view, we can talk about
</I>&gt;<i> protection, compensation, or any combination of the two. Of course, the
</I>&gt;<i> best outcome is when the attack is impossible. As this is oftentimes not
</I>&gt;<i> something we can do, we have to choose one of the other outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> About &quot;incentive compatibility&quot;, one element valuable to integrate is how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much the existence of scoring algorithms allows the routing nodes to adopt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;honest behaviors&quot; and high-level of service availability. I don't know if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a jamming solution can be devised without considerations of the inner
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workings of routing/scoring algorithms, and so far every LN implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has its own cooking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We focused on the most basic incentive of not failing transactions that
</I>&gt;<i> could have been forwarded. I'll be happy to discuss other potential
</I>&gt;<i> pitfalls if you have something in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the structure of the monetary strategy, I think there could be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution to implement a proof-of-burn, where the fee is captured in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commitment output sending to a provably unspendable output. Theoretically,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's interesting as &quot;unburning&quot; the fee is dependent on counterparty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cooperation, the one potentially encumbering the jamming risk.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Proof-of-work &quot;fee&quot; has been discussed in the past by LN devs, however it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was quickly dismissed, as it would give an edge to the attacker who is able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to gather ASICs farms while completely burning the batteries of LN mobile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clients. It has also been widely discussed to make the fees conditional on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either outgoing HTLC CLTV value or effective duration. For effective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duration, an upfront fee shard could be paid after each clock tick (either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> epoch or block-based).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main problem with proof of burn or PoW is that it does not compensate
</I>&gt;<i> the victim, we write this explicitly in the newer version of the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for this comment, we will add further details on previous
</I>&gt;<i> discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the structure of reputation strategy, I think one interesting missing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point to me is the blurring of the local/global reputation definition in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lightning. At least maybe in a way traditionally defined in P2P
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> litterature. Reputation could be enforced on the HTLC sender, as we've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aimed with Stakes Certificates. The upstream peer reputation is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accounted for at all. I think it's an open question if the reputation score
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a routing node could be exported across nodes (a behavior that one could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect if you assume web-of-trust, as the current LN network topology is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heavily based on). On the statement, that attaching reputation to payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contradicts the LN's privacy-focused goal, I would say it's a light one in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regards to the state of cryptography tools like blinded signature, known
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since the 80s.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that further research on assigning the blame to the sender is of
</I>&gt;<i> interest, but as we don't have this right now, it would be good to work
</I>&gt;<i> with the available tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the analysis of the unconditional fee, I think my main objection would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be the lack of integration of the time uncertainty of the honest use-cases,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making it hard to classify between quick and slow jamming. As you say &quot;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> borderline between quick and slow jamming depends on a subjective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definition of the maximal honest payment resolution delay&quot; An attacker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should hold all its HTLC jamming for a duration of &quot;maximal honest payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution delay&quot; minus 1. Without even scoping L2s protocol like swaps or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hold-invoice where the effective duration might hold for a few blocks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modern flows like offline receive where the user has to take manual actions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to settle the HTLC could far extend beyond a few seconds. To develop my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point, fair compensation could aim for the most optimistic flow of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> short-held 0.1s payment, however a routing policy could qualify as honest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payment resolution delay duration of as much as a few minutes. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discrepancy could be exploited by an attacker to inflict an asymmetric
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> damage to the routing nodes. Of course, one fix could be to scale up the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unconditional fee amount in function of the maximal honest payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution delay accepted by the routing node policy&quot;. I wonder if it would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be suitable in terms of UX.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For special use cases, where Alice and Bob agree that HTLCs can wait for a
</I>&gt;<i> long time over the channel, they can agree that this would not change their
</I>&gt;<i> reputation with the other party. If Alice decides to knowingly forward to
</I>&gt;<i> Bob an HTLC that will not resolve quickly, without agreeing on this
</I>&gt;<i> beforehand, this is a problem and should be solved through the reputation
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For a routing node, there is the uncertainty of downstream payment path
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hops, responsible for some failures, I don't know if it's currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accounted for in the evaluation of the unconditional fee. If the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unconditional fee paid downstream is too high, there is a moral hazard for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the routing node, they can pocket the fee, depending how much they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> penalized by the sender scoring algorithm.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is addressed in inequality 5 in the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> In general, routing algorithms should avoid nodes and channels that
</I>&gt;<i> regularly fail their payments. This is true beyond the scope of upfront
</I>&gt;<i> fees, and as the upfront fees are rather low, this wouldn't be the main
</I>&gt;<i> motivation for avoiding &#8220;bad&#8221; nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the analysis of the reputation mechanism, there is one recursive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue: you might constrain the incoming HTLC traffic of your peers, even if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're all honest. Let's say you assign K slots and L satoshis of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> liquidity to your upstream peer Carioll, Caroll must know divide by (K, L)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by two to Alice and Bob, even if Alice and Bob each can offer (K, L) of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> honest HTLC traffic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are we the only node sending anything to Carol? If this is the case, our
</I>&gt;<i> channel is Carol's bottleneck, and indeed whichever limit we choose will be
</I>&gt;<i> the limit she will have to handle (this is a bit of &quot;min-cut max-flow&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> problem for Carol, where our channel is her min-cut)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Further, there is also the attack timing asymmetries, in the sense that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high-reputation score might have been earned in period of low-congestion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and consumed during period of high-congestion, so it sounds to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reputation should be quantitative rather to introduce a low-risk/high-risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> binary framework, to account for proportionality. This proportionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue is a hard thing, especially if I would like concretely to address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payments with intentionally delayed resolutions in a non-cooperative-only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As reputation policy is determined on the level of an individual node, it
</I>&gt;<i> could be that some will choose to take into account congestion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lastly, I wonder if there is not some conceptual issue with the chaining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of unconditional fee and local reputation. As I understand the distinction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between quick/slow jamming is based on this idea of maximal honest payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution delay. However, the bypass of this upper bound is only known
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _after_ the HTLC forward, and as such it sounds to me the strategie regime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (unconditional fee/local reputation) under which a HTLC forward should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evaluated is dependent on the knowledge of a future event.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We use reputation as part of a continuous game. You don't gain or lose
</I>&gt;<i> high reputation based on one HTLC, you evaluate based on the continuous
</I>&gt;<i> behavior of the node. The unconditional fee is always charged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again,
</I>&gt;<i> Clara
