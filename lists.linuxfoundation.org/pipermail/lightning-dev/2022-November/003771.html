<PRE>Hi Dave,

I think the issue you're describing about credential tampering by
intermediary nodes is correct. If Alice controls Y along the path
W-&gt;X-&gt;Y-&gt;Zed, she can waste the credentials value provided. Indeed, this
issue generalizes for any classic payment path, where a routing node can
waste the senders  credentials allocated on the downstream hops.

As discussed on the corresponding BOLT proposal, &quot;staking/reputational&quot;
credentials are probably be dependent on fat errors to assign payment path
failure correctly:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1043#discussion_r1029938977">https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1043#discussion_r1029938977</A>
(even further in the case of blinded path, the senders might need another
round with the recipient to share a subset of the fat error).

Note the usage of blinded path in the aforementioned comment is about
sending back fresh credentials if the HTLC succeeds. One alternative is to
use the per-hop shared secret and wrap them in the return HTLC onion.
Another alternative, a blinded onion route could be registered at HTLC
forward phase, and this blinded path is leveraged for the fresh credentials
refill (I think the quantity of credentials could be a privacy-leak itself,
that you would like to mask).

Best,
Antoine

</I>&gt;<i> node---with that cost mitigating the chance of the attack and the
