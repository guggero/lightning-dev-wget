<PRE>Dear Antoine and list,

I think that another call to discuss jamming would be great. I would
suggest making it a repeating call every 2 weeks, starting from Monday the
28th at 7 pm UTC.

Antoine - Thank you for your work!
I have a few questions to better understand the details.

1. Are the tokens transferable between users? For example, if Ned is a
routing node, and Alice has some of their tokens, can she give these tokens
to Bob?
If yes - could this lead to the creation of a secondary market?
If no - will that slow down the transaction flow that a new node can send?

2. Do you have a recommended policy for the creation of tokens and their
use? Ideally, there will be a policy that would mitigate both slow and
quick jamming, without harming usability too much.

3. You write &quot;the reputation credentials to liquidity units translation can
be severed&quot; - does this mean that the value of the token changes? Is that
in the spirit of changing the fees in a channel?
If this is the case, can't a routing node &quot;trick&quot; a user into buying many
tokens and then bring the price up?

4. How would these tokens work with blinded paths and other
privacy-preserving suggestions?

Thanks again,
Clara

&gt;<i> Hi LN Devs,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> tl;dr A formalization of a reputation-based scheme to solve channel
</I>&gt;<i> jamming is proposed. The system relies on &quot;credentials&quot; issued by routing
</I>&gt;<i> hops and requested to be attached to each HTLC forward request. The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;credentials&quot; can be used by a reputation algorithm to reward/punish
</I>&gt;<i> payment senders and allocate channel liquidity resources efficiently. The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;credentials&quot;  initial distribution can be bootstrapped leveraging one-time
</I>&gt;<i> upfront fees paid toward the routing hops. Afterwards, the &quot;credentials&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> subsequent distribution can rely on previous HTLC traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A protocol description can be found here, with few extensions already to
</I>&gt;<i> the BOLTs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1043">https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1043</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a work-in-progress proof-of-concept in LDK (on top of our
</I>&gt;<i> coming soon^TM  HTLC intercepting API):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1848">https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1848</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This work builds on previous reputation-scheme research [0] [1]. It also
</I>&gt;<i> integrates the more recent proposals of upfront fees as a straightforward
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to bootstrap the reputation system. Bootstrapping the system with
</I>&gt;<i> more economically cost-effective privacy-preserving UTXO ownership proofs
</I>&gt;<i> not only add another layer of engineering complexity, there is still a
</I>&gt;<i> proof size vs proof generation/validation trade-off to arbiter between ZKP
</I>&gt;<i> cryptosystems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rather to seek for a game-theory equilibrium defined as a breakeven point
</I>&gt;<i> as in the latest unconditional fee research [2], this proposal aims to use
</I>&gt;<i> reputation credentials to allow HTLC traffic-shaping. This not only should
</I>&gt;<i> protect against jamming situations (either malicious
</I>&gt;<i> or spontaneous) but also allow active HTLC traffic-shaping, where a
</I>&gt;<i> routing hop can allow extended channel liquidity lockups based on
</I>&gt;<i> accumulated reputation (e.g for hold-invoices). This is also a reduced
</I>&gt;<i> overhead cost, as upfront fees are only paid at bootstrap, or when the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> forward behavior can be qualified as &quot;whitewashing&quot; from the routing hop
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be noted, this current reputation-credential architectural
</I>&gt;<i> framework assumes credentials distribution at the endpoint of the network.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the framework should be flexible enough for the credentials to be
</I>&gt;<i> harvested by the LSPs, and then distributed in a secondary fashion to their
</I>&gt;<i> spokes, when they need it, or even attached transparently thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> trampoline. So one design intuition, there is no strong attachment of the
</I>&gt;<i> reputation to the endpoint HTLC sender, even if the protocol is described
</I>&gt;<i> in a &quot;flat&quot; view for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's evaluate quickly this mitigation proposal against a few criterias
</I>&gt;<i> emerged from recent research.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mitigation is effective, in the sense a routing hop can apply a
</I>&gt;<i> proportional relationship between the acquisition of the reputation and the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of liquidity resources credited in function of said reputation. In a
</I>&gt;<i> period of steady state, the reputation acquisition cost can be downgraded
</I>&gt;<i> to 0. In periods of channel congestion, the reputation credentials to
</I>&gt;<i> liquidity units translation can be severed, in the limit of routing hop
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable competitiveness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mitigation is incentive-compatible, if the credentials are not honored
</I>&gt;<i> by their issuers, the HTLC senders can evict them from the routing network
</I>&gt;<i> view for a while. The successful usage of credentials can lead to more
</I>&gt;<i> credentials allocated for longer and more capacity-intensive channel
</I>&gt;<i> lockups. In case of HTLC failure, the failure source could be forgiven by
</I>&gt;<i> routing hops to maintain the worthiness of the sender credentials.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mitigation can be made transparent from the user, as the credentials
</I>&gt;<i> harvesting can be done automatically from a pre-allocated budget, similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the fee-bumping reserves requirement introduced by anchor output. At the
</I>&gt;<i> end of today, if we take modern browsers as an example, the average user
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't check manually the TLS certificates (for what they're worth...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mitigation can conserve high-level privacy, as the usage of blinded
</I>&gt;<i> signature (or another equivalent cryptosystem breaking signature/message
</I>&gt;<i> linking) should allow the credentials issued during a preliminary phase to
</I>&gt;<i> be undistinguishable during the redeem/usage phase. New CPU/memory DoS
</I>&gt;<i> vectors due to the credentials processing should be watched out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About the ease of implementation, there are few protocol messages to
</I>&gt;<i> modify, a HTLC intercepting API is assumed as supported by the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, onion messages support is also implied, landing EC blinded
</I>&gt;<i> signature in libsecp256k1-zkp shouldn't be a big deal, routing algorithms
</I>&gt;<i> adaptations might be more serious but still reasonable. The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;credentials-to-liquidity&quot; allocation algorithms are likely the new real
</I>&gt;<i> beast, though I don't think any reputation scheme can spare them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There could be a concern about the centralization inertia introduced by a
</I>&gt;<i> reputation system.  Intuitively, the argument can be made that any
</I>&gt;<i> historical tracking (such as routing buckets) favor established LN
</I>&gt;<i> incumbents at the gain of efficiency. A counter-argument can be made, a new
</I>&gt;<i> routing hop can lower the acquisition cost of its issued credentials to
</I>&gt;<i> attract more HTLC traffic (accepting higher jamming risk).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the ecosystem impacts, it should be studied that this proposal would
</I>&gt;<i> impact things like inbound channel routing fees [3], ratecard [4] or
</I>&gt;<i> flow-control valve [5] and the whole liquidity toolchain. Hopefully, we
</I>&gt;<i> don't significantly restrain the design space for future LN protocol
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the proposal modularity and flexibility, each routing node has
</I>&gt;<i> oversight on its routing policy, acquisition methods, credentials to
</I>&gt;<i> liquidity rate. New acquisition methods can be experimented or deployed
</I>&gt;<i> when ready, e.g stakes certificates with only e2e upgrade. The credentials
</I>&gt;<i> themselves could have &quot;innate&quot; expiration time if we use things like
</I>&gt;<i> short-lived ZKP [6]. The credentials framework can be extended beyond
</I>&gt;<i> solving jamming, as a generalized risk-management framework for Bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized financial network, e.g transaction signature exchange
</I>&gt;<i> ordering in multi-party transactions [7] or finding reliable Coinjoin
</I>&gt;<i> counterparties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Antoine
