<PRE>Hi all,

We are planning a call to discuss this proposal further. It will be on
Monday the 14th, at 7 pm UTC here:

Please let me know if this conflicts with any other Bitcoin event.

Hope to see you all there!

&gt;<i> Hi list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would like to share with you our recent research on jamming in
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning. We propose a combination of unconditional (~ upfront) fees and
</I>&gt;<i> local reputation to fight jamming. We believe this can be a basis for an
</I>&gt;<i> efficient and practical solution that can be implemented in the foreseeable
</I>&gt;<i> future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The full paper is available [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We classify jams into quick (resolve in seconds, mimicking honest
</I>&gt;<i> payments) and slow (remain in-flight for hours or days). Fees
</I>&gt;<i> disincentivize an attack where quick jams are constantly resolved and sent
</I>&gt;<i> again. Reputation, in turn, allows nodes to deprioritize peers who
</I>&gt;<i> consistently forward slow jams.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We believe that our proposal is practical and efficient. In particular, we
</I>&gt;<i> have shown that the additional (unconditional) fees can be relatively low
</I>&gt;<i> (as low as 2% of the total fee) to fully compensate jamming victims for the
</I>&gt;<i> lost routing revenue. Moreover, the total unconditional fee paid for all
</I>&gt;<i> failed attempts stays low even if the failure rate is reasonably high. This
</I>&gt;<i> means that the UX burden of paying for failed attempts is also low. A
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward PoC implementation [2] demonstrates one approach to
</I>&gt;<i> implementing the fee-related aspect of our proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further sections provide more details on our approach and results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Jamming
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a reminder, jamming is a DoS attack where a malicious sender initiates
</I>&gt;<i> payments (jams) but delays finalizing them, blocking channels along the
</I>&gt;<i> route until the jams are resolved. Jamming may target liquidity or payment
</I>&gt;<i> slots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We distinguish between quick and slow jamming. Quick jamming implies that
</I>&gt;<i> jams are failed and re-sent every few seconds, making them hardly
</I>&gt;<i> distinguishable from honest failing payments. In slow jamming, jams remain
</I>&gt;<i> in-flight for hours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Unconditional fees
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We propose unconditional fees to discourage quick jamming. Currently, jams
</I>&gt;<i> are free because routing nodes don&#8217;t charge for failed payment attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> With unconditional fees, however, jamming is no longer free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our simulations indicate that unconditional fees don&#8217;t have to be too
</I>&gt;<i> high. Under certain assumptions about the honest payment flow, a fee
</I>&gt;<i> increase by just 2% (paid upfront) fully compensates a routing node under
</I>&gt;<i> attack. Our simulator is open-source [3]. A PoC implementation demonstrates
</I>&gt;<i> one approach to implementing unconditional fees and only requires minor
</I>&gt;<i> changes [2].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have also considered the UX implications of paying for failed attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> We have concluded that this should not be a deal-breaker, as the total
</I>&gt;<i> unconditional fee paid stays low even if the failure rate is reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> high (even as high as 50%). Privacy and incentives are also discussed in
</I>&gt;<i> the paper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Reputation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fees are not very effective in preventing slow jamming: this type of
</I>&gt;<i> attack requires only a few jams, therefore, fees would have to be too high
</I>&gt;<i> to be effective. Instead, we address slow jamming using local reputation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As per our proposal, nodes keep track of their peers&#8217; past behavior. A
</I>&gt;<i> routing node considers its peer &#8220;good&#8221; if it only forwards honest payments
</I>&gt;<i> that resolve quickly and bring sufficient fee revenue. A peer that forwards
</I>&gt;<i> jams, in contrast, loses reputation. Payments endorsed by a high-reputation
</I>&gt;<i> peer are forwarded on the best efforts basis, while other (&#8220;high-risk&#8221;)
</I>&gt;<i> payments can only use a predefined quota of liquidity and slots. Unless the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker has built up a reputation in advance, it cannot fully jam a
</I>&gt;<i> channel with at least some liquidity allocated exclusively to low-risk
</I>&gt;<i> payments. Nodes parameterize their channels according to their risk
</I>&gt;<i> tolerance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Alternatives and Future Work
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this work, we strive for a systematic approach. First, we list five
</I>&gt;<i> properties a potential mitigation strategy should have: effectiveness,
</I>&gt;<i> incentive compatibility, user experience, privacy and security, and ease of
</I>&gt;<i> implementation. Then, we go over the design decisions to be made when
</I>&gt;<i> constructing a countermeasure against jamming. Based on the desired
</I>&gt;<i> criteria and the available options, we converge on a solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple approaches to jamming mitigation have been discussed on this list
</I>&gt;<i> and elsewhere. Many of them may well be worth exploring, such as
</I>&gt;<i> resolution-time-dependent fee amounts or stake certificates for reputation
</I>&gt;<i> building. However, we believe that our solution strikes a good balance: it
</I>&gt;<i> addresses the problem in question and is relatively straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would love to bring this idea closer to implementation, and we plan to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss it over the next spec meeting [4] (Monday, 2022-11-07). We&#8217;d
</I>&gt;<i> greatly appreciate your feedback!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
