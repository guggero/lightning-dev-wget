<PRE>Hi Antoine,

Thank you for the detailed response!



&gt;<i> On the framework for mitigation evaluation, there are few other dimensions
</I>&gt;<i> we have considered in the past with Gleb for our research that could be
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to integrate. One is &quot;centralization&quot;, the solution shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> centralize sensibly the LN ecosystem around any of its actors: LSP,
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning Wallet Providers (e.g watchtower or Greenlight-style infra) or
</I>&gt;<i> routing node, where centralization could be defined in terms of &quot;market
</I>&gt;<i> entry cost&quot; for new incumbents. &quot;Protocol evolvability&quot; could be another
</I>&gt;<i> one, as we don't want a solution rendering the design and operations of
</I>&gt;<i> things like offline-receive, trampoline, negative fees, etc harder.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ecosystem impacts&quot; was one more category we thought about, e.g introducing
</I>&gt;<i> a mass mempool congestion vector (one of the versions of Stakes
</I>&gt;<i> Certificates did it...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
These are indeed important dimensions. I think that our solution gets &#8220;good
marks&#8221; in all of them, but this should definitely be stated explicitly in
the future.


&gt;<i> For the dimensions of your evaluation framework, the &quot;effectiveness&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> sounds to be understood as attacker-centric. However few times after in the
</I>&gt;<i> paper, the viewpoint of the routing nodes sounds to be adopted
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;compensating them for the financial damage of jamming&quot;, &quot;breakeven point
</I>&gt;<i> n&quot;). If this distinction is real, the first way would be more searching for
</I>&gt;<i> a game-theory equilibrium whereas much damage is inflicted to the attacker.
</I>&gt;<i> The second one would be more to ensure a compensation for the loss income
</I>&gt;<i> for the routing nodes. I believe the first approach is limited as the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker's resources could overwhelm the victim's economic sustainability,
</I>&gt;<i> and rationality might be uneconomic. Maybe those two approaches could be
</I>&gt;<i> combined, in the sense that loss income compensation should only be borne
</I>&gt;<i> by &quot;identified&quot; attackers, however this doesn't sound the direction taken
</I>&gt;<i> by unconditional fees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The effectiveness evaluation does have a few facets. From the attacker's
viewpoint, it might be that mitigation makes the attack impossible,
difficult, or expensive. From the victim's point of view, we can talk about
protection, compensation, or any combination of the two. Of course, the
best outcome is when the attack is impossible. As this is oftentimes not
something we can do, we have to choose one of the other outcomes.


&gt;<i> About &quot;incentive compatibility&quot;, one element valuable to integrate is how
</I>&gt;<i> much the existence of scoring algorithms allows the routing nodes to adopt
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;honest behaviors&quot; and high-level of service availability. I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> a jamming solution can be devised without considerations of the inner
</I>&gt;<i> workings of routing/scoring algorithms, and so far every LN implementation
</I>&gt;<i> has its own cooking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We focused on the most basic incentive of not failing transactions that
could have been forwarded. I'll be happy to discuss other potential
pitfalls if you have something in mind.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the structure of the monetary strategy, I think there could be a
</I>&gt;<i> solution to implement a proof-of-burn, where the fee is captured in a
</I>&gt;<i> commitment output sending to a provably unspendable output. Theoretically,
</I>&gt;<i> it's interesting as &quot;unburning&quot; the fee is dependent on counterparty
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation, the one potentially encumbering the jamming risk.
</I>&gt;<i> Proof-of-work &quot;fee&quot; has been discussed in the past by LN devs, however it
</I>&gt;<i> was quickly dismissed, as it would give an edge to the attacker who is able
</I>&gt;<i> to gather ASICs farms while completely burning the batteries of LN mobile
</I>&gt;<i> clients. It has also been widely discussed to make the fees conditional on
</I>&gt;<i> either outgoing HTLC CLTV value or effective duration. For effective
</I>&gt;<i> duration, an upfront fee shard could be paid after each clock tick (either
</I>&gt;<i> epoch or block-based).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The main problem with proof of burn or PoW is that it does not compensate
the victim, we write this explicitly in the newer version of the paper.
Thanks for this comment, we will add further details on previous
discussions.


&gt;<i> On the structure of reputation strategy, I think one interesting missing
</I>&gt;<i> point to me is the blurring of the local/global reputation definition in
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning. At least maybe in a way traditionally defined in P2P
</I>&gt;<i> litterature. Reputation could be enforced on the HTLC sender, as we've
</I>&gt;<i> aimed with Stakes Certificates. The upstream peer reputation is not
</I>&gt;<i> accounted for at all. I think it's an open question if the reputation score
</I>&gt;<i> of a routing node could be exported across nodes (a behavior that one could
</I>&gt;<i> expect if you assume web-of-trust, as the current LN network topology is
</I>&gt;<i> heavily based on). On the statement, that attaching reputation to payment
</I>&gt;<i> contradicts the LN's privacy-focused goal, I would say it's a light one in
</I>&gt;<i> regards to the state of cryptography tools like blinded signature, known
</I>&gt;<i> since the 80s.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that further research on assigning the blame to the sender is of
interest, but as we don't have this right now, it would be good to work
with the available tools.


&gt;<i> On the analysis of the unconditional fee, I think my main objection would
</I>&gt;<i> be the lack of integration of the time uncertainty of the honest use-cases,
</I>&gt;<i> making it hard to classify between quick and slow jamming. As you say &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> borderline between quick and slow jamming depends on a subjective
</I>&gt;<i> definition of the maximal honest payment resolution delay&quot; An attacker
</I>&gt;<i> should hold all its HTLC jamming for a duration of &quot;maximal honest payment
</I>&gt;<i> resolution delay&quot; minus 1. Without even scoping L2s protocol like swaps or
</I>&gt;<i> hold-invoice where the effective duration might hold for a few blocks,
</I>&gt;<i> modern flows like offline receive where the user has to take manual actions
</I>&gt;<i> to settle the HTLC could far extend beyond a few seconds. To develop my
</I>&gt;<i> point, fair compensation could aim for the most optimistic flow of
</I>&gt;<i> short-held 0.1s payment, however a routing policy could qualify as honest
</I>&gt;<i> payment resolution delay duration of as much as a few minutes. This
</I>&gt;<i> discrepancy could be exploited by an attacker to inflict an asymmetric
</I>&gt;<i> damage to the routing nodes. Of course, one fix could be to scale up the
</I>&gt;<i> unconditional fee amount in function of the maximal honest payment
</I>&gt;<i> resolution delay accepted by the routing node policy&quot;. I wonder if it would
</I>&gt;<i> be suitable in terms of UX.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For special use cases, where Alice and Bob agree that HTLCs can wait for a
long time over the channel, they can agree that this would not change their
reputation with the other party. If Alice decides to knowingly forward to
Bob an HTLC that will not resolve quickly, without agreeing on this
beforehand, this is a problem and should be solved through the reputation
system.


&gt;<i> For a routing node, there is the uncertainty of downstream payment path
</I>&gt;<i> hops, responsible for some failures, I don't know if it's currently
</I>&gt;<i> accounted for in the evaluation of the unconditional fee. If the
</I>&gt;<i> unconditional fee paid downstream is too high, there is a moral hazard for
</I>&gt;<i> the routing node, they can pocket the fee, depending how much they're
</I>&gt;<i> penalized by the sender scoring algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is addressed in inequality 5 in the paper.
In general, routing algorithms should avoid nodes and channels that
regularly fail their payments. This is true beyond the scope of upfront
fees, and as the upfront fees are rather low, this wouldn't be the main
motivation for avoiding &#8220;bad&#8221; nodes.



&gt;<i> On the analysis of the reputation mechanism, there is one recursive issue:
</I>&gt;<i> you might constrain the incoming HTLC traffic of your peers, even if
</I>&gt;<i> they're all honest. Let's say you assign K slots and L satoshis of
</I>&gt;<i> liquidity to your upstream peer Carioll, Caroll must know divide by (K, L)
</I>&gt;<i> by two to Alice and Bob, even if Alice and Bob each can offer (K, L) of
</I>&gt;<i> honest HTLC traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Are we the only node sending anything to Carol? If this is the case, our
channel is Carol's bottleneck, and indeed whichever limit we choose will be
the limit she will have to handle (this is a bit of &quot;min-cut max-flow&quot;
problem for Carol, where our channel is her min-cut)


&gt;<i> Further, there is also the attack timing asymmetries, in the sense that a
</I>&gt;<i> high-reputation score might have been earned in period of low-congestion,
</I>&gt;<i> and consumed during period of high-congestion, so it sounds to me
</I>&gt;<i> reputation should be quantitative rather to introduce a low-risk/high-risk
</I>&gt;<i> binary framework, to account for proportionality. This proportionality
</I>&gt;<i> issue is a hard thing, especially if I would like concretely to address
</I>&gt;<i> payments with intentionally delayed resolutions in a non-cooperative-only
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As reputation policy is determined on the level of an individual node, it
could be that some will choose to take into account congestion.


&gt;<i> Lastly, I wonder if there is not some conceptual issue with the chaining
</I>&gt;<i> of unconditional fee and local reputation. As I understand the distinction
</I>&gt;<i> between quick/slow jamming is based on this idea of maximal honest payment
</I>&gt;<i> resolution delay. However, the bypass of this upper bound is only known
</I>&gt;<i> _after_ the HTLC forward, and as such it sounds to me the strategie regime
</I>&gt;<i> (unconditional fee/local reputation) under which a HTLC forward should be
</I>&gt;<i> evaluated is dependent on the knowledge of a future event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We use reputation as part of a continuous game. You don't gain or lose high
reputation based on one HTLC, you evaluate based on the continuous behavior
of the node. The unconditional fee is always charged.


Thanks again,
Clara
