Hi ZmnSCPxj,


Yep, I'm pretty sure this works the way you describe -- essentially replace
the hash challenges with adaptor signatures which are reblinded at each layer.
Because adaptor signatures can make arbitrary sets of signatures atomic (and
don't require any precommitments in the blockchain) it's easy to do multipath
stuff this way. And using discrete logs as challenges makes reblinding and
transferrable proof-of-payment easy.

It's also true that you can use BIP32 hardened keys for the challenges. You
might as well use HMAC rather than a hash for the sake of standardness, but
I don't think there's any particular reason to do this for key derivation.

Then Taproot can hide the non-cooperative cases as you mention.


I've been working on understanding Lightning and figuring out best way to
use the full power of scriptless scripts. I think we can do better than just
dropping TR+SS into the existing architecture. (Some of AJ's recent emails
to the list have been one-sided commentary on ideas I floated to him in
person recently, but I haven't had time to get everything straight enough
in my mind to reply.)

For example, with adaptor signatures + Graftroot [1], one party can make their
commit-tx signature atomic with a delegation to a timelock script; the other
party does the same but for a different timelock script. Then maybe both parties
can share the same commit tx rather than doing the symmetric thing, which would
save space and simplify the protocol a bit. And more generally, this &quot;output
has different spend conditions depending on who publishes to the chain&quot; primitive
seems like a really powerful thing, and AFAIK nobody has noticed this feature of
Graftroot until very recently.


Cheers

Andrew

&gt;<i> Good morning list,

</I>&gt;<i> I sketch here the idea, of making atomic multipath payment (AMP), with the properties:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Has a proof-of-payment.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Multipath decorrelation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: I am not a mathematician.  Thus, it is likely, that there is a mistake here, and we cannot make this work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, we look at BIP32 hierarchically derived (HD) keys by Wuille.  Roughly, given a parent private key k_par, we can do derive k_i child keys for integer i by:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> k_i = H(i || k_par * G) + k_par
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where H(x) is a hash function and G is the generator point. (this it not quite how BIP32 does it, it uses HMAC, maybe that is safer for some reason that my non-mathematician self is unaware of...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The parent public key K_par = k_par * G.  We can derive K_i public child keys for integer i by:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> K_i = H(i || K_par) * G + K_par
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I think)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that K_i = k_i * G still, as is usual for elliptic curve asymmetric cryptography:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> K_i = k_i * G = (H(i || k_par * G) + k_par) * G = H(i || k_par * G) * G + k_par * G = H(i || K_par) * G + K_par
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of note is that if we know an i, a private child key k_i corresponding to that i, and the public parent key K_par, we can derive the private parent key k_par:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> k_i = H(i || K_par) + k_par
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> k_par = k_i - H(i || K_par)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now all we need is to have a conditional payment, which can only be performed if the payee provides a private key which matches a public key, i.e. given x * G, the payee must provide x.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately Poelstra has done this work beforehand in the Scriptless Script (SS) concept, where the payee provides a T = t * G, and the Scriptless Script construction requires that the payee reveal the t in order to claim the payment.  I will not go into the math since there is a good chance I shall make a mistake; look up discussions by better mathematicians by me.  Scriptless Script requires Bellare-Neven (BN) signatures to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that Scriptless Script handles only the equivalent of hashlocking.  We still need a timelock in case the payee refuses to reveal the proof-of-payment t.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, Maxwell has provided a construction, taproot (TR).  This construction has two top-level branches: a Bellare-Neven n-of-n, or a Bitcoin Script.  We know that Scriptless Script can make an equivalent to a hashlock from a Bellare-Neven n-of-n.  The other branch of a taproot construction can now be a simple OP_CLTV+OP_CHECKSIG script, forming the timelock half of an HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How would a multipath payment work?  The invoice would contain the parent public key K_par.  From this, the payer derives as many K_i, as it needs to split the payment to.  It sets up conditional payments that require revelation of the private child key k_i for each K_i it derives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the payee receives a partial payment, it is not incentivized to claim it immediately yet.  This is because revelation of even one child key k_i will, in combination with the parent public key K_par, reveal the parent private key k_par, which serves as proof-of-payment.  The payee will wait for the entire payment to reach it, and then claim all of them.  This reveals all the private child keys k_i, any one of which will let the payer extract the parent private key k_par that serves as proof-of-payment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each path has a different k_i, thus providing multipath decorrelation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Please check my math --- I am not a mathematician and it is possible I have made a mistake somewhere)
</I>&gt;<i>
