<PRE>Hey everyone,

disclaimer I am new here and have not a full understanding of the complete
specs yet - however since I decided to participate in lighting dev I will
just be brave and try to add my ideas on the problem jimpo posed. So even
in case by ideas are complete bs please just tell me in a friendly way and
I know I need to read more code and specs in order to participate.

Reading about the described problem techniques like IP-Fragmentation (
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation</A> ) come to my mind. The
setting is a little bit different but in from my current understanding it
should still be applicable and also be the favorable solution in comparison
to the proposed ping:

1.) IP setting: In IP-Fragmentation one would obviously just split the
IP-package in order to utilize a link layer protocol that doesn't have
enough bandwidth for a bigger size package.
2.) Lightning case: When the capacity of a channel during routing is not
high enough - which means that the channel balance on that side is
somewhere between 0 and the size of the payment - one would have to to send
the second part of the fragmented package on a different route. This is
obvious since the insufficient channel balance cannot come out of thin air
(as in IP-Routing).

My first intuition was that this would become a problem for onion routing
since the router in question does not know the final destination but only
knows the next hop which can't be utilized as the channel doesn't have
enough funds. However I imagine one could just encapsulate the second part
of the fragmented payment in a new onion routed package that goes on a
detour (using different payment channels) to the original &quot;next&quot; hop und
progresses from there as it was originally thought of.

Not sure however how the impacts to the HTLC would be and if it would
actually be possible to fragment a payment that is encapsulated within the
onion routing.

If possible the advantage in comparison to your proposed ping method is
that fragmentation would be highly dynamic and still work if a channel runs
out of funds while routing payment. In your ping scenario it could very
well happen that you do a ping for a designated rout, everything looks
great, you send a payment but while it is on its way a channel on that way
could run dry.

</I>&gt;<i> The main benefit is that this should make it quicker to send a successful

</I>&gt;<i> by the same token, it is faster and cheaper for someone to extract
</I>&gt;<i> information about channel capacities on the network with a binary search.
