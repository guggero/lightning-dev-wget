If failure is common this would be true, but I think it's too early to
design for it.

This kind of signalling is what fees are for: when capacity gets low you
increase fees, and when it gets high, you reduce them.  But that may
still prove insufficient.

Two things come to mind:

1. `temporary_channel_failure` returns a `channel_update`.  The
   implication is that this has the disabled flag, but we should
   probably make that true iff the request asks for &lt; 2% of the channel
   capacity or some &quot;minimal bar&quot;.  If you can't even service this, you
   should disable the channel.

2. We can implement fast failure to reduce latency:

Note that there needs to be more analysis on reliable ways to mask the
active capacity of a channel: using a static random threshold still
leaks information that *something* has happened, so it may need to be
more sophisticated.

Cheers,
Rusty.
