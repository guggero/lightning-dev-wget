If you are including a smaller return onion, you are including that with
the payment? That return onion would be created by the payer since they
know the routes from the payer to the payee? If so, how could this work
if the route no longer has capacity (or goes down) by the time the payee
decides it's going to send the refund back to the payer (which could be
minutes, hours, or days later)? Also, even if all routes are still up,
the payer may not necessarily know how much refund the payee will be
giving them, so they may not necessarily be able to even know what the
best route they should build an onion for?
