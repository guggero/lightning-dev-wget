You're right.  While optimal routes aren't necessary, failures are
possible and made worse by the inability to retry via a different route.
I've noted this on the brainstorming phase.

We don't currently return a reply message on success, but we could.
It's best-effort of course (it won't appear if we drop to chain).  I
wonder if we could use that somehow.

The general solution seems to require an ability to send payments to an
anonymous destinations, which we don't have.

Thanks!
Rusty.
