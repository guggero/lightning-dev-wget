<PRE>Good example, even if rather hard to setup :-)

What I meant with the attack being identical is that we can replay the
entire attack on-chain, without needing Lightning in the first place,
i.e., the attacker needed to own the funds he is going to steal at some
time, whether that is as part of a channel settlement that is repalced
or an output that has been spent.

You are however right that Lightning with its multi-hop payments
increases the potential exposure of a node, increasing the attackers
payoff in case of a successful attack.

Cheers,
Christian

&gt;<i> Hey Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you on almost anything you said. however I disagree that in
</I>&gt;<i> the lightning case it produces just another double spending. I wish to to
</I>&gt;<i> emphasize on my statement that the in the case with lightning such a 51%
</I>&gt;<i> attack can steal way more BTC than double spending my own funds. The
</I>&gt;<i> following example is a little extrem and constructed but it should help to
</I>&gt;<i> make the point. Also for pure convenience reasons I neglected the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> channels should never be worse distributed than 99% to 1%:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us assume I am the attacker currently owning 1000 BTC. Now 1000 nodes
</I>&gt;<i> called n_0,...n_{999} open a payment channel with me (all funded by the
</I>&gt;<i> other side with 999 BTC in each channel (and 1 BTC from me)) resulting in
</I>&gt;<i> the following channel balance sheet:
</I>&gt;<i> c_0: me = 1 BTC and n_0 = 999 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> c_1: me = 1 BTC and n_1 = 999 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> c_2: me = 1 BTC and n_2 = 999 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> c_{999}: me = 1 BTC and n_{999} = 999 BTC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now node n_0 sends 1 BTC to each node n_1,...,n_{999} (using me for routing
</I>&gt;<i> the payment) so the channel balances read:
</I>&gt;<i> c_0: me =   1000 BTC and n_0 =       0 BTC (save the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction!)
</I>&gt;<i> c_1: me =         0 BTC and n_1 = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> c_2: me =         0 BTC and n_2 = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> c_{999}: me=      0 BTC and n_{999} = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> next n_1 sends 1000 BTC to n_0:
</I>&gt;<i> c_0: me =         0 BTC and n_0 = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> c_1: me =   1000 BTC and n_1 =        0 BTC  (save the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction!)
</I>&gt;<i> c_2: me =         0 BTC and n_2 = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> c_{999}: me=      0 BTC and n_{999} = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> similarly  n_2 sends 1000 BTC to n_1:
</I>&gt;<i> c_0: me =         0 BTC and n_0 = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> c_1: me =         0 BTC and n_1 = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i> c_2: me =   1000 BTC and n_2 =        0 BTC  (save the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction!)
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> c_{999}: me =     0 BTC nad n_{999} = 1000 BTC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> following this scheme n_3 --[1000 BTC]--&gt; n_2, n_4 --[1000 BTC]--&gt; n_3,...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> due to this (as mentioned highly constructed and artificial behavior) I
</I>&gt;<i> will have old commitment transactions in *each* and every channel (which
</I>&gt;<i> spends 1000 BTC to me)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When starting my secret mining endeavor I spend those commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transactions which gives in this particular case 1000 * 1000 BTC = 1M BTC
</I>&gt;<i> to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So while I agree that a 51% is a problem for any blockchain technology I
</I>&gt;<i> think the consequences in the lightning scenario are way more problematic
</I>&gt;<i> and makes such an attack also way more interesting for a dishonest
</I>&gt;<i> fraudulent person / group. In particular I could run for a decade on stable
</I>&gt;<i> payment channels storing old state and at some point realizing it would be
</I>&gt;<i> a really big opportunity secretly cashing in all those old transactions
</I>&gt;<i> which can't be revoked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess one way of resolving this kind of limitless but rare possibility
</I>&gt;<i> for stealing could be to make sure no one can have more than 2 or three
</I>&gt;<i> times the amount of BTC she owns in all the payment channels the person has
</I>&gt;<i> open. As funding transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain one
</I>&gt;<i> could at least use that measure to warn people before opening and funding
</I>&gt;<i> another payment channel with a node that is heavily underfunded. Also in
</I>&gt;<i> the sense of network topology such a measure would probably make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> channels are somewhat equally funded.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ren&#233;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very good question. I think the simple answer is that this is exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the reason why not having a participant in the network that can 51%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attack over a prolonged period is one of the base assumptions in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lightning. These attacks are deadly to all blockchains, and we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly no different in that regard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> More interesting is the assertion that this may indeed be more dangerous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a classical 51% attack, in which an attacker can only doublespend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funds that she had control over at some point during the attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (duration being defined as the period she can build a hidden fork of). I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think the case for Lightning is not more dangerous since what they could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do is enforce an old state in which they had a higher balance than in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the final state, without incurring in a penalty. The key observation is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that in this old state they actually had to have the balance they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stealing on the channel. So this maps directly to the classical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenario in which an attacker simply doublespends funds they had control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over during the attack, making the attack pretty much the same.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another interesting observation is that with Lightning the state that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the attacker is enforcing may predate the attack, e.g., an attacker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could use a state that existed and was replaced before it started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generating its fork. This is in contrast to the classical doublespend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attack in which invalidated spends have to happen after the fork
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started, and the attacker just filters them from its fork.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as I said before, if we can't count on there not being a 51%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacker, then things are pretty much broken anyway :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hey everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; disclaimer: as mentioned in my other mail (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="../index.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2018-March/001065.html
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ) I am currently studying the revocation system of duplex micropayment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channels in detail but I am also pretty new to the topic. So I hope the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attack I am about to describe is not possible and it is just me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overseeing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; some detail or rather my lack of understanding.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; That being said even after waiting one week upon discovery and double
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; checking the assumptions I made I am still positive that the revocation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; system in its current form allows for a new form of a 51% attack. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attack seems to be way more harmful than a successful 51% attack on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; bitcoin network. Afaik within the bitcoin network I could 'only double
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; spend' my own funds with a successful 51% attack. In the lightning case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; seems that an attacker could steal an arbitrary amount of funds as long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the attacker has enough payment channels with enough balance open.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The attack itself follows exactly the philosophy of lightning: &quot;If a tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it. Does it make a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sound?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In the context of the attack this would translate to: &quot;If a 51% attacker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; secretly mines enough blocks after fraudulently spending old commitment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; transactions and no one sees it during the the *to_self_delay*  period,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have the commitment transactions been spent? (How) Can they be revoked?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As for the technical details I quote from the spec of BOLT 3:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;*To allow an opportunity for penalty transactions, in case of a revoked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; commitment transaction, all outputs that return funds to the owner of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; commitment transaction (a.k.a. the &quot;local node&quot;) must be delayed for *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; *to_self_delay** blocks. This delay is done in a second-stage HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; transaction (HTLC-success for HTLCs accepted by the local node,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; HTLC-timeout for HTLCs offered by the local node)*&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Assume an attacker has 51% of the hash power she could open several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; lightning channels and in particular accept any incoming payment channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (the more balance is in her channels the more lucrative the 51% attack).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Since the attacker already has a lot of hash power it is reasonable (but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; not necessary) to assume that the attacker already has a lot of bitcoins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and is well known to honest nodes in the network which makes it even more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; likely to have many open channels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The attacker keeps track of her (revocable) commitment transactions in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; which the balance is mostly on the attackers side. Once the attacker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; enough of these (old) commitment transactions the attack is being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in the following way:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 0.) The max value of to_self_delay is evaluated. Let us assume it is 72
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; blocks (or half a day).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1.) The attacker secretly starts mining on her own but does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broadcasts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; any successfully mined block. Since the attacker has 51% of the hash
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; she will most likely be faster than the network to mine the 72 blocks of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the safety period in which fraudulent commitment transactions could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; revoked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2.) The attacker spends all the fraudulent (old) commitment transactions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the first block of her secrete mining endeavor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3.) Meanwhile the attacker starts spending her own funds of her payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channels e.g on decentralized exchanges for any other (crypto)currency.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4.) As soon as the attacker has mined enough blocks that the commitment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; transactions cannot be revoked she broadcasts her secretly minded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; blockchain which will be accepted by the network as it is the longest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; chain. (In Particular she includes all the other bitcoin transactions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; are also in the original public blockchain so that other people don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; realize something suspicious has happened.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Since according to the spec channels should never be balanced worse than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 99% to 1% the attacker could steal up to 99% of all the bitcoins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allocated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in the sum of all payment channels the attacker was connected to. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; amount could obviously be way higher than just double spending her own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; funds. This attack would be interesting in particular for the power nodes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; created by the Barabasi-Albert model of lnd's autopilot (c.f.:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/677">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/677</A> ).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that with the growth of the bitcoin (mining) network a 51%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attack becomes less and less likely. Also I am very happy to be proven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; false about the attack that I am describing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Another sad thing about this attack is that I currently do not see any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (reasonable) way of preventing this form of a 51% attack (other than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; creating payment channels that don't offer the possibility of revocation)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; as it is abusing exactly the core idea of lightning to do something in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; secret without broadcasting it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
