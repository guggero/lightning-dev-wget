<PRE>Hi Andy,


1. Don't confuse TOR onion routing (used for anonymous/pseudonymous
communication) with Lightning onion routing (used for anonymous
payments). TOR's design is outside the scope of the discussion; as far
as I can see, TOR is only relevant because it exists, it works(*) and it
is useful to us. The &quot;partial onion route&quot; is about Lightning's onion
routing. You could consider the start of the partial route as an
&quot;introduction point&quot;; it is selected by the payee(**). I'm not sure if
it is exactly equivalent to TOR's introduction points though.


2. Good thinking. I guess that, since either payer *or* payee will
decide on the amount, there is no use case for omitting the amount in an
invoice in BOLT 12; unlike BOLT 11, it should not be optional here. So
that's not a problem for the partial onion route. Unknown capacity is an
issue, and I guess it's worse than if the payer is completely free to
choose a route, because the payer is no longer completely free to choose
alternative routes. Giving a batch of alternative routes is one concept
(TBD: can they have the same payment hash?); giving new alternatives
interactively is another option. I think using the same &quot;introduction
point&quot; for all routes is best for privacy: otherwise the payer could
determine the neighborhood of the payee.


3. True. Right now I'm thinking in the opposite direction: simplifying
BOLT 12 by removing the possibility of refunds. We can always add it
back later (with a proper set of features for all kinds of refunds) as
an optional feature.

4. This depends on the use case. The URL contains an optional invoice
ID. A payee can request a payment for a specific, single transaction
(for a single instance of delivery of goods/services) by handing over an
URL, including an invoice ID, to a single payer. This provides similar
functionality as BOLT 11, except that you now have a well-defined
channel for transmitting larger invoice descriptions and for using
partial onion routes. A payee can also hand over an URL without invoice
ID; this can be used and re-used by one or more payers, whenever they
want to perform payments to this payee.

Thanks for the questions; I think I can improve my proposal based on
your feedback.

What should I do with BOLT 12? Have it pulled in
lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc; maybe in a separate branch? Or first
work it out in more detail? How does lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc
distinguish between drafts, finished agreed-on specs and things we
decided we don't want? Is there even a consensus forming mechanism?

CJP


(*) to some degree; there are limits to the privacy provided by TOR.

(**) when extending the current BOLT 12 draft a bit, it might also
optionally be selected by the payer.

&gt;<i> Hello Corn&#233;,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm glad to see that someone getting this kind of idea started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still new to some of these topics, but I have a few comments.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully I'm not wasting your time if they are too rudimentary!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. You mention that the payee gives a URL where the payer can then
</I>&gt;<i>     connect to to request invoices. You mention that this can be a tor
</I>&gt;<i>     hidden service if the payee needs to remain private. You also
</I>&gt;<i>     suggest that the payee can remain private by &quot;payee can send an
</I>&gt;<i>     invoice to payer which has a partial onion route as destination
</I>&gt;<i>     instead of a node ID&quot;. I was reading about tor hidden services
</I>&gt;<i>     (<A HREF="https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en</A>), and they
</I>&gt;<i>     require an introduction point, and a rendezvous point. Do we not
</I>&gt;<i>     need this two step process for the payment route, because we
</I>&gt;<i>     already have communication initiated over the anonymous
</I>&gt;<i>     communication channel, and the beginning of the partial onion
</I>&gt;<i>     route is not publicly available information, and can change with
</I>&gt;<i>     every invoice?
</I>&gt;<i>  2. What happens if the capacity of the partial onion route is no
</I>&gt;<i>     longer sufficient when the payer is ready to pay? Is there a way
</I>&gt;<i>     to provide a few routes just in case? Or, in the case where no
</I>&gt;<i>     amount is specified, how is the partial onion route possible if we
</I>&gt;<i>     don't even know how much capacity may be needed?
</I>&gt;<i>  3. You say the refund should invalidate the proof of payment of the
</I>&gt;<i>     initial transaction. What about partial refunds? I think there are
</I>&gt;<i>     a lot of applications where there would be a partial refund.
</I>&gt;<i>  4. You say &quot;this BOLT specifies a protocol where payee gives a URL to
</I>&gt;<i>     one or more potential payers&quot;. How does the payer identify itself
</I>&gt;<i>     to the payee so that the payee knows what goods or services that
</I>&gt;<i>     they want an invoice for? Do they send this after making the
</I>&gt;<i>     connection, or is it part of the URL?
</I>&gt;<i>
