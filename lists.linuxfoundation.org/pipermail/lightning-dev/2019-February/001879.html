I've been thinking about this as 'the yalls problem'.  But it is has
similarities to recurring payments and bolt11 &quot;offers&quot;, where you also
have to do an interaction to get the real invoice.

To recap: yalls currently asks you to produce a valid invoice which it
will then pay.  It covers fees (presumably up to some limit).  But it's
a manual and messy process.

At the summit, Takaya Imai proposed a standard mechanism for such a
&quot;pull an invoice&quot; request.  I now see his wisdom; sorry for the delay!

So we need a web way of asking a client to send an invoice or offer over
HTTPS.  Is this a new URI scheme?  How would this work?

Longer term, we need a format for bolt11 offers (lno1...?); kind of a
template for the real invoice(s) which you would fetch, and a new
message type so you can route these requests through the lightning
network.  This would give us an &quot;automated payment&quot; mechanism, too: you
would provide this once and yalls could do automatic payouts by
requesting a new invoice though LN itself.

Cheers,
Rusty.
