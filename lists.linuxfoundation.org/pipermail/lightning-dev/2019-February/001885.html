&gt;<i> Good morning Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So we need a web way of asking a client to send an invoice or offer over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTTPS. Is this a new URI scheme? How would this work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that offers would work over LN alone?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you first proposed the offers, I thought it was this way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Payee gives BOLT12 offer to Payer.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Payer generates a completely new random preimage and computes its hash.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Payer issues a payment along an LN route from Payer to Payee using its random hash.
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  At the payee hop, the onion packet contains some identifying information from the BOLT12 offer.
</I>&gt;<i> 5.  Payee generates a BOLT11 invoice.
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  Payee sends back an error packet, which includes the BOLT11 invoice.
</I>&gt;<i> 7.  Payer receives the error packet that includes the BOLT11 invoice.
</I>&gt;<i> 8.  Payer pays using the BOLT11 invoice.
</I>
Yes.  But how does the payee know to give the bolt12 offer to the payer?

That's the piece that's missing here, which is actually independent.

&gt;<i> Intermediate nodes remain unaware of this new feature and do not require upgrades.
</I>
That works if we use a fake &quot;payment&quot; like this to get the real invoice.
Be nicer to use a real message format though, as it's less overhead for
everyone and faster.

&gt;<i> A node issuing a BOLT12 offer would implicitly signal its support for this feature by the simple fact of being able to issue the BOLT12 offer.
</I>&gt;<i> A node that can understand a BOLT12 offer implicitly means it supports this feature.
</I>
Yes; I think it's early enough that we don't need to cram offers into
bolt11 in some backwards compat way, they can be a new thing.

Cheers,
Rusty.
