<PRE>Hi y'all,

Recently we've started to do more design work related to the Sphinx packet
(EOB format, rendezvous protocol). This prompted me to re-visit the original
Sphinx paper to refresh my memory w.r.t some of the finer details of the
protocol.  While I was re-reading the paper, I realized that we may be able
to use use SURBs (single-use-reply-blocks) to implement a &quot;payment ACK&quot; for
each sent HTLC.

(it's worth mentioning that switching to HORNET down the line would solve
this problem as well since the receiver already gets a multi-use backwards
route that they can use to send information back to the receiver)

Right now HTLC routing is mainly a game of &quot;send and hope it arrives&quot;, as
you have no clear indication of the _arrival_ of an HTLC at the destination.
Instead, you only receive a protocol level message if the HTLC failed for
w/e reason, or if it was successfully redeemed.  As part of BOLT 1.1, it was
agreed upon that we should implement some sort of &quot;payment ACK&quot; feature. A
payment ACK scheme is strongly desired as it:

  * Allows the sender to actually know when a payment has reached the
    receiver which is useful for many higher level protocols. Atm, the
    sender is unable to distinguish an HTLC being &quot;black holed&quot; from one
    that's actually reached the sender, and they're just holding on to it.
  * AMP implementations would be aided by being able to receive feedback on
    successfully routed splits. If we're able to have the receiver ACK each
    partial payment, then implementations can more aggressively split
    payments as they're able to gain assurance that the first 2 BTC of 5
    total have actually reached the sender, and weren't black holed.
  * Enforcing and relying on ACKs may also thwart silly games receivers
    might play, claiming that the HTLC &quot;didn't actually arrive&quot;.

Some also call this feature a &quot;soft error&quot; as a possible implementation
might to re-use the existing onion error protocol we've deployed today.  For
reference, in order to send back errors back long the route in a way that
doesn't reveal the sender of the HTLC to the receiver (or any of the
intermediate nodes) we re-use the shared secret each hop has derived, and
onion wrap a MAC'd error to the sender. Each hop can't actually check that
they've received a well formed error, but the sender is able to attribute an
error to a node in the route based on which shared secret they're able to
check the MAC with.

The original Sphinx packet format has a way for the receiver to send a
message back to the sender. This was originally envisioned to allow the
receiver to send a replay email/message back to the sender without knowing
who they were, and also in a manner that was bit-wise indistinguishable from
a regular forwarded packet. This is called a SURB or &quot;single use reply
block&quot;. A SURB is composed of: a pre-crafted sphinx packet for the
&quot;backwards route&quot; (which can be distinct from the forwards route), the first
hop of the backwards route, and finally a symmetric key to use when
encrypting the reply.

When we more or less settled on using Sphinx, we started to remove things
that we didn't have a clear use for at the time. Two things that were
removed were the original end-to-end payload, and also the SURB. Removing
the payload made the packet size smaller, and it didn't seem realistic to
give _each_ hop a SURB to send reply back.

In order to implement payment ACKs, we can have the sender craft a SURB (for
the ACK), and mark the receipt of the SURB as the payment ACK itself.
Creating and processing a SURB is identical to the regular HTLC packets we
use today. As a result, the code impact to the code sphinx packet logic is
minimal. We'd then also re-introduce the e2e payload so we can carry the
SURB in the forward direction (HLTC add). The backwards packet would also
have a payload of random bytes with the same size as a regular packet to
make them look identical on the wire.

This payload can further be put to use in order to implement streaming or
subscription payments in a way. Since we must add a payload for in order to
send/reply look the same, we can also piggy back some useful additional
data. Each time a payment is sent, the receiver can use the extra payload to
stack on details such as:
  * A new invoice to pay for the metered service being paid for.
  * An invoice along with a deadline for when this must be paid, lest the
    subscription service expire.
  * Details of lightning-native API
  * etc, etc

IMO, this approach is better than a potential client-server payment
negotiation protocol as it doesn't require any additional servers along side
the node, also maintains sender anonymity, and doesn't rely on any sort of
PKI.

&gt;<i>From the prospective of packet-analysis, errors today are identifiable due
</I>to the packet size (though we do pad them out to avoid being able to
distinguish some errors from others on the wide). SURBs on the other hand,
have the same profile as regular HTLC adds since they use the same Sphinx
packet format.  Unlike the wrapped onion errors, intermediate nodes are also
able to validate the integrity of the payment ACK as they'll check the
per-hop
MAC as normal. Additionally, the replies naturally create cover traffic as
they look like regular payments.

One down side is that this would essentially double the size of HTLC
messages on the network today, as they need to also carry SURB.  Most
candidates for possible rendezvous schemes to deploy would also increase the
packet size if up to 20 hops it be allowed in both directions.  We also
(from my PoV), don't really have a feel on how much of an issue the 1.2KB
HTLC packet size is today in the network.

By re-introducing SURBs, we have an opportunity to cleanly solve the payment
ACK issue, re-use a component of our favorite thing in Lightning, enable
protocol-level streaming/subscription payments and also make replies
indistinguishable-ish from regular payments.

Thoughts?
