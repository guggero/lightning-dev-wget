&gt;<i> Hi y'all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently we've started to do more design work related to the Sphinx packet
</I>&gt;<i> (EOB format, rendezvous protocol). This prompted me to re-visit the original
</I>&gt;<i> Sphinx paper to refresh my memory w.r.t some of the finer details of the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.  While I was re-reading the paper, I realized that we may be able
</I>&gt;<i> to use use SURBs (single-use-reply-blocks) to implement a &quot;payment ACK&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> each sent HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (it's worth mentioning that switching to HORNET down the line would solve
</I>&gt;<i> this problem as well since the receiver already gets a multi-use backwards
</I>&gt;<i> route that they can use to send information back to the receiver)
</I>
I think HORNET is a better way forward for soft errors, since using the
same circuit is *way* more reliable (Christian indicated most probe
failures are due to disconnected nodes, not capacity).

I'd like to see us work towards that instead, at least in baby steps.

&gt;<i> Right now HTLC routing is mainly a game of &quot;send and hope it arrives&quot;, as
</I>&gt;<i> you have no clear indication of the _arrival_ of an HTLC at the destination.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, you only receive a protocol level message if the HTLC failed for
</I>&gt;<i> w/e reason, or if it was successfully redeemed.  As part of BOLT 1.1, it was
</I>&gt;<i> agreed upon that we should implement some sort of &quot;payment ACK&quot; feature. A
</I>&gt;<i> payment ACK scheme is strongly desired as it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Allows the sender to actually know when a payment has reached the
</I>&gt;<i>     receiver which is useful for many higher level protocols. Atm, the
</I>&gt;<i>     sender is unable to distinguish an HTLC being &quot;black holed&quot; from one
</I>&gt;<i>     that's actually reached the sender, and they're just holding on to it.
</I>
Agreed, though in the long run we'll have to do something about that.

&gt;<i>   * AMP implementations would be aided by being able to receive feedback on
</I>&gt;<i>     successfully routed splits. If we're able to have the receiver ACK each
</I>&gt;<i>     partial payment, then implementations can more aggressively split
</I>&gt;<i>     payments as they're able to gain assurance that the first 2 BTC of 5
</I>&gt;<i>     total have actually reached the sender, and weren't black holed.
</I>
Yes, I suspect this will quickly get messy.  Sender wants longer
timeouts for AMP, network definitely doesn't.  In my current draft I
chose 60 seconds for the timeout, but that's a compromise.

&gt;<i>   * Enforcing and relying on ACKs may also thwart silly games receivers
</I>&gt;<i>     might play, claiming that the HTLC &quot;didn't actually arrive&quot;.
</I>
And general debugging and diag as the network gets larger.

&gt;<i> Some also call this feature a &quot;soft error&quot; as a possible implementation
</I>&gt;<i> might to re-use the existing onion error protocol we've deployed today.  For
</I>&gt;<i> reference, in order to send back errors back long the route in a way that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't reveal the sender of the HTLC to the receiver (or any of the
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes) we re-use the shared secret each hop has derived, and
</I>&gt;<i> onion wrap a MAC'd error to the sender. Each hop can't actually check that
</I>&gt;<i> they've received a well formed error, but the sender is able to attribute an
</I>&gt;<i> error to a node in the route based on which shared secret they're able to
</I>&gt;<i> check the MAC with.
</I>
Either way, someone should spec that :)

Cheers,
Rusty.
