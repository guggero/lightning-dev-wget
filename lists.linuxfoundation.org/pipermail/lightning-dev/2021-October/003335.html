<PRE>Good morning Joost,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good morning Joost,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A potential downside of a dedicated probe message is that it could be used for free messaging on lightning by including additional data in the payload for the recipient. Free messaging is already possible today via htlcs, but a probe message would lower the cost to do so because the sender doesn't need to lock up liquidity for it. This probably increases the spam potential. I am wondering if it is possible to design the probe message so that it is useless for anything other than probing. I guess it is hard because it would still have that obfuscated 1300 bytes block with the remaining part of the route in it and nodes can't see whether there is other meaningful data at the end.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the probe, the onion max size does not *need* to be 1300, we could reduce the size to make it less useable for *remote* messaging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, maybe it can be reduced a bit. But if we want to support 27 hops like we do for payments, there will be quite some space left for messaging on real routes which are mostly much shorter.
</I>
Does six degrees of separation not apply for the LN?
I assume it would --- presumably some mathist can actually check the actual network diameter?

In particular, forwarding nodes have an incentive to shorten the degree of separation, at least to popular nodes, by building channels to those, so I presume the degrees of separation will remain low.
I expect something like 10 hops would work reasonably well...?

(Longer routes greatly compound their expected failure rate as well, so no reasonable payer would prefer longer routes if a shorter route would do)

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj
