<PRE>Hi,

I'm writing a report to disclose specification-level vulnerabilities
affecting the Lightning implementations.

The vulnerabilities are expected to be patched in:
* Eclair: v0.6.2+ (CVE-2021-41591)
* LND: v0.13.3+ (CVE-2021-41592)
* LDK: v0.0.102 (not released as production software yet)

The vulnerabilities are also affecting c-lightning (CVE-2021-41593).

Those vulnerabilities can be exploited in a wide range of attacks, going
from fee blackmailing of node operators, burning liquidity of your
competing LSPs or even stealing your counterparty channel balance if you
avail mining capabilities. Exercise of the vulnerability revealed that a
majority of the balance funds can be at loss.

Credit to Eugene Siegel (Crypt-iQ) for reporting the trimmed-to-dust
exploitation and multiple insights about attacks.

Thanks to Bastien Teinturier and Matt Corallo for numerous contributions
about mitigations development.

# Problem

The current BOLT specification only requires Alice's `dust_limit_satoshis`
(applied on Alice's commitment) to be under Alice's
`channel_reserve_satoshis` (applied on Bob). As those 2 parameters are
selectable by Alice, she can inflate the dust limit until reaching the
implementation-defined max value (e.g LND: 20% of chan capacity, LDK: 100%
of chan capacity).

Any in-flight incoming HTLC under Alice's dust limit will be converted as
miner fees on Alice's commitment. This HTLC is deducted from Bob's balance
and as such they're still owned by Bob, until resolution (i.e a RAA
removing the HTLC from Alice's commitment). This limitation only applies
per-HTLC. No implementation enforces a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs
burned as fees. Therefore, Alice is free to inflict a substantial loss to
Bob funds by publishing her commitment on-chain.

In-flight outgoing HTLC are also committed as fees on Bob's commitment if
they're under Bob's threshold. Alice can also exploit from this angle by
circular routing HTLCs until reaching Bob's
`max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`. Alice withholds HTLCs resolution until Bob
goes on-chain to timeout an offered HTLC or claim an accepted HTLC.

Dust HTLC processing can be also exploited at `update_fee` reception.

As the BOLT3's fees computation encompasses the negotiated feerate from
`update_fee` for the 2nd-stage HTLC fees to decide if the HTLC must be
trimmed, the amount of balance at risk is a function of current mempool
feerates.

The maximum of funds at risk on a counterparty commitment is:

counterparty's `max_accepted_htlcs` * (`htlc_success_tx_kw` * opener's
`feerate_per_kw` + counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis`) + holder's
`max_accepted_htlcs` * (`htlc_timeout_tx_kw` * opener's `feerate_per_kw` +
counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis`)

If the opener is also the attacker, the negotiated feerate can be
manipulated beyond the &quot;honest&quot; mempool feerates only upper bounded
implementation-defined value (before fixes, LDK: 2 * high-feerate of our
fee-estimator). If the opener is the victim, the negotiated feerate is
still a safety concern in case of spontaneous mempool spikes.

Note, `anchors_zero_htlc_fee` channels are not affected by the feerate
inflation as the trimmed-to-dust fee computation mechanism for 2nd-stage
HTLC is removed. They're still at risk of the sum of the HTLCs under the
dust limit being maliciously burned.

# Solution

A first mitigation is to verify the counterparty's announced
`dust_limit_satoshis` at channel opening (`open_channel`/`accept_channel`)
reception and reject if it's estimated too large (see #894)

For LDK, we choose the value of 660 satoshis as it's beyond the highest
dust threshold enforced by Bitcoin Core (p2pkh: 546) with a margin of
safety. Propagation of Lightning time-sensitive transactions shouldn't be
affected.

A second mitigation is to define a new configurable limit
`max_dust_htlc_exposure` and apply this one at incoming and outgoing of
HTLC.

For LDK, we choose the value of 5 000 000 milli-satoshis as we gauged this
value as a substantial loss for our class of users. Setting this too low
may prevent the sending or receipt of low-value HTLCs on high-traffic
nodes. A node operator should fine-tune this value in function of what
qualifies as an acceptable loss.

We would like to ensure that the node isn't suddenly exposed to
significantly more trimmed balance if the feerate increases when we have
several HTLCs pending which are near the dust limit.

To achieve this goal, we introduce a new `dust_buffer_feerate` defined as
the maximum of either 2530 sats per kWU or 125% of the current
`feerate_per_kw` (implementation-defined values).

Then, upon an incoming HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount_msat` is inferior to the
counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis` plus the HTLC-timeout fee at the
`dust_buffer_feerate`. If the `amount_msat` plus the
`dust_balance_on_counterparty_tx` is superior to `max_dust_htlc_exposure`,
the HTLC should be failed once it's committed.

Upon an outgoing HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount_msat` is inferior to the
counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis`  plus the HTLC-success fee at the
`dust_buffer_feerate`. If the `amount_msat` plus the
`dust_balance_on_counterparty_tx` is superior to `max_dust_htlc_exposure`,
the HTLC should not be sent and fail without forwarding.

The check symmetry must also be applied on holder commitment transactions.
See PR #919 for more details.

A last mitigation is ensuring that at `update_fee` reception, the pending
`dust_balance` at the new proposed feerate isn't superior to
`max_dust_htlc_exposure_msat`.

# Background

The dust limit is a base layer policy stopping the relay of a transaction
if one of its outputs is under a given threshold. The goal of this policy
is to prevent the pollution of the UTXO set with low-value outputs and as
such increase the amount of work done by full-nodes.

Lightning commitment transactions should be able to propagate at any point
during the channel lifetime to unilaterally enforce on-chain a balance. A
Lightning commitment transaction with one of its outputs below the dust
limit would fail to relay and thus jeopardizes funds safety.

To prevent this, BOLT2 requires counterparties to announce a
`dust_limit_satoshis` during channel opening (at
`open_channel`/`accept_channel` exchange). This `dust_limit_satoshis` must
be under the same party's `channel_reserve_satoshis`. This value is static
for the channel lifetime.

During commitment signatures exchange, each counterparty's limit is applied
on each counterparty's commitment (e.g A's `dust_limit_satoshis` is applied
on A's commitment, though both A and B have to generate and sign the
transaction). An output below this limit is trimmed to fees and won't
materialize on the commitment.

The specification didn't require that the `open_channel`/`accept_channel`
receiver verify that the announced `dust_limit_satoshis` isn't too large.

The specification didn't require that the sum of the dust HTLC committed as
fees was verified against an upper bound.

# Discovery

Vulnerabilities around our dust HTLC processing have been known for years
by some LN developers/researchers.

During Q1 2019, private discussions on the Rust-Lightning-side (LDK before
marketing rebranding) about potential safety risks around dust HTLC
processing.

In November 2019, Rusty Russell (c-lightning) opened an issue against the
specification mentioning the lack of check of counterparty's dust limit
(#696).

In May 2020, I published a high-level attack scenario &quot;Miners Dust
Inflation attacks on Lightning Network&quot;, leveraging this lack.

In February 2021, I did a test of the first vulnerability against LND
software and successfully burnt the majority of the targeted node balance
in fees. As it sounds to me like a check missing in the specification, I
notified CL/LND/Eclair/LDK maintainers. Mitigations started to be developed
on the LDK-side.

In July 2021, in the context of `option_dusty_htlcs_uncounted` discussions,
Eugene Spiegel (LND) reported on how to exploit the trimmed-to-dust
mechanism at `update_fee` reception. Discussions followed on the best way
to mitigate this new vector.

During August 2021, mitigations were developed and released on the
LDK-side. vulnerabilities were disclosed to other Lightning projects (Muun
wallet, Electrum). From the LDK-side, a public disclosure date was proposed.

Still during August 2021, the Bitcoin Core dust limit was actively
discussed on the mailing list. Changes of this dust limit would have
affected the ongoing development of the mitigations.

While this report highlights the lack of well-defined communication process
across Lightning teams,  developers from 3 different implementations have
actively participated in the vulnerabilities diagnostic and mitigations
development of those long-standing specification issues affecting the whole
Lightning ecosystem.

All mistakes and opinions are my own and please verify any information
reported.
