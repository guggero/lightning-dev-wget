</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Use two hashes in an HTLC instead of one, where the second hash is from a preimage the sender generates, and which the sender sends (encrypted via onion) to the receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You might want to do this anyway in HTLC-land, consider that we have a `payment_secret` in invoices, the second hash could replace that, and provide similar protection to what `payment_secret` provides (i.e. resistance against forwarding nodes probing; the information in both cases is private to the ultimate sender and ultimate reeceiver).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you could create a construction which does this, sure, but I'm not sure how you'd do this
</I>&gt;<i> without informing every hop along the path that this is going on, and adapting each hop to handle
</I>&gt;<i> this as well. I suppose I should have been more clear with the requirements, or can you clarify
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat what your proposed construction is?
</I>
Just that: two hashes instead of one.
Make *every* HTLC on LN use two hashes, even for current &quot;online RPi user pays online RPi user&quot; --- just use the `payment_secret` for the preimage of the second hash, the sender needs to send it anyway.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're gonna adapt every node in the path, you might as well just use PTLC.
</I>
Correct, we should just do PTLCs now.
(Basically, my proposal was just a strawman to say &quot;we should just do PTLCs now&quot;)
