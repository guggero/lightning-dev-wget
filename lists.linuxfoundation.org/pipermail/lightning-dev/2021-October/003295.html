This may model closer to &quot;two tits for a tat&quot; strategy.

&quot;Tit for tat&quot; is optimum in iterated prisoner dilemma assuming mistakes never happen; however, in the real world we know quite well that we may injure another person by complete accident.
The usual practice in the real world is that the injured person will accept an apology *once*, but a repeat will tend to make people assume you are hostile and switch them over to tit for tat.
This overall strategy is then &quot;two tits for a tat&quot;, you are (in practice) given one chance and then you are expected to be very careful in interacting with that person to keep being in their good graces.

So, if what you propose is widespread, then a theft attempt is costless: you can try using old state, and your victim will, on finding it, instead just use what they think is the latest state.
Thus, merely attempting the theft is costless (modulo onchain fees, which may be enough punishment in this case?).

However, if we assume that in practice a lot of &quot;theft attempts&quot; are really people not taking RAID systems and database replication seriously and getting punished by the trickster god Murphy, then your proposal would actually be better, and if theft is unlikely enough to succeed, then even a costless theft attempt would still be worthless (and onchain fees will bite you anyway).
