<PRE>Hi SomberNight,

I started a similar discussion less than a year ago on the list. The idea I
put forward works fine with MuSig and taproot.

<A HREF="../2020-December/002907.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-December/002907.html</A>

The idea was considered for channel establishment v2 but in the end there
were various objections to it becoming specified as it forces
implementations to handle keys in a certain way. You can still do it
informally though by fixing your funding pubkey to be derived from the
Diffie-Hellman key of the two node ids. This makes the funding public keys
a (secret) deterministic function of the two node ids without making a
privacy leak.

FWIW I still think this is a good idea but in hindsight I think the
objections to it being mandatory are valid.

Cheers,

LL

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TL;DR: an approach is described how to derive channel keys
</I>&gt;<i> deterministically that allows certain forms of recovery from just
</I>&gt;<i> a seed, that works today. This approach however will no longer work
</I>&gt;<i> with e.g. MuSig key aggregation in the future. An idea for a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is given how the channel-open flow (e.g. as part of channel v2) could be
</I>&gt;<i> changed to make a similar approach work independent of key aggregation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While implementing anchor output support in Electrum, we have realised
</I>&gt;<i> one difficulty is to do with the remote-force-close case where the
</I>&gt;<i> to_remote output is no longer a simple p2wpkh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, pre-anchor-support, Electrum sets option_static_remotekey
</I>&gt;<i> to required (feature bit 12), and we restrict lightning usage to wallets
</I>&gt;<i> that derive p2wpkh addresses, and payment_basepoint is set
</I>&gt;<i> to a bip32-derived pubkey that corresponds to a wallet address.
</I>&gt;<i> Hence, if a user were to restore from seed words, and their channel
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty force closed their channel, the to_remote output of the
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast commitment tx would directly pay to the user's wallet.
</I>&gt;<i> That is, in many typical scenarios, funds are not lost when restoring
</I>&gt;<i> from seed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Also, if we are the channel-funder/opener, it is easy to find the
</I>&gt;<i> funding transaction, just by testing txs in the wallet history.
</I>&gt;<i> Further, for the cases we are the channel-funder/opener,
</I>&gt;<i> there is a setting to put an OP_RETURN in the funding tx, which stores
</I>&gt;<i> the nodeid of the counterparty, allowing us to identify who to contact
</I>&gt;<i> to get the channel closed.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, we are (ab)using dataloss_protect to ask the remote
</I>&gt;<i> to force-close when restoring from seed, so the user does not even have
</I>&gt;<i> to wait for an arbitrarily long time.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With anchors, the to_remote is now a p2wsh that involves a CSV,
</I>&gt;<i> and we cannot easily make this script correspond to a wallet address,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. we lose the property that the remote-force-close pays directly
</I>&gt;<i> to a wallet address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the problem we would like to solve, is:
</I>&gt;<i> - having seed words
</I>&gt;<i> - having access to blockchain data
</I>&gt;<i> - somehow having identified our channel counterparties (node IDs),
</I>&gt;<i>   and our channels with them (funding outpoints)
</I>&gt;<i> - and assuming we can get the remote to do a force-close
</I>&gt;<i> --&gt; we would like to be able to spend the to_remote output
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Naively, we could just derive a static key to be used as
</I>&gt;<i> payment_basepoint, reused between all our channels, and watch the
</I>&gt;<i> single resulting p2wsh script on-chain.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly this has terrible privacy implications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Or, we could derive a new bip32 chain/sequence of pubkeys
</I>&gt;<i> used as payment_basepoint for channels, and watch these p2wsh scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> with a gap limit.
</I>&gt;<i> Particularly the gap limit part makes this undesirable though
</I>&gt;<i> (just consider having more than &quot;gap limit&quot; channels open and restoring
</I>&gt;<i> from seed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, it seems desirable to see whether we can extract some entropy
</I>&gt;<i> from the blockchain, and use that as a nonce to be combined with a
</I>&gt;<i> static private secret derived from our seed.
</I>&gt;<i> We could extract data either from the funding tx, or from the
</I>&gt;<i> remote-commitment-transaction that spent the funding output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) We exploit the fact that the funding output uses a
</I>&gt;<i> 2of2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG script composed of the funding pubkeys of
</I>&gt;<i> each party. The funding pubkey itself can be used as a nonce, and
</I>&gt;<i> it can be recovered from the witness of the commitment tx.
</I>&gt;<i> The privkey for payment_basepoint can then be derived as e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> hash(bip32_derive(seed, HARDCODED_PATH) + funding_pubkey).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact (3) is not novel at all: eclair has been deriving
</I>&gt;<i> all their channel keys like this [0] for some time, from
</I>&gt;<i> a static seed-based secret combined with the funding_pubkey as nonce,
</I>&gt;<i> and generating the funding_privkey from ~os.urandom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Electrum will likely use (3) at least for the payment_basepoint,
</I>&gt;<i> as part of adapting to anchors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the idea (3) relies on recovering the funding_pubkey from
</I>&gt;<i> the witness of the spending transaction, which will break in the future
</I>&gt;<i> if the funding script is changed to e.g. a p2tr that uses musig.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Crucially, note that all the approach needs is some blockchain-visible
</I>&gt;<i> nonce that is already known at the time we need to construct the
</I>&gt;<i> open_channel message (as we want to be able to derive some of the keys
</I>&gt;<i> that are sent as part of the open_channel message
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. payment_basepoint) from it).
</I>&gt;<i> As long as the funding output uses a 2of2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG,
</I>&gt;<i> the local funding_pubkey fits the bill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that irrespective of any restrictions on the script used in
</I>&gt;<i> the funding output, we could use the funding scriptPubKey/address as
</I>&gt;<i> the nonce, if the open_channel/accept_channel messages were
</I>&gt;<i> split into two.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, instead of the single round of open_channel/accept_channel,
</I>&gt;<i> there could be two rounds:
</I>&gt;<i> - an open_channel_part1, where the peers exchange only
</I>&gt;<i>   the funding_pubkey (and the other non-pubkey fields), and
</I>&gt;<i> - an open_channel_part2, where the rest of the pubkeys are sent
</I>&gt;<i> This way the peers would learn what the funding address would be after
</I>&gt;<i> the first round finishes, and could potentially use that to derive
</I>&gt;<i> their other channel keys (needed for round 2).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, to arrive at my point, I would like to ask whether people think
</I>&gt;<i> such a change - or something similar - might be useful, and if so,
</I>&gt;<i> whether it could/should be incorporated to the current
</I>&gt;<i> channel establishment v2 proposal [1].
</I>&gt;<i> If there is agreement that this would be useful, a spec change
</I>&gt;<i> would be most useful before changing the 2of2 multisig script.
