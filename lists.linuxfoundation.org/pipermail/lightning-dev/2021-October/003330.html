Thanks! 

&gt;<i> One thing to note is that the senders also need to come online while

</I>&gt;<i> not come online, the sender's LSP will have to force-close to claim the
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC on-chain when it gets close to the timeout.
</I>
Yep. I was imagining a huge CLTV on that hop (and maybe some way of having a first-hop-set CLTV at hops after that, I don&#8217;t recall if it&#8217;s allowed, but it should be for this). That way at least the sender has a week/month to go online and clear the HTLC, subject to the usual LSP liquidity requirements of course.

&gt;<i> Definitely not a show-stopper, just an implementation detail to keep in
</I>&gt;<i> mind.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Good morning Matt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      The Obvious (tm) solution here is PTLCs - just have the sender always add some random nonce * G to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      the PTLC they're paying and send the recipient a random nonce in the onion. I'd generally suggest we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      just go ahead and do this for every PTLC payment, cause why not? Now the sender and the lnurl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      endpoint have to collude to steal the funds, but, like, the sender could always just give the lnurl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      endpoint the money. I'd love suggestions for fixing this short of PTLCs, but its not immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      obvious to me that this is possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Use two hashes in an HTLC instead of one, where the second hash is from a preimage the sender generates, and which the sender sends (encrypted via onion) to the receiver.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You might want to do this anyway in HTLC-land, consider that we have a `payment_secret` in invoices, the second hash could replace that, and provide similar protection to what `payment_secret` provides (i.e. resistance against forwarding nodes probing; the information in both cases is private to the ultimate sender and ultimate reeceiver).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, you could create a construction which does this, sure, but I'm not sure how you'd do this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; without informing every hop along the path that this is going on, and adapting each hop to handle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; this as well. I suppose I should have been more clear with the requirements, or can you clarify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; somewhat what your proposed construction is?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just that: two hashes instead of one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Make *every* HTLC on LN use two hashes, even for current &quot;online RPi user pays online RPi user&quot; --- just use the `payment_secret` for the preimage of the second hash, the sender needs to send it anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If you're gonna adapt every node in the path, you might as well just use PTLC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Correct, we should just do PTLCs now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Basically, my proposal was just a strawman to say &quot;we should just do PTLCs now&quot;)
