&gt;<i> Hi Fabrice,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I believe that was a mistake: a few days ago, Arcane Research published a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; fairly detailed report on the state of the Lightning Network:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; <A HREF="https://twitter.com/ArcaneResearch/status/1445442967582302213">https://twitter.com/ArcaneResearch/status/1445442967582302213</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://twitter.com/ArcaneResearch/status/1445442967582302213">https://twitter.com/ArcaneResearch/status/1445442967582302213</A>&gt;.&#160; They
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; obviously did some real work there, and seem to imply that their report
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; was vetted by Open Node and Lightning Labs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Appreciate the hard work from Arcane on putting together this report. That
</I>&gt;<i> said, our role wasn't to review the entire report, but instead to provide
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on questions they had. Had we reviewed the section in question, we
</I>&gt;<i> would have spotted those errors and told the authors to fix them. Mistakes
</I>&gt;<i> happen, and we're glad it got corrected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also note that lnd has _never_ referred to itself as the &quot;reference&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.&#160; A few years ago some other implementations adopted that
</I>&gt;<i> title themselves, but have since adopted softer language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; So I'm proposing that lnd's source code be removed from
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/</A>&gt; (and moved to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/lightninglabs">https://github.com/lightninglabs</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/lightninglabs">https://github.com/lightninglabs</A>&gt; for example, with the rest of 
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Lightning tools, but it's up to Lightning Labs).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's worth briefly revisiting a bit of history here w.r.t the github
</I>&gt;<i> org in question. In the beginning, the lightningnetwork github org was
</I>&gt;<i> created by Joseph, and the lightningnetwork/paper repo was added, the
</I>&gt;<i> manuscript that kicked off this entire thing. Later lightningnetwork/lnd was
</I>&gt;<i> created where we started to work on an initial implementation (before the
</I>&gt;<i> BOLTs in their current form existed), and we were added as owners.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually we (devs of current impls) all met up in Milan and decided to
</I>&gt;<i> converge on a single specification, thus we added the BOLTs to the same
</I>&gt;<i> repo, despite it being used for lnd and knowingly so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We purposefully made a _new_ lightninglabs github org as we wanted to keep
</I>&gt;<i> lnd, the implementation distinct from any of our future commercial
</I>&gt;<i> products/services. To this day, we've architected all our paid products to
</I>&gt;<i> be built _on top_ of lnd, rather than within it. As a result, users always
</I>&gt;<i> opt into these services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As it seems the primary grievance here is collocating an implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning along with the _specification_ of the protocol, and given that the
</I>&gt;<i> spec was added last, how about we move the spec to an independent repo owned
</I>&gt;<i> by the community? I currently have github.com/lightning &lt;<A HREF="http://github.com/lightning">http://github.com/lightning</A>&gt;, and would be 
</I>&gt;<i> happy
</I>&gt;<i> to donate it to the community, or we could create a new org like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lightning-specs&quot; or something similar. We could then move the spec (the
</I>&gt;<i> BOLTs and also potentially the bLIPs since some devs want it to be within
</I>&gt;<i> its own repo) there, and have it be the home for any other
</I>&gt;<i> community-backed/owned projects.&#160; I think the creation of a new github
</I>&gt;<i> organization would also be a good opportunity to further formalize the set
</I>&gt;<i> of stakeholders and the general process related to the evolution of
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning the protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>
No super strong opinion on where things end up, but roughly agree they should be separate. In other 
words, this proposal sounds good to me, want to set it up?

Matt
