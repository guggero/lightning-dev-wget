Yes, but not just locked, just &quot;doesn't have the lightning app open and in the foreground when a 
payment comes in&quot;.  See this paragraph:

&gt;<i>      &#160; &#160; Several lightning apps do this today, and its somewhat of a stop-gap but does help. On
</I>&gt;<i>     platforms
</I>&gt;<i>     where the app gets some meager CPU time in response to a notification, this can even fully solve
</I>&gt;<i>     the
</I>&gt;<i>     problem by claiming the HTLC in response to the notification pushed out-of-band. Sadly, the refrain
</I>&gt;<i>     I've heard repeatedly is, these days, on both Android and especially iOS, you can't even rely on a
</I>&gt;<i>     microsecond of CPU time in response to a notification. The OS fully expects your app to run code
</I>&gt;<i>     only when its on and in the foreground, unless you're a VoIP app you're screwed. Relying on the
</I>&gt;<i>     user
</I>&gt;<i>     to open the app immediately when they receive a notification is...fine, I guess, absent a better
</I>&gt;<i>     idea it seems like the best we've got today, but I'm not sure you'd find a UX designer who would
</I>&gt;<i>     *suggest* this :).
