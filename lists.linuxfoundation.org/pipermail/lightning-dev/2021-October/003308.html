<PRE>Hello Matt, can you clarify what you mean with this particular paragraph?:

But for some reason those pesky users keep wanting to use lightning for
&gt;<i> tips, or at least accept
</I>&gt;<i> payment on their phones without keeping them unlocked with the lightning
</I>&gt;<i> app open on the foreground
</I>&gt;<i> 24/7.
</I>

So the use case here is more narrow? You mean that the recipient is a
mobile user that has his phone locked?
Just so I understand better what the problem is.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a few things live today which make progress towards this goal, but
</I>&gt;<i> don't quite get there
</I>&gt;<i> (and mostly aren't trying to solve this problem, but are worth mentioning):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * just have the recipient use a custodial product/run a full lightning

</I>&gt;<i>     Obviously this has some pretty substantial drawbacks, I'm not sure I

</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;just require the recipient use a custodial service&quot; is what Twitter
</I>&gt;<i> ended up shipping with for
</I>&gt;<i> lightning tipping, and we should all probably feel ashamed that they felt
</I>&gt;<i> the need to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Blockstream Greenlight.
</I>&gt;<i>     This change the online-requirements model - with the keys on your
</I>&gt;<i> phone/elsewhere you still have
</I>&gt;<i> to have your phone online with the same requirements as running a full
</I>&gt;<i> lightning node. It just means
</I>&gt;<i> fewer resources on that device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * use keysend/AMP/whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>     This is great for tips, but only half the story. Sender goes to send a
</I>&gt;<i> keysend payment, gets to
</I>&gt;<i> one hop before the recipient, and then a day later the recipient comes
</I>&gt;<i> online to find the payment
</I>&gt;<i> long-since timed out and failed backwards. Or you could use a long CLTV on
</I>&gt;<i> the payment to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> the recipient has time to claim it, which is basically a DoS on the
</I>&gt;<i> lightning network's capacity,
</I>&gt;<i> one that may eventually be fixed, breaking your payments, and which is
</I>&gt;<i> just generally antisocial.
</I>&gt;<i> Still, my understanding is some folks do this today cause its the only
</I>&gt;<i> option for a mobile device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * lnurl
</I>&gt;<i>     ...is a great way to get an invoice, presumably from a trusted LSP for
</I>&gt;<i> the recipient, trusting
</I>&gt;<i> them to not give the same invoice twice, but doesn't help the recipient
</I>&gt;<i> receive the payment, they
</I>&gt;<i> still need to be online, unless...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * have a fully-trusted LSP that accepts payments and forwards them later
</I>&gt;<i>     this is also fine, where its practical, I guess, but I'd hope we can
</I>&gt;<i> do better. Worse, as far as
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the places where this is practical are becoming fewer and
</I>&gt;<i> fewer as the regulatory
</I>&gt;<i> uncertainty clears and everyone realizes the regulatory overhead of this
</I>&gt;<i> is...well you might as well
</I>&gt;<i> start applying for that banking charter now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * have an untrusted LSP that sends you a notification to open the app
</I>&gt;<i> when a payment is received
</I>&gt;<i>     Several lightning apps do this today, and its somewhat of a stop-gap
</I>&gt;<i> but does help. On platforms
</I>&gt;<i> where the app gets some meager CPU time in response to a notification,
</I>&gt;<i> this can even fully solve the
</I>&gt;<i> problem by claiming the HTLC in response to the notification pushed
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-band. Sadly, the refrain
</I>&gt;<i> I've heard repeatedly is, these days, on both Android and especially iOS,
</I>&gt;<i> you can't even rely on a
</I>&gt;<i> microsecond of CPU time in response to a notification. The OS fully
</I>&gt;<i> expects your app to run code
</I>&gt;<i> only when its on and in the foreground, unless you're a VoIP app you're
</I>&gt;<i> screwed. Relying on the user
</I>&gt;<i> to open the app immediately when they receive a notification is...fine, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess, absent a better
</I>&gt;<i> idea it seems like the best we've got today, but I'm not sure you'd find a
</I>&gt;<i> UX designer who would
</I>&gt;<i> *suggest* this :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what would it take to do better? What follows is a simple straw-man,
</I>&gt;<i> but something that's
</I>&gt;<i> borderline practical today and may at least generate a few ideas. It comes
</I>&gt;<i> in two variants
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we accept the lnurl trust model of &quot;a third-party I can give a list of
</I>&gt;<i> pre-signed invoices, which
</I>&gt;<i> I trust to never provide an invoice twice, but otherwise is untrusted&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> then we could do something
</I>&gt;<i> like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 1. Tipper gets an invoice from the lnurl endpoint they wish to pay,
</I>&gt;<i> which contains some
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;recipient is behind an LSP and rarely online, act accordingly&quot; flag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 2. Tipper sender sends a HTLC with a long CLTV timeout to their own
</I>&gt;<i> LSP with instructions
</I>&gt;<i> saying &quot;when you get an onion message telling you nonce B, forward this
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC, until then, just sit
</I>&gt;<i> on it&quot;. The LSP accepts this HTLC but does not forward it and is generally
</I>&gt;<i> okay with the long CLTV
</I>&gt;<i> delta because it would otherwise just be the users' balance anyway - if
</I>&gt;<i> they want to encumber their
</I>&gt;<i> own funds forever, no harm done.
</I>&gt;<i>    Note that if tipper is online regularly they can skip this step and
</I>&gt;<i> move on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 3. The Tipper sends an onion message to recipient's LSP saying &quot;hey,
</I>&gt;<i> when recipient is online
</I>&gt;<i> again, use the included reply path to send nonce B to my LSP&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - sender can now safely go offline -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 4. When the Recipient comes online, their LSP sends the reply to the
</I>&gt;<i> Tipper's LSP,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 5. causing the Tipper's LSP to (finally) forward the original HTLC,
</I>&gt;<i> which the Recipient receives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'll note that this solution, unlike simply sending a high-CLTV HTLC,
</I>&gt;<i> does not encumber funds for
</I>&gt;<i> any extended period of time except for the original sender, who wants to
</I>&gt;<i> send the funds off
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere anyway. Nor does it rely on any parties who can at any point run
</I>&gt;<i> away with the funds (or
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably be construed as custodians for the funds). Further, this
</I>&gt;<i> solution does not rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> sender deanonymizing themselves to the recipient (or even informing the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient who the senders'
</I>&gt;<i> LSP is).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that lnurl here could be replaced with BOLT 12 if BOLT 12 gets some
</I>&gt;<i> flag indicating the Tipper
</I>&gt;<i> should ask an LSP for the invoice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, okay, so the lnurl model of a trusted party not reusing invoices so
</I>&gt;<i> that the Recipient's LSP
</I>&gt;<i> cannot just steal all funds after the first claim kinda really sucks, how
</I>&gt;<i> do we do better?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Obvious (tm) solution here is PTLCs - just have the sender always add
</I>&gt;<i> some random nonce * G to
</I>&gt;<i> the PTLC they're paying and send the recipient a random nonce in the
</I>&gt;<i> onion. I'd generally suggest we
</I>&gt;<i> just go ahead and do this for every PTLC payment, cause why not? Now the
</I>&gt;<i> sender and the lnurl
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint have to collude to steal the funds, but, like, the sender could
</I>&gt;<i> always just give the lnurl
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint the money. I'd love suggestions for fixing this short of PTLCs,
</I>&gt;<i> but its not immediately
</I>&gt;<i> obvious to me that this is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Steve for pushing on the &quot;how does a let users get tips in
</I>&gt;<i> lightning&quot; issue, various
</I>&gt;<i> people for giving him feedback and the relayed to me, AJ for the PTLC
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, and Rusty for
</I>&gt;<i> tireless drum-beating on onion messages and BOLT 12.
