I don't remember that but if you're referring to c-lightning it was
the first lightning implementation, and the only one for a while, so
in a way it was a &quot;reference&quot; at the time ?
Or it could have been a reference to their policy of &quot;implementing the
spec, all the spec and nothing but the spec&quot;  ?

&gt;<i> I think it's worth briefly revisiting a bit of history here w.r.t the github
</I>&gt;<i> org in question. In the beginning, the lightningnetwork github org was
</I>&gt;<i> created by Joseph, and the lightningnetwork/paper repo was added, the
</I>&gt;<i> manuscript that kicked off this entire thing. Later lightningnetwork/lnd was
</I>&gt;<i> created where we started to work on an initial implementation (before the
</I>&gt;<i> BOLTs in their current form existed), and we were added as owners.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually we (devs of current impls) all met up in Milan and decided to
</I>&gt;<i> converge on a single specification, thus we added the BOLTs to the same
</I>&gt;<i> repo, despite it being used for lnd and knowingly so.
</I>
Yes, work on c-lightning then eclair then lnd all began a long time
before the BOLTs process was implemented, and we all set up repos,
accounts...
I agree that we all inherited things  from the &quot;pre-BOLTS&quot; era and
changing them will create some friction but I still believe it should
be done. You also mentioned potential admin rights issues on the
current specs repos which would be solved by moving them to a new
clean repo.

&gt;<i> As it seems the primary grievance here is collocating an implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning along with the _specification_ of the protocol, and given that the
</I>&gt;<i> spec was added last, how about we move the spec to an independent repo owned
</I>&gt;<i> by the community? I currently have github.com/lightning, and would be happy
</I>&gt;<i> to donate it to the community, or we could create a new org like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lightning-specs&quot; or something similar.
</I>
Sounds great! github.com/lightning is nice (and I like Damian's idea
of using github.com/lightning/bolts) and seems to please everyone so
it looks that we have a plan!
