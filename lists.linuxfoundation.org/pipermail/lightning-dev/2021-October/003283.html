</I>
The &quot;deterministic&quot; nonces are combined with &quot;recoverable&quot; nonces via
musig2, so I think that part is a red-herring?

They're &quot;deterministic&quot; in the sense that the person who generated the
nonce needs to be able to recover the secret/dlog for the nonce later,
without having to store unique randomness for it. Thinking about it,
I think you could make the &quot;deterministic&quot; nonce secrets be

   H( private-key, msg, other-party's-nonce-pair, 1 )
   H( private-key, msg, other-party's-nonce-pair, 2 )

because you only need to recover the secret if the other party posts a
sig for a revoked transaction, in which case you can lookup their nonce
directly anyway. And you're choosing your &quot;deterministic&quot; nonce after
knowing what their (&quot;revocable&quot;) nonce is, so can include it in the hash.

As far as the revocable nonce goes, you should only be generating a
single signature based on that, since that's used to finish things off
and post the tx on chain.

&gt;<i> Generally, this is insecure unless combined with heavy machinery that proves
</I>&gt;<i> correctness of the nonce derivation in zero knowledge. If one signer uses
</I>&gt;<i> deterministic nonces and another signer uses random nonces, then two signing
</I>&gt;<i> sessions will have different challenge hashes which results in nonce reuse by

</I>&gt;<i> proposal? What are the inputs to the function that derive DA1, DA2? Is the
</I>&gt;<i> assumption that a signer will not sign the same message more than once?
</I>
I had been thinking DA1,DA2 = f(seed,n) where n increases each round, but I
think the above would work and be an improvement. ie:

   Bob has a shachain based secret generator, producing secrets s_0 to
   s_(2**48). If you've seen s_0 to s_n, you only need to keep O(log(n))
   of those values to regenerate all of them.

   Bob generates RB1_n and RB2_n as H(s_n, 1)*G and H(s_n, 2)*G and sends
   those values to Alice.

   Alice determines the message (ie, the transaction), and sets da1_n
   and da2_n as H(A_priv, msg, RB1_n, RB2_n, 1) and H(A_priv, msg, RB1_n,
   RB2_n, 2). She then calculates k=H(da1_n, da2_n, RB1_n, RB2_n), and
   signs for her nonce which da1_n+k*da2_n, and sends da1_n*G and
   da2_n*G and the partial signature to Bob.

   Bob checks and records Alice's musig2 derivation and partial signature,
   but does not sign himself.

   _If_ Bob wants to close the channel and publish the tx, he completes
   the signature by signing with nonce RB1_n + k*RB2_n.

If you can convince Bob to close the channel repeatedly, using the
same nonce pair, then he'll have problems -- but if you can do that,
you can probably trick him into closing the channel with old state,
which gives him the same problems by design... Or that's my take.

&gt;<i> It may be worth pointing out that an adaptor signature scheme can not treat
</I>&gt;<i> MuSig2 as a black box as indicated in the &quot;Adaptor Signatures&quot; section [1].
</I>
Hmm, you had me panicking that I'd been describing how to combine the
two despite having decided it wasn't necessary to combine them... :)

(I figured doing musig for k ptlcs for every update would get old fast --
if you maxed the channel out with ~400 inflight ptlcs you'd be exchanging
~800 nonces for every update. OTOH, I guess that's the only thing you'd
be saving, and the cost is ~176 bytes of extra witness data per ptlc...
Hmm...)

Cheers,
aj
