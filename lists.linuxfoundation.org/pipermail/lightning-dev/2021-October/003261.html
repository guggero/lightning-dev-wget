</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current BOLT specification only requires Alice's `dust_limit_satoshis`
</I>&gt;<i> (applied on Alice's commitment) to be under Alice's
</I>&gt;<i> `channel_reserve_satoshis` (applied on Bob). As those 2 parameters are
</I>&gt;<i> selectable by Alice, she can inflate the dust limit until reaching the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation-defined max value (e.g LND: 20% of chan capacity, LDK: 100%
</I>&gt;<i> of chan capacity).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any in-flight incoming HTLC under Alice's dust limit will be converted as
</I>&gt;<i> miner fees on Alice's commitment. This HTLC is deducted from Bob's balance
</I>&gt;<i> and as such they're still owned by Bob, until resolution (i.e a RAA
</I>&gt;<i> removing the HTLC from Alice's commitment). This limitation only applies
</I>&gt;<i> per-HTLC. No implementation enforces a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs
</I>&gt;<i> burned as fees. Therefore, Alice is free to inflict a substantial loss to
</I>&gt;<i> Bob funds by publishing her commitment on-chain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In-flight outgoing HTLC are also committed as fees on Bob's commitment if
</I>&gt;<i> they're under Bob's threshold. Alice can also exploit from this angle by
</I>&gt;<i> circular routing HTLCs until reaching Bob's
</I>&gt;<i> `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat`. Alice withholds HTLCs resolution until Bob
</I>&gt;<i> goes on-chain to timeout an offered HTLC or claim an accepted HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dust HTLC processing can be also exploited at `update_fee` reception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the BOLT3's fees computation encompasses the negotiated feerate from
</I>&gt;<i> `update_fee` for the 2nd-stage HTLC fees to decide if the HTLC must be
</I>&gt;<i> trimmed, the amount of balance at risk is a function of current mempool
</I>&gt;<i> feerates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The maximum of funds at risk on a counterparty commitment is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty's `max_accepted_htlcs` * (`htlc_success_tx_kw` * opener's
</I>&gt;<i> `feerate_per_kw` + counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis`) + holder's
</I>&gt;<i> `max_accepted_htlcs` * (`htlc_timeout_tx_kw` * opener's `feerate_per_kw` +
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis`)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the opener is also the attacker, the negotiated feerate can be
</I>&gt;<i> manipulated beyond the &quot;honest&quot; mempool feerates only upper bounded
</I>&gt;<i> implementation-defined value (before fixes, LDK: 2 * high-feerate of our
</I>&gt;<i> fee-estimator). If the opener is the victim, the negotiated feerate is
</I>&gt;<i> still a safety concern in case of spontaneous mempool spikes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, `anchors_zero_htlc_fee` channels are not affected by the feerate
</I>&gt;<i> inflation as the trimmed-to-dust fee computation mechanism for 2nd-stage
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC is removed. They're still at risk of the sum of the HTLCs under the
</I>&gt;<i> dust limit being maliciously burned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Solution
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A first mitigation is to verify the counterparty's announced
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_limit_satoshis` at channel opening (`open_channel`/`accept_channel`)
</I>&gt;<i> reception and reject if it's estimated too large (see #894)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For LDK, we choose the value of 660 satoshis as it's beyond the highest
</I>&gt;<i> dust threshold enforced by Bitcoin Core (p2pkh: 546) with a margin of
</I>&gt;<i> safety. Propagation of Lightning time-sensitive transactions shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> affected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A second mitigation is to define a new configurable limit
</I>&gt;<i> `max_dust_htlc_exposure` and apply this one at incoming and outgoing of
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For LDK, we choose the value of 5 000 000 milli-satoshis as we gauged this
</I>&gt;<i> value as a substantial loss for our class of users. Setting this too low
</I>&gt;<i> may prevent the sending or receipt of low-value HTLCs on high-traffic
</I>&gt;<i> nodes. A node operator should fine-tune this value in function of what
</I>&gt;<i> qualifies as an acceptable loss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would like to ensure that the node isn't suddenly exposed to
</I>&gt;<i> significantly more trimmed balance if the feerate increases when we have
</I>&gt;<i> several HTLCs pending which are near the dust limit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To achieve this goal, we introduce a new `dust_buffer_feerate` defined as
</I>&gt;<i> the maximum of either 2530 sats per kWU or 125% of the current
</I>&gt;<i> `feerate_per_kw` (implementation-defined values).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, upon an incoming HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount_msat` is inferior to
</I>&gt;<i> the counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis` plus the HTLC-timeout fee at the
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_buffer_feerate`. If the `amount_msat` plus the
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_balance_on_counterparty_tx` is superior to `max_dust_htlc_exposure`,
</I>&gt;<i> the HTLC should be failed once it's committed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Upon an outgoing HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount_msat` is inferior to the
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty's `dust_limit_satoshis`  plus the HTLC-success fee at the
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_buffer_feerate`. If the `amount_msat` plus the
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_balance_on_counterparty_tx` is superior to `max_dust_htlc_exposure`,
</I>&gt;<i> the HTLC should not be sent and fail without forwarding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The check symmetry must also be applied on holder commitment transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> See PR #919 for more details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A last mitigation is ensuring that at `update_fee` reception, the pending
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_balance` at the new proposed feerate isn't superior to
</I>&gt;<i> `max_dust_htlc_exposure_msat`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Background
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The dust limit is a base layer policy stopping the relay of a transaction
</I>&gt;<i> if one of its outputs is under a given threshold. The goal of this policy
</I>&gt;<i> is to prevent the pollution of the UTXO set with low-value outputs and as
</I>&gt;<i> such increase the amount of work done by full-nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning commitment transactions should be able to propagate at any point
</I>&gt;<i> during the channel lifetime to unilaterally enforce on-chain a balance. A
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning commitment transaction with one of its outputs below the dust
</I>&gt;<i> limit would fail to relay and thus jeopardizes funds safety.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To prevent this, BOLT2 requires counterparties to announce a
</I>&gt;<i> `dust_limit_satoshis` during channel opening (at
</I>&gt;<i> `open_channel`/`accept_channel` exchange). This `dust_limit_satoshis` must
</I>&gt;<i> be under the same party's `channel_reserve_satoshis`. This value is static
</I>&gt;<i> for the channel lifetime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During commitment signatures exchange, each counterparty's limit is
</I>&gt;<i> applied on each counterparty's commitment (e.g A's `dust_limit_satoshis` is
</I>&gt;<i> applied on A's commitment, though both A and B have to generate and sign
</I>&gt;<i> the transaction). An output below this limit is trimmed to fees and won't
</I>&gt;<i> materialize on the commitment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The specification didn't require that the `open_channel`/`accept_channel`
</I>&gt;<i> receiver verify that the announced `dust_limit_satoshis` isn't too large.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The specification didn't require that the sum of the dust HTLC committed
</I>&gt;<i> as fees was verified against an upper bound.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Discovery
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vulnerabilities around our dust HTLC processing have been known for years
</I>&gt;<i> by some LN developers/researchers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During Q1 2019, private discussions on the Rust-Lightning-side (LDK before
</I>&gt;<i> marketing rebranding) about potential safety risks around dust HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In November 2019, Rusty Russell (c-lightning) opened an issue against the
</I>&gt;<i> specification mentioning the lack of check of counterparty's dust limit
</I>&gt;<i> (#696).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In May 2020, I published a high-level attack scenario &quot;Miners Dust
</I>&gt;<i> Inflation attacks on Lightning Network&quot;, leveraging this lack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In February 2021, I did a test of the first vulnerability against LND
</I>&gt;<i> software and successfully burnt the majority of the targeted node balance
</I>&gt;<i> in fees. As it sounds to me like a check missing in the specification, I
</I>&gt;<i> notified CL/LND/Eclair/LDK maintainers. Mitigations started to be developed
</I>&gt;<i> on the LDK-side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In July 2021, in the context of `option_dusty_htlcs_uncounted`
</I>&gt;<i> discussions, Eugene Spiegel (LND) reported on how to exploit the
</I>&gt;<i> trimmed-to-dust mechanism at `update_fee` reception. Discussions followed
</I>&gt;<i> on the best way to mitigate this new vector.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During August 2021, mitigations were developed and released on the
</I>&gt;<i> LDK-side. vulnerabilities were disclosed to other Lightning projects (Muun
</I>&gt;<i> wallet, Electrum). From the LDK-side, a public disclosure date was proposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still during August 2021, the Bitcoin Core dust limit was actively
</I>&gt;<i> discussed on the mailing list. Changes of this dust limit would have
</I>&gt;<i> affected the ongoing development of the mitigations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While this report highlights the lack of well-defined communication
</I>&gt;<i> process across Lightning teams,  developers from 3 different
</I>&gt;<i> implementations have actively participated in the vulnerabilities
</I>&gt;<i> diagnostic and mitigations development of those long-standing specification
</I>&gt;<i> issues affecting the whole Lightning ecosystem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All mistakes and opinions are my own and please verify any information
</I>&gt;<i> reported.
