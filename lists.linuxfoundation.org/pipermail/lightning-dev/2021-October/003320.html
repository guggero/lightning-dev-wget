<PRE>Good morning ZmnSCPxj,

&gt;<i> I heard before that the RGB colored coin project had plans to be compatible with Lightning so that channels could be denominated in an issued asset.
</I>
RGB will address lot of things but I was wondering if such things should exist in LN implementations by default. Example: If we had two ways to issue assets LA1 and LA2, the user can issue asset using a command: lightning-cli -named issueassets -type=LA1 -number=1000

&gt;<i> Blockstream I believe has plans to include support for Liquid-issued assets in C-Lightning somehow; C-Lightning already supports running on top of Liquid instead of directly on the Bitcoin blockchain layer (but still uses Bitcoin for the channel asset type)
</I>
This is interesting.

Still trying to understand this problem and possible solutions. Interesting email though (TIL), thanks for sharing the link. Found related things explained Suredbits blog as well.

&gt;<i> Good morning Prayank,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wanted to know few things related to asset issuance on lightning:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.Is it possible to issue assets on LN right now? If yes, what's the process and is it as easy as few commands in liquid:&#160;<A HREF="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005127583-How-do-I-issue-an-asset-on-Liquid-">https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005127583-How-do-I-issue-an-asset-on-Liquid-</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.If no, is anyone working or planning to work on it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.I had read few things about Omni BOLT which could solve this problem but not sure about status of project and development:&#160;<A HREF="https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec">https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Few use cases for tokens on lightning:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.DEX
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.Stablecoins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.Liquidity: If projects could incentivize users with native tokens that are associated with the project on every LN channel opened it would improve liquidity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I heard before that the RGB colored coin project had plans to be compatible with Lightning so that channels could be denominated in an issued asset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most plans for colored coins on Lightning generally assume that each channel has just a single asset, as that seems to be simpler, at least as a start.
</I>&gt;<i> However, this complicates the use of such channels for forwarding, as we would like to restrict channel gossip to channels that *any* node can easily prove actually exist as a UTXO onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, colored coins would need to somehow be provable as existing to *any* node (or at least those that support colored coins somehow) on the LN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blockstream I believe has plans to include support for Liquid-issued assets in C-Lightning somehow; C-Lightning already supports running on top of Liquid instead of directly on the Bitcoin blockchain layer (but still uses Bitcoin for the channel asset type).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, the assumption is that there would be a Lightning Network where channels have different asset types, and you can forward via any channel, suffering some kind of asset conversion fee if you have a hop where the incoming asset is different from the outgoing asset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, do note that some years ago I pointed out that swaps between two *different* assets are a form of very lousy American Call Option: <A HREF="../2018-December/001752.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-December/001752.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Due to this, issued assets may not be usable on Lightning after all, even if someone makes the work to make non-Bitcoin assets on Lightning channels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am unaware of any actual decent solutions to the American Call Option problem, but it has been a few years since then and someone might have come up with a solution by now (we hope, maybe).
</I>&gt;<i> I believe CJP had a trust-requiring solution: <A HREF="../2018-May/001292.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-May/001292.html</A> and <A HREF="https://bitonic.nl/public/slowdown_prevention.pdf">https://bitonic.nl/public/slowdown_prevention.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a paper which requires Ethereum (I have not read it because it required Ethereum): <A HREF="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/896.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/896.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may be possible to use Barrier Escrows: <A HREF="https://suredbits.com/payment-points-implementing-barrier-escrows/">https://suredbits.com/payment-points-implementing-barrier-escrows/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Barrier Escrows are still trusted (and I think they can serve as the RM role in the CJP paper?) to operate correctly, but the exact use of their service is blinded to them.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, any single participant of a multi-participant protocol can probably unblind the Barrier Escrow, so still not a perfectly trustless solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
</I>&gt;<i>
