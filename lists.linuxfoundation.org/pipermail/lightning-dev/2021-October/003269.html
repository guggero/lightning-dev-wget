<PRE>mostly thinking out loud

suppose there is a &quot;lightweight&quot; node:

1. ignores utxo's below the dust limit
2. doesn't validate dust tx
3. still validates POW, other tx, etc.

these nodes could possibly get forked - accepting a series of valid,
mined blocks where there is an invalid but ignored dust tx, however
this attack seems every bit as expensive as a 51% attack

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1.  it's not our business what outputs people want to create
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every additional output added to the UTXO set increases the amount of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work full nodes need to do to validate new transactions. For miners
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for whom fast validation of new blocks can significantly affect their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; revenue, larger UTXO sets increase their costs and so contributes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; towards centralization of mining.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Allowing 0-value or 1-sat outputs minimizes the cost for polluting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UTXO set during periods of low feerates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If your stuff is going to slow down my node and possibly reduce my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; censorship resistance, how is that not my business?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed - UTXO set size is an externality that unfortunately Bitcoin's consensus rules fail to account
</I>&gt;<i> for. Having a relay policy that avoids at the very least economically irrational behavior makes
</I>&gt;<i> perfect sense to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's also not obvious how consensus rules could deal with this, as you don't want consensus rules
</I>&gt;<i> with hardcoded prices/feerates. There are possibilities with designs like transactions getting
</I>&gt;<i> a size/weight bonus/penalty, but that's both very hardforky, and hard to get right without
</I>&gt;<i> introducing bad incentives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2.  dust outputs can be used in various authentication/delegation smart
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     contracts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3.  dust sized htlcs in lightning (

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     force channels to operate in a semi-trusted mode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 4.  thinly divisible colored coin protocols might make use of sats as value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     markers for transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My personal, and possibly controversial, opinion is that colored coin protocols have no business being on the Bitcoin chain, possibly
</I>&gt;<i> beyond committing to an occasional batched state update or so. Both because there is little benefit for tokens with a trusted
</I>&gt;<i> issuer already, and because it competes with using Bitcoin for BTC - the token that pays for its security (at least as long as
</I>&gt;<i> the subsidy doesn't run out).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, personal opinions are no reason to dictate what people should or can use the chain for, but I do think it's reason to
</I>&gt;<i> voice hesitancy to worsening the system's scalability properties only to benefit what I consider misguided use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 5.  should we ever do confidential transactions we can't prevent it without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     compromising privacy / allowed transfers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that you can do that with range
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proofs. The range proof for &gt;dust doesn't need to become part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; block chain, it can be relay only.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, range proofs have a non-hidden range; the lower bound can be nonzero, which could be required as part of a relay policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
