<PRE>Good morning Owen,

Good observation!

I propose substantially the same thing here: <A HREF="../2021-September/003256.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-September/003256.html</A>

In that proposal, I wrote:

&gt;<i> Another thought is: Does the forwarding node have an incentive to lie?
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose the next hop is alive but the forwarding node has insufficient capacity towards the next hop.
</I>&gt;<i> Then the forwarding node can lie and claim it can still resolve the HTLC, in the hope that a few milliseconds later, when the actual HTLC arrives, the capacity towards the next hop has changed.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, even if the capacity now is insufficient, the forwarding node has an incentive to lie and claim sufficient capacity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Against the above, we can mitigate this by accepting &quot;no&quot; from *any* node along the path, but only accepting &quot;yes&quot; from the actual payee.
</I>
We already have a mechanism to send an onion and get back an &quot;error&quot; reply; the reply can be identified by the sender as arising from any node along the path, or at the destination.
Basically, we simply reuse this mechanism:

* Do not need an HTLC with this onion.
* Only accept a &quot;everything is OK&quot; result from the destination.
* Accept a &quot;sorry cannot forward&quot; from *any* node along the path.

Thus, a malicious node cannot succeed the probe --- the probe has to reach the destination.

Now the malicious forwarding node could be colluding with the destination, but presumably the destination wants to *actually* get paid, so we expect that, economically, it has no incentive to cooperate with the malicious node to *fail* the actual payment later just to extract a tiny failure fee.
