<PRE>Good morning list,

I've been mulling over some limitations of our feature bits mechanism and
I'm interested in your ideas and comments.

Our feature bits mechanism works well for symmetric features (where both
peers play the same role) but not so well for asymmetric features (where
there is a client and a service provider). Here is a hypothetical example to
illustrate that. Any similarity to existing wallet features is entirely
coincidental.

Alice has a mobile lightning wallet that can be woken up via push
notifications.
Bob runs a lightning node that can send push notifications to mobile
wallets to
wake them up on important events (e.g. incoming htlcs).

We can't use a single feature bit to model that, because what Alice supports
is actually &quot;I can be woken up via push notifications&quot;, but she can't send
push
notifications to other nodes (and similarly, Bob only supports waking up
other
nodes, not receiving push notifications).

So we must use two feature bits: `wake_me_up_plz` and `i_say_wake_up`.
Alice activates `wake_me_up_plz`, Bob activates `i_say_wake_up` and it's
now clear what part of the protocol each node can handle.

But how does Alice require her peers to support `i_say_wake_up`?
She can't turn on the feature with the mandatory bit because then her peers
would be confused and think she can wake up other devices.

I see two potential solutions:

   1. Re-purpose the meaning of `optional` and `mandatory` bits for
   asymmetric feature: the odd bit would mean &quot;I support this feature&quot;
   and the even bit would mean &quot;I require my peer to support this feature&quot;
   2. Add a requirement to send a warning and disconnect when a client
   connects to a provider that hasn't activated the provider-side feature

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Bastien

Note: I opened an issue for that for those who prefer github:
