Well, the idea (in my head at least) is it should be &quot;safe&quot; to restore
an eltoo channel from a backup even if it's out of date, so the question
is what &quot;safe&quot; can actually mean. LN-penalty definitely isn't safe in
that scenario.

</I>
I don't think you can reliably hide that you forgot some state? If you
_did_ forget your state, you'll have forgotten their latest bundle too,
and it seems like there's at least a 50/50 chance you'd have to send
them their bundle before they sent you yours?

Sharing with other peers has costs too -- if you can't commit to an
updated state with peer A until you've sent the updated data to peers
B and C as backup, then you've got a lot more latency on each channel,
for example. And if you commit first, then you've got the problem of
what happens if you crash before the update has made it to either B or C?

But I guess what I'm saying is sure -- those are great ideas, but they
only reduce the chance that you'll not have the latest state, they don't
eliminate it.

But it seems like it can probably be reduced enough that it's fine that
you're risking the balances in live HTLCs (or perhaps HTLCs that have
been initiated since your last state backup), as long as you're at least
able to claim your channel balance from whatever more recent state your
peers may have.

Cheers,
aj
