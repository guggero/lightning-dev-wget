<PRE>I'm sorry for the bad copy/paste in the last email. Resending:

Hi,

I propose a new invoice pattern that contains a Bitcoin address for onchain
transfer.

Motivation: My dream is to have a portfolio that works in a totally
abstract and transparent way onchain and/or LN depending on the situation.
Phoenix wallet almost achieves this, but there is still a certain
LN/onchain distinction that confuses users a bit.

I use Phoenix daily. Today, for some reason, I couldn't pay a friend.
Payment failed in several attempts. It was not clear why. The fact is that
I managed to transfer to Breeze and then from there I was finally able to
transfer to the final destination. For some reason it had no liquidity on
the specific route. These exception cases greatly confuse the most
non-expert users. If, on the invoice my friend sent me, I had embedded a
Bitcoin address, the wallet could simply ask: &quot;Couldn't send via LN, do you
want to send onchain at XPTO rate?&quot;

That way, in case of payment failure, there is an immediate onchain backup
alternative, useful especially when rates are low, like now.

The format could be something like:

&lt;prefix&gt;:&lt;version&gt;:&lt;bitcoin address&gt;:&lt;invoice&gt;

Example:

ln:v1:bc1qucfe06nunhrczh9nrfdxyvma84thy3eugs0825:lnbc20m1pvjluezpp5qqqsyqcyq5rqwzqfqqqsyqcyq5rqwzqfqqqsyqcyq5rqwzqfqypqhp58yjmdan79s6qqdhdzgynm4zwqd5d7xmw5fk98klysy043l2ahrqsfpp3qjmp7lwpagxun9pygexvgpjdc4jdj85fr9yq20q82gphp2nflc7jtzrcazrra7wwgzxqc8u7754cdlpfrmccae92qgzqvzq2ps8pqqqqqqpqqqqq9qqqvpeuqafqxu92d8lr6fvg0r5gv0heeeqgcrqlnm6jhphu9y00rrhy4grqszsvpcgpy9qqqqqqgqqqqq7qqzqj9n4evl6mr5aj9f58zp6fyjzup6ywn3x6sk8akg5v4tgn2q8g4fhx05wf6juaxu9760yp46454gpg5mtzgerlzezqcqvjnhjh8z3g2qqdhhwkj
