<PRE>Hi,

I am sorry to hear you had trouble with payment pathfinding. However if I
understand your suggestion correctly I think the proposed functionality
already exists in a very similar way in today's invoices with a mechanism
called fallback address. The main difference seems to be that the fallback
adress is not a human readable part of the invoice string but encoded with
the other data in the bech32 part of the invoice.

Check bolt 11 [1] on github for more detail but I copied the relevant
snippets from there to this mail.


   - f (9): data_length variable, depending on version. Fallback on-chain
   address: for Bitcoin, this starts with a 5-bit version and contains a
   witness program or P2PKH or P2SH address.

The f field allows on-chain fallback; however, this may not make sense for
tiny or time-sensitive payments. It's possible that new address forms will
appear; thus, multiple f fields (in an implied preferred order) help with
transition, and f fields with versions 19-31 will be ignored by readers.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I propose a new LN invoice pattern that contains a Bitcoin address for
</I>&gt;<i> onchain transfer as backup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Motivation: My dream is to have an app wallet that works in a totally
</I>&gt;<i> abstract and transparent way onchain and/or LN depending on the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> Phoenix wallet almost achieves this, but there is still a certain
</I>&gt;<i> LN/onchain distinction that confuses users a bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use Phoenix daily. Today, for some reason, I couldn't pay a friend.
</I>&gt;<i> Payment failed in several attempts. It was not clear why. The fact is that
</I>&gt;<i> I managed to transfer to Breeze and then from there I was finally able to
</I>&gt;<i> transfer to the final destination. For some reason it had no liquidity on
</I>&gt;<i> the specific route. These exception cases greatly confuse the most
</I>&gt;<i> non-expert users. If, on the invoice my friend sent to me, I had embedded a
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin address, the wallet could simply ask: &quot;Couldn't send via LN, do you
</I>&gt;<i> want to send it on-chain at XPTO fee rate? It can take a while.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That way, in case of payment failure, there is an immediate onchain backup
</I>&gt;<i> alternative, useful especially when rates are low, like now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The format could be something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;prefix&gt;:&lt;version&gt;:&lt;bitcoin address&gt;:&lt;invoice&gt;
