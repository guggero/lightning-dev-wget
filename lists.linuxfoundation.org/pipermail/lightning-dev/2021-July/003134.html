<PRE>What would happen in 2) if the node has data but the peer returned an
incorrect state?

&gt;<i> Not quite sure if this issue is unique to eltoo tbh. While in LN-penalty

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have a couple of options here, that don't touch the blockchain, and
</I>&gt;<i> are therefore rather lightweight:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1) Do nothing and keep the incentive to keep up to date backups. It
</I>&gt;<i>  still is a reduction in risk w.r.t. LN-penalty, since this is just an
</I>&gt;<i>  append only log of secrets, and old secrets don't harm you like
</I>&gt;<i>  attempting to close with an old commitment would.
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Use the peer-storage idea, where we deposit an encrypted bundle with
</I>&gt;<i>  our peers, and which we expect the peers to return. by hiding the fact
</I>&gt;<i>  that we forgot some state, until the data has been exchanged we can
</I>&gt;<i>  ensure that peers always return the latest snapshot of whatever we gave
</I>&gt;<i>  them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latter is the encrypted-blob idea that Rusty has been proposing for
</I>&gt;<i> a while now.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello world,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose you have some payments going from Alice to Bob to Carol with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eltoo channels. Bob's lightning node crashes, and he recovers from an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; old backup, and Alice and Carol end up dropping newer channel states
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; onto the blockchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose the timeout for the payments is a few hours away, while the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channels have specified a week long CSV delay to rectify any problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on-chain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then I think that that means that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  1) Carol will reveal the point preimages on-chain via adaptor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     signatures, but Bob won't be able to decode those adaptor signatures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     because those signatures will need to change for each state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  2) Even if Bob knows the point preimages, he won't be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     claim the PTLC payments on-chain, for the same reason: he needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     newer adaptor signatures that he'll have lost with the state update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  3) For any payments that timeout, Carol doesn't have any particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     incentive to make it easy for Bob to claim the refund, and Bob won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     have the adaptor signatures for the latest state to do so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  4) But Alice will be able to claim refunds easily. This is working how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     it's meant to, at least!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think you could fix (3) by giving Carol (who does have all the adaptor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signatures for the latest state) the ability to steal funds that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meant to have been refunded, provided she gives Bob the option of
</I>&gt;<i> claiming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them first.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However fixing (1) and (2) aren't really going against Alice or Carol's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interests, so maybe you can just ask: Carol loses nothing by allowing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bob to claim funds from Alice; and Alice has already indicated that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knowing P is worth more to her than the PTLC's funds -- otherwise she
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wouldn't have forwarded the PTLC to Bob in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Likewise, everyone's probably incentivised to negotiate cooperative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closes instead of going on-chain -- better privacy, less fees, and less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delay before the funds can be used elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FWIW, I think a similar flaw exists even in the original eltoo spec --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alice could simply decline to publish the settlement transaction until
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the timeout has been reached, preventing Bob from revealing the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preimage before Alice can claim the refund.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I think that adds up to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  a) Nodes should share state on reconnection; if you find a node that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     doesn't do this, close the channel and put the node on your enemies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     list. If you disagree on what the current state is, share your most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     recent state, and if the other guy's state is more recent, and all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the signatures verify, update your state to match theirs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  b) Always negotiate a mutual/cooperative close if possible, to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     actually using the eltoo protocol on-chain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  c) If you want to allow continuing the channel after restoring an old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     state from backup, set the channel state index based on the real
</I>&gt;<i> time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     eg (real_time-start_time)*(max_updates_per_second). That way your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     first update after a restore from backup will ensure that any old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     states that your channel partner may not have told you about are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     invalidated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  d) Accept that if you lose connectivity to a channel partner, you will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     have to pay any PTLCs that were going to them, and won't be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     to claim the PTLCs that were funding them. Perhaps limit the total
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     value of inbound PTLCs for forwarding that you're willing to accept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     at any one itme?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, layered commitments seem like they make channel factories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated too. Nobody came up with a way to avoid layered commitments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while I wasn't watching did they?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aj
