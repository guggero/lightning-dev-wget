<PRE>There was some additional discussion on L2 onchain support at the
recent online Sydney Socratic Seminar. It wasn't recorded but a
transcript is below.

Transcript: <A HREF="https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2021-07-06-socratic-seminar/">https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2021-07-06-socratic-seminar/</A>

The discussion focused partly on the rules [1] of BIP 125 RBF and the
rationale for these rules (which isn't clear from the BIP). Proposed
ideas such as SIGHASH_IOMAP, fee sponsorship and transaction mutation
were also discussed that weren't covered during the IRC workshops.

</I>&gt;<i> The focus for this second workshop was fee bumping and package relay.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Package relay background
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Package relay is potentially useful for L2 protocols to address the
</I>&gt;<i> inherent unpredictability of future fees. CPFP (child-pays-for-parent)
</I>&gt;<i> seeks to ensure say a justice transaction, in Lightning&#8217;s case, with a
</I>&gt;<i> lower fee, gets confirmed in a more timely manner because miners are
</I>&gt;<i> incentivized to include the child transaction in a block. To do so
</I>&gt;<i> they must include the parent transaction in that block or a preceding
</I>&gt;<i> block. By &#8220;packaging&#8221; the parent and the child the initiator of the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction(s) can ensure the miner&#8217;s mempool doesn&#8217;t initially reject
</I>&gt;<i> the parent transaction for having a too low fee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There has been prior work done in previous years on package relay,
</I>&gt;<i> mainly by Suhas Daftuar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Draft BIP: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/sdaftuar/8756699bfcad4d3806ba9f3396d4e66a">https://gist.github.com/sdaftuar/8756699bfcad4d3806ba9f3396d4e66a</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Package relay design questions: <A HREF="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14895">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14895</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently Gloria Zhao has been advancing package relay in Bitcoin Core:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/glozow/7064717e727a3eb27fad4f8504513add">https://gist.github.com/glozow/7064717e727a3eb27fad4f8504513add</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Package relay implementation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Attendees seemed in agreement that enabling 2 transaction packages
</I>&gt;<i> would be sufficient (at least for now) for Lightning and DLCs. A L2
</I>&gt;<i> protocol should always be able to design a two step process where the
</I>&gt;<i> first transaction has an effective zero fee rate and the second
</I>&gt;<i> transaction sets the fee. Restricting the size of the package to 2 may
</I>&gt;<i> have the cost of slightly longer confirmation times and/or slightly
</I>&gt;<i> higher fees (t-bast) but it compares well to the increased
</I>&gt;<i> implementation complexity of larger package sizes. Two generation:
</I>&gt;<i> multi parent, single child shouldn&#8217;t introduce material implementation
</I>&gt;<i> complexity over two generation: single parent, single child (glozow).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Package RBF (replace-by-fee) is possible where there are two competing
</I>&gt;<i> packages with competing Lightning commitment transactions in them and
</I>&gt;<i> the second package is given a higher fee to attempt to get it
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed before the first package. However, supporting RBF within a
</I>&gt;<i> package (ie replacing a transaction in a package with a higher fee
</I>&gt;<i> transaction) increases implementation complexity and makes it harder
</I>&gt;<i> to reason about (glozow).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rgrant raised the possibility of using two packages {A,B} and {B,C} if
</I>&gt;<i> three transaction packages e.g. {A,B,C} weren&#8217;t supported but it was
</I>&gt;<i> suggested it is perhaps better to just broadcast a high fee CPFP
</I>&gt;<i> transaction for the {A,B} package rather than creating two packages.
</I>&gt;<i> If the first package has been evicted from the mempool the {B,C}
</I>&gt;<i> package wouldn&#8217;t propagate because it would be an orphan package
</I>&gt;<i> (t-bast).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> glozow suggested that only hints (wtxids of transactions you think
</I>&gt;<i> should be package validated) could be communicated rather than
</I>&gt;<i> relaying the transaction themselves but there were concerns from
</I>&gt;<i> others on whether these hints would successfully propagate across the
</I>&gt;<i> network. Instead fee rate hints could be sent to inform a peer&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> decision on whether it makes sense to fetch the rest of the package
</I>&gt;<i> (t-bast).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> darosior suggested the idea of a package based CBlockPolicyEstimator
</I>&gt;<i> in Bitcoin Core if CPFP is going to be increasingly used on the
</I>&gt;<i> network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Witness replacement and Taproot
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tapscripts can be unlimited in size so with current Taproot rules you
</I>&gt;<i> could in theory go from a 100,000 vbyte witness to an empty witness.
</I>&gt;<i> L2 protocols may have a UTXO shared by two parties where Alice&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> witness for her branch is say 1,000 vbytes and Bob&#8217;s witness is only
</I>&gt;<i> say 250 vbytes. Replacing Alice&#8217;s larger witness with Bob&#8217;s smaller
</I>&gt;<i> witness could reduce transaction fees. For Lightning the best case is
</I>&gt;<i> a Taproot key path spend (16 vbyte witness) and the worst case is
</I>&gt;<i> going to be a 150 vbyte witness. Miniscript can tell you your worst
</I>&gt;<i> case transaction size and this can be used to assess the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> pinning risk of a bloated witness (all harding).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A future soft fork could give meaning to the annex in Taproot
</I>&gt;<i> (darosior) which could be used for inflating the fee rate of a
</I>&gt;<i> witness. Then you could have a same-txid-different-wtxid coming after
</I>&gt;<i> with a lower fee rate but higher vbytes size to override package
</I>&gt;<i> limits (ariard). But fee rate is purely a policy concept and the annex
</I>&gt;<i> operates at the consensus level. In addition the annex can only
</I>&gt;<i> increase the weight of a transaction, it cannot decrease it (harding).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wrap up and initial goals
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With regards to the goals of the workshops that were initially
</I>&gt;<i> announced here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../2021-April/003002.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-April/003002.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) 2 transactions packages sounds enough to support currently deployed
</I>&gt;<i> L2 protocols
</I>&gt;<i> 2) There are ongoing discussions in the ecosystem regarding
</I>&gt;<i> deprecation of opt in RBF and implementation of full RBF:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-June/019074.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-June/019074.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Generally status quo and ad hoc security incident response policy
</I>&gt;<i> in the case of cross-layer security issues
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Generally status quo on L2 security philosophy design. L2 protocol
</I>&gt;<i> designers should seek to minimize assumptions on the base layer.
