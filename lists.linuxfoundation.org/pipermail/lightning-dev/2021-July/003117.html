<PRE>Hi,

I propose a new LN invoice pattern that contains a Bitcoin address for
onchain transfer as backup.

Motivation: My dream is to have an app wallet that works in a totally
abstract and transparent way onchain and/or LN depending on the situation.
Phoenix wallet almost achieves this, but there is still a certain
LN/onchain distinction that confuses users a bit.

I use Phoenix daily. Today, for some reason, I couldn't pay a friend.
Payment failed in several attempts. It was not clear why. The fact is that
I managed to transfer to Breeze and then from there I was finally able to
transfer to the final destination. For some reason it had no liquidity on
the specific route. These exception cases greatly confuse the most
non-expert users. If, on the invoice my friend sent to me, I had embedded a
Bitcoin address, the wallet could simply ask: &quot;Couldn't send via LN, do you
want to send it on-chain at XPTO fee rate? It can take a while.&quot;

That way, in case of payment failure, there is an immediate onchain backup
alternative, useful especially when rates are low, like now.

The format could be something like:

&lt;prefix&gt;:&lt;version&gt;:&lt;bitcoin address&gt;:&lt;invoice&gt;

Example:
