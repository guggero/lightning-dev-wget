<PRE>As a part of my ongoing review of BIP-118 I put together the following
chart.

Source:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KeWJ_cly9zoRX5_h70RTniRT2m8_iaVceK_aF6obWeM">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KeWJ_cly9zoRX5_h70RTniRT2m8_iaVceK_aF6obWeM</A>

Not tightly checked to be free of errors, but I figured such a chart would
be helpful for folks evaluating BIP-118.

Perhaps the BIPs (generally, incl 34x) could be updated to present the
information in such a chart -- at least for me it's much clearer than
following a bunch of conditional logic (maybe if there's ever desire for
some consensus refactoring this could be a table in the code replacing the
cond logic).

A few highlighted nuances:

- input index is never signed (i previously thought one mode signed it).
Key reuse under APOAS|Default and APOAS|All is a bit extra unsafe given
susceptibility to the &quot;half-spend&quot; problem. This limits usability of APO
for covenants a-la CTV because you can't stop someone from adding inputs to
your contract nor can you prevent half-spend problems when reusing
addresses.
- APO signs the Amounts, APOAS never does.
- APO signs both the SPK and the Tapleaf hash, meaning that APO binds
itself to the entire script rather than just it's fragment. There's no
setting which is &quot;just this fragment&quot;
- APO's signature binds it to a specific script fragment *within* a taproot
key, but not a specific script path
- the flag &quot;default&quot; is not really a flag at all -- when default is used
(as a or'd byte) there are different results than when default is inferred
(by absence of a byte) (this is maybe a bitcoin core specific quirk).
- There are 16 different possible modes total, so all combinations of flags
mean *something* (advisable or not as with ACP | None)
- | Default and | All overlap, so there's an opportunity to either reserve
or assign 4 additional sighash modes if desired. These could cover some of
the gaps above, or be saved for future purposes rather than be wasted now.
Another point of interest is -- not to rock the boat -- but because BIP-118
is defining a new key type we could do away with the notion that sighash
flags are &quot;flags&quot; and convert to an enum (e.g., numbered 0-256 for whatever
combination of fields each would incur) and give each signature type a
sensible name, rather than thinking of things as a combo of flags (e.g.,
APOAS is not some intersection of what APO and ACP do independently).

Hopefully this helps!

Cheers,

Jeremy
