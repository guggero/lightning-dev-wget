I don't think that's correct -- you should be using the CLTV path for
updating the state, rather than the CSV path; so CSV shouldn't matter.

I think this is effectively reinventing/special casing channel
factories? That is you start an eltoo channel factory amongst group
{A,B,C,...}, then if {A,B} want an eltoo channel, that's a single update
to the factory; that channel can get updated independently until A and
B get bored and want to close their channel, which is then a single
additional update to the factory. In this case, the factory just doesn't
include the additional members {C,...}.

</I>
This feels cleverer/novel to me -- but as you point out it's actually
more costly than the trampoline/factory approach so perhaps it's not
that great.

I think what you'd do is change from a single tapscript of &quot;OP_1
CHECKSIG &lt;500e6+i&gt; CLTV&quot; to a tree of tapscripts:

  &quot;&lt;P_i&gt; CHECKSIG &lt;500e6+j+1&gt; CLTV&quot;

so if your state is (i*2**30 + j) you're spending using &lt;P_i&gt; with a
locktime of 500e6+j, and you're allowing later spends with the above script
filled in with (i,j) or (i',0) for i&lt;i'&lt;N.

That means you're paying extra to specify a merkle path of lg(N)*32 and
the key P_i (33 bytes).

&gt;<i> You can take a random path through which leaf you are using which, if you're
</I>&gt;<i> careful about how you construct your scripts (e.g., keeping the trees the same
</I>&gt;<i> size) you can be more private w.r.t. how many state updates you performed
</I>&gt;<i> throughout the protocol (i.e., you can see the low order bits in the CLTV
</I>&gt;<i> clause, but the high order bits of A, B, C's relationship is not revealed if
</I>&gt;<i> you traverse them in a deterministically permuted order).
</I>
Tapscript trees are shuffled randomly based on the hashes of their
scripts, so I think that's a non-issue. You could keep the trees the
same size by adding scripts &quot;&lt;P_i&gt; CHECKSIG &lt;500e6+j+1&gt; RETURN&quot;.

&gt;<i> The space downside of this approach v.s. the approach presented in the prior
</I>&gt;<i> email is that the prior approach achieves 64 bits with 2 txns one of which
</I>&gt;<i> should be like 150 bytes, a similar amount of data for the script leaves may
</I>&gt;<i> only gets you 5 bits of added sequence space.&#160;
</I>
You'd get 2**34 states (4 added bits of added sequence space) for
about 161 extra bytes (4 merkle branches at 32B each and revealing the
pubkey for 33B), compared to about 2**60 states (2**30 states for the
second tx, with a different second tx for each of the 2**30 states of
the first tx). Haven't done the math to check the 150 byte estimate,
but it seems the right ballpark.

Cheers,
aj
