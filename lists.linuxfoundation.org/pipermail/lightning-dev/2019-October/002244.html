<PRE>Cool: non-source rendez-vous routing. Getting closer to 2013 Amiko Pay,
with the added experience of 2019 Lightning with Sphinx routing and AMP.

<A HREF="https://cornwarecjp.github.io/amiko-pay/doc/amiko_draft_2.pdf">https://cornwarecjp.github.io/amiko-pay/doc/amiko_draft_2.pdf</A>

(esp. section 2.1.3)

Please forgive the use of the term &quot;Ripple&quot;. 2013 was a different time.

</I>&gt;<i> Every Trampoline node in the route may aggregate an incoming

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; /&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \ /&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \
</I>&gt;<i> Alice ----- 3mBTC ------&gt; Ted ------ 4mBTC ----&gt; Terry ----- 6mBTC
</I>&gt;<i> ----&gt; Bob
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;\&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;/
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; `------- 2mBTC ----------'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this example, Alice only has small-ish channels to Ted so she has
</I>&gt;<i> to split in 3 parts. Ted has good outgoing&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> capacity to Terry so he's able to split in only two parts. And Terry
</I>&gt;<i> has a big channel to Bob so he doesn't need&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> to split at all.
</I>&gt;<i> This is interesting because each intermediate Trampoline node has
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of his local channels balances,
</I>&gt;<i> thus can make more informed decisions than Alice on how to efficiently
</I>&gt;<i> split to reach the next node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it doesn't stop there. Trampoline also enables a better
</I>&gt;<i> rendez-vous routing than normal payments.
</I>&gt;<i> Christian has done most of the hard work to figure out how we could do
</I>&gt;<i> rendez-vous on top of Sphinx [1]
</I>&gt;<i> (thanks Christian!), so I won't detail that here (but I do plan on
</I>&gt;<i> submitting a detailed spec proposal with all&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> the crypto equations and nice diagrams someday, unless Christian does
</I>&gt;<i> it first).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the issues with rendez-vous routing is that once Alice (the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient) has created her part of the onion,
</I>&gt;<i> she needs to communicate that to Bob (the sender). If we use a Bolt 11
</I>&gt;<i> invoice for that, it means we need to
</I>&gt;<i> put 1366 additional bytes to the invoice (plus some additional
</I>&gt;<i> information for the ephemeral key switch).
</I>&gt;<i> If the amount Alice wants to receive is big and may require
</I>&gt;<i> multi-part, Alice has to decide upfront on how to split&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> and provide multiple pre-encrypted onions (so we need 1366 bytes /per
</I>&gt;<i> partial payment/, which kinda sucks).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But guess what? Bitcoin&#160;Trampoline fixes that*&#8482;*. Instead of doing the
</I>&gt;<i> pre-encryption on a normal onion, Alice
</I>&gt;<i> would do the pre-encryption on a Trampoline onion (which is much
</I>&gt;<i> smaller, in my prototype it's 466 bytes).
</I>&gt;<i> And that allows rendez-vous routing to benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> Trampoline's&#160;ability to do multi-part at each hop.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously since the onion is smaller, that limits the number of
</I>&gt;<i> trampoline hops that can be used, but don't
</I>&gt;<i> forget that there are additional &quot;normal&quot; hops between each Trampoline
</I>&gt;<i> node (and the final Trampoline spec&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> can choose the size of the Trampoline onion to enable a good enough
</I>&gt;<i> rendez-vous).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is what it would look like. Alice chooses to rendez-vous at
</I>&gt;<i> Terry. Alice wants the payment to go through Terry
</I>&gt;<i> and Teddy so she pre-encrypts a Trampoline onion with that route:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alice&#160;&lt;--- Teddy &lt;--- Terry
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> She creates a Bolt 11 invoice containing that pre-encrypted onion. Bob
</I>&gt;<i> picks up that invoice and can either reach&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Terry directly (via a normal payment route) or via another Trampoline
</I>&gt;<i> node (Toad?). Bob finalizes the encryption of&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> the Trampoline onion and sends it onward. Bob can use multi-part and
</I>&gt;<i> split the payment however he wishes,&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> because every Trampoline node in the route will be free to aggregate
</I>&gt;<i> and re-split differently.
</I>&gt;<i> Terry is the only intermediate node to know that rendez-vous routing
</I>&gt;<i> was used. Terry doesn't learn anything about&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Alice because the payment still needs to go through Teddy. Teddy only
</I>&gt;<i> learns that this is a Trampoline payment, so&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> he doesn't know his position in the Trampoline route (especially since
</I>&gt;<i> he doesn't know that rendez-vous was used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this makes rendez-vous routing reasonable to implement: the
</I>&gt;<i> trade-offs aren't as strong as in the normal
</I>&gt;<i> payment case. If I missed something (maybe other issues related to the
</I>&gt;<i> current rendez-vous proposal) please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course Trampoline itself also has trade-offs that in some cases may
</I>&gt;<i> impact privacy (e.g. when paying to legacy nodes&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> that don't understand the Trampoline onion). This is why Eclair is
</I>&gt;<i> currently implementing it to identify all the places where
</I>&gt;<i> it falls short, so that we can then leverage the community's amazing
</I>&gt;<i> brain power to converge on a spec that everyone is&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> happy with and that minimizes the trade-offs we need to make. Stay
</I>&gt;<i> tuned for more information and updates to the spec PR&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> once we make progress on our Trampoline experiments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for reading this, don't hesitate to throw ideas and/or
</I>&gt;<i> criticize this proposal.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Note that all the cryptographic details are left as an exercise to the
</I>&gt;<i> reader.
