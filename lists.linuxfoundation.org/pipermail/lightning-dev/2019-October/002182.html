&gt;<i> I rather strongly oppose output tagging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The entire point of for example Taproot was to reduce the variability
</I>&gt;<i> of how outputs look like, so that unspent Taproot outputs look exactly
</I>&gt;<i> like other unspent Taproot outputs regardless of the SCRIPT (or lack
</I>&gt;<i> of SCRIPT) used to protect the outputs.  That is the reason why we
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer to not support P2SH-wrapped Taproot even though
</I>&gt;<i> P2SH-wrapping was intended to cover all future uses of SegWit,
</I>&gt;<i> including SegWit v1 that Taproot will eventually get.
</I>
That is a bit reductive if you ask me. Taproot brings a number of
improvements such as the reduction of on-chain footprint in the
collaborative spend case, the hiding of complex logic in that case, and
yes, the uniformity of UTXOs that you mentioned. I do agree that it'd be
to make everything look identical to the outside observer, but saying
that separating outputs into two coarse-grained domains is equivalent to
throwing the baby out with the bath-water :-)

That being said, I should clarify that I would prefer not having to make
special accomodations on top of the raw sighash_noinput proposal, for
some perceived, but abstract danger that someone might shoot themselves
in the foot. I think we're all old enough not to need too much
handholding :-)

Output tagging is my second choice, since it minimizes the need for
people to get creative to work around other proposals, and minimizes the
on-chain footprint, and finally chaperone signatures are my least
preferred option due to its heavy-handed nature and the increased cost.

&gt;<i> Indeed, if it is output tagging that gets into Bitcoin base layer, I
</I>&gt;<i> would strongly suggest the below for all Decker-Russell-Osuntokun
</I>&gt;<i> implementations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * A standard MuSig 2-of-2 bip-schnorr SegWit v1 Funding Transaction Output, confirmed onchain
</I>&gt;<i> * A &quot;translator transaction&quot; spending the above and paying out to a SegWit v16 output-tagged output, kept offchain.
</I>&gt;<i> * Decker-Russell-Osuntokun update transaction, signed with `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` spending the translator transaction output.
</I>&gt;<i> * Decker-Russell-Osuntokun state transaction, signed with `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` spending the update transaction output.
</I>
That is very much how I was planning to implement it anyway, using a
trigger transaction to separate timeout start and the actual
update/settlement pairs (cfr. eltoo paper Section 4.2). So for eltoo
there shouldn't be an issue here :-)

&gt;<i> The point regarding use of a commonly-known privkey to work around
</I>&gt;<i> chaperone signatures is appropriate to the above, incidentally.  In
</I>&gt;<i> short: this is a workaround, plain and simple, and one wonders the
</I>&gt;<i> point of adding *either* chaperones *or* output tagging if we will, in
</I>&gt;<i> practice, just work around them anyway.
</I>
Exactly, why introduce the extra burden of chaperone signatures or
output tagging if we're just going to sidestep it?

&gt;<i> Again, the *more* important point is that special blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> constructions should only be used in the &quot;bad&quot; unilateral close case.
</I>&gt;<i> In the cooperative case, we want to use simple plain
</I>&gt;<i> bip-schnorr-signed outputs getting spent to further bip-schnor/Taproot
</I>&gt;<i> SegWit v1 addresses, to increase the anonymity set of all uses of
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun and other applications that might use
</I>&gt;<i> `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` in some edge case (but which resolve down to simple
</I>&gt;<i> bip-schnorr-signed n-of-n cases when the protocol is completed
</I>&gt;<i> successfully by all participants).
</I>
While I do agree that we should keep outputs as unidentifiable as
possible, I am starting to question whether that is possible for
off-chain payment networks since we are gossiping about the existence of
channels and binding them to outpoints to prove their existence anyway.

Not the strongest argument I know, but there's little point in talking
ideal cases when we need to weaken that later again. 

&gt;&gt;<i> Open questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ---------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The questions that remain to be addressed are the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.  General agreement on the usefulness of noinput / anyprevoutanyscript /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     anyprevout. While at the CoreDev meeting I think everybody agreed that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     these proposals a useful, also beyond eltoo, not everybody could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     there. I'd therefore like to elicit some feedback from the wider community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly agree that `NOINPUT` is useful, and I was not able to attend CoreDev (at least, not with any human fleshbot already known to you --- I checked).
</I>
Great, good to know that I'm not shouting into the void, and that I'm
not just that crazy guy trying to get his hairbrained scheme to work :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> 2.  Is there strong support or opposition to the chaperone signatures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     introduced in anyprevout / anyprevoutanyscript? I think it'd be best to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     formulate a concrete set of pros and contras, rather than talk about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     abstract dangers or advantages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No opposition, we will just work around this by publishing a common
</I>&gt;<i> known private key to use for all chaperone signatures, since all the
</I>&gt;<i> important security is in the `NOINPUT` signature anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.  The same for output tagging / explicit opt-in. What are the advantages and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     disadvantages?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Strongly oppose, see above about my argument.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.  Shall we merge BIP-118 and bip-anyprevout. This would likely reduce the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     confusion and make for simpler discussions in the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ambivalent, mildly support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5.  Anything I forgot to mention :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cats are very interesting creatures, and are irrelevant to `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` discussion, but are extremely cute nonetheless.
</I>
Definitely agreed :+1:
