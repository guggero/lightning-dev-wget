<PRE>Hi Thread,

I made a reply to the OP but didn't &quot;reply all&quot; so it just went directly to
Ethan. Since the comments were interesting I'll attempt to salvage them by
posting them in full:

== Lloyd's post ==
Hi Ethan,

I'd be interested to know what protocols you need OP_CAT for. I'm trying to
figure out if there really exists any script based protocol that doesn't
have a more efficient scriptless counterpart.  For example,
A&#178;L[1] achieves the same thing as Tumblebit but requires no script. I can
imagine paying based on a merkle path could be useful, but a protocol was
recently suggested on lightning-dev [2] that does this but without OP_CAT
(and without any script!).

== Ethan's response ==
Hi Lloyd,

Thanks for your response. I am not sure if you intended to take this off
list or not.

I plan to at some point to enumerate in detail protocols that OP_CAT would
benefit. A more important point is that OP_CAT is a basic building block
and that we don't know what future protocols it would allow. In my own
research I have avoiding going down certain paths because it isn't worth
the time to investigate knowing that OP_CAT wouldn't make the protocol
practical.

In regards to scriptless scripts they almost always require an interactive
protocol and sometimes ZKPs. A2L is very impressive but like TumbleBit it
places a large burden on the developer. Additionally I am aware of no way
to reveal a subset of preimages with scriptless scripts, do a conditioned
reveal i.e. these preimages can only spend under these two pubkeys and
timelockA where after timelockZ this other pubkey can spend without a
preimages. Scriptless scripts are a fantastic tool but they shouldn't be
the only tool that we have.

I'm not sure I follow what you are saying with [2]

This brings me back a philosophical point:
Bitcoin should give people basic tools to build protocols without first
knowing what all those protocols are especially when those tools have very
little downside.

I really appreciate your comments.

Thanks,
Ethan

*Back to normal thread*

Hi Ethan,

Thanks for the insightful reply and sorry for my mailing list errors.

&gt;<i> I plan to at some point to enumerate in detail protocols that OP_CAT
</I>would benefit.

Sweet. Thanks.

&gt;<i> Additionally I am aware of no way to reveal a subset of preimages with
</I>scriptless scripts, do a conditioned reveal i.e. these preimages can only
spend under these two pubkeys and timelockA where after timelockZ this
other pubkey can spend without a preimages. Scriptless scripts are a
fantastic tool but they shouldn't be the only tool that we have.

Yes. With adaptor signatures there is no way to reveal more than one
pre-image; you are limited to revealing a single scalar. But you can have
multiple transactions spending from the same output, each with a different
set of scriptless conditions (absolute time locks, relative time locks and
pre-image reveal). This is enough to achieve what I think you are
describing. FWIW there's a growing consensus that you can do lightning
without script [1]. Perhaps we can't do everything with this technique. My
current focus is figuring out what useful things we can't do like this
(even if we were to go wild and add whatever opcodes we wanted). So far it
looks like covenants are the main exception.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure I follow what you are saying with [2]
</I>
That is perfectly understandable as I linked the wrong thread (sorry!).
Here's the right one:
<A HREF="https://www.mail-archive.com/lightning-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg01427.html">https://www.mail-archive.com/lightning-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg01427.html</A>

I was pointing to the surprising result that you can actually pay for a
merkle path with a particular merkle root leading to a particular leaf that
you're interested in without validating the merkle path on chain (e.g.
OP_CAT and OP_SHA256). The catch is that the leaves have to be pedersen
commitments and you prove the existence of your data in the merkle root by
showing an opening to the leaf pedersen commitment. This may not be general
enough to cover every merkle tree use case (but I'm not sure what those
are!).

&gt;<i> This brings me back a philosophical point:
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin should give people basic tools to build protocols without first
</I>knowing what all those protocols are especially when those tools have very
little downside.

This is a really powerful idea. But I've started feeling like you have to
just design the layer 2 protocols first and then design layer 1! It seems
like almost every protocol that people want to make requires very
particular fundamental changes: SegWit for LN-penalty and NOINPUT for eltoo
for example. On top of that it seems like just having the right signature
scheme (schnorr) at layer 1 is enough to enable most useful stuff in an
elegant way.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good morning lists,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me propose the below radical idea:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * `SIGHASH` flags attached to signatures are a misdesign, sadly retained
</I>&gt;<i> from the original BitCoin 0.1.0 Alpha for Windows design, on par with:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * `OP_CAT` and `OP_MULT` and `OP_ADD` and friends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * transaction malleability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * probably many more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So let me propose the more radical excision, starting with SegWit v1:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Remove `SIGHASH` from signatures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Put `SIGHASH` on public keys.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Public keys are now encoded as either 33-bytes (implicit `SIGHASH_ALL`)
</I>&gt;<i> or 34-bytes (`SIGHASH` byte, followed by pubkey type, followed by pubkey
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `OP_CHECKSIG` and friends then look at the *public key* to determine
</I>&gt;<i> sighash algorithm rather than the signature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As we expect public keys to be indirectly committed to on every output
</I>&gt;<i> `scriptPubKey`, this is automatically output tagging to allow particular
</I>&gt;<i> `SIGHASH`.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, we can then utilize the many many ways to hide public keys away
</I>&gt;<i> until they are needed, exemplified in MAST-inside-Taproot.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I propose also the addition of the opcode:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;sighash&gt; &lt;pubkey&gt; OP_SETPUBKEYSIGHASH
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * `sighash` must be one byte.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * `pubkey` may be the special byte `0x1`, meaning &quot;just use the Taproot
</I>&gt;<i> internal pubkey&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * `pubkey` may be 33-byte public key, in which case the `sighash` byte
</I>&gt;<i> is just prepended to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * `pubkey` may be 34-byte public key with sighash, in which case the
</I>&gt;<i> first byte is replaced with `sighash` byte.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * If `sighash` is `0x00` then the result is a 33-byte public key (the
</I>&gt;<i> sighash byte is removed) i.e. `SIGHASH_ALL` implicit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This retains the old feature where the sighash is selected at
</I>&gt;<i> time-of-spending rather than time-of-payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is done by using the script:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;pubkey&gt; OP_SETPUBKEYSIGHASH OP_CHECKSIG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then the sighash can be put in the witness stack after the signature,
</I>&gt;<i> letting the `SIGHASH` flag be selected at time-of-signing, but only if the
</I>&gt;<i> SCRIPT specifically is formed to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is malleability-safe as the signature still commits to the
</I>&gt;<i> `SIGHASH` it was created for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, by default, public keys will not have an attached `SIGHASH`
</I>&gt;<i> byte, implying `SIGHASH_ALL` (and disallowing-by-default non-`SIGHASH_ALL`).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This removes the problems with `SIGHASH_NONE` `SIGHASH_SINGLE`, as they
</I>&gt;<i> are allowed only if the output specifically says they are allowed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would this not be a superior solution?
