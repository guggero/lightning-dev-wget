<PRE>Hi Nadav,

I've thought about similar problems before. Essentially you are trying to
create an &quot;access structure&quot; on discrete logarithm (the completion of the
adaptor signature in &quot;pay-to-point&quot;). I think the term for arbitrary
combinations of AND and ORs and even N-of-M is called a *monotone
access structure*.

&gt;<i> Essentially the idea is to use the point S + ECDH(B, E) where S is the
</I>seller's point, B is the buyer's point and E is the escrow's point

I can't see how you can create an access structure like this with ECDH.
Neither B nor E know the discrete log of ECDH(B,E). I can see that you can
hash it and use it as a scalar but then you have to make a heavy zkp to
prove the validity (or interact with the escrow which violates the premise).

Fortunately, I think it is possible to create any monotone access structure
on a discrete logarithm using *verifiable encryption*.  Applying this to
the Escrow payment problem, the buyer decides on the payment point B and
verifiably encrypts the discrete logarithm of B under the Escrow's public
key E and sends the encryption to the seller. If there's a dispute, the
seller sends the encryption to the Escrow. If the Escrow resolve the
dispute in favour of the seller they just decrypt the ciphertext and send
the discrete log of B to the seller. The seller can now redeem the payment.

If we want to create more complex access structures then we use verifiable
secret sharing where the discrete log of B is split up into shares and
distributed according the the desired structure.

So how do we do this verifiable encryption/secret sharing? Well it's not
really straight forward. In the case of Escrow, Camenisch-Shoup [1]
verifiable encryption might be attractive since the Escrow can be trusted
to produce the Paillier modulus properly. Otherwise there's
Camenisch-Damgaard [2] which is much less efficient but only relies on CDH
assumption. As far as I know there are no usable implementations of either
of these schemes but Camenisch-Damgaard is relatively straightforward and I
think it's practical.

&gt;<i>  Hi list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm back again with another idea about Payment Points and fun things to do
</I>&gt;<i> with them! Hopefully this time I'm not entirely just hashing out old ideas
</I>&gt;<i> in public like an out-of-the-loop person :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *TLDR: Adding and ECDH-ing points gives us AND and OR functionality which
</I>&gt;<i> we can compose to make cool lightning contracts like Multisig, Escrow, and
</I>&gt;<i> DLCs*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So when looking at the following (likely incomplete) list of things you
</I>&gt;<i> can do with payment points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Payment De-correlation
</I>&gt;<i> 2) &quot;Stuckless&quot; Payments
</I>&gt;<i> 3) High AMP
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Selling Signatures
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Selling Pedersen De-commitment
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Escrow Contracts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started of trying to classify what kind of thing these new features are
</I>&gt;<i> in hopes of coming across new ones. The first three I clumped into a group
</I>&gt;<i> I called &quot;Payment point addition allows us to do cool things while
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining the Proof of Payment (PoP) property&quot;. The next two (4 and 5) I
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;Commitment applications where point is public&quot;. But ZmnSCPxj's
</I>&gt;<i> proposal for lightning escrow contracts (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../2019-June/002028.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-June/002028.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> struck me as something different that might somehow be made more general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially the idea is to use the point S + ECDH(B, E) where S is the
</I>&gt;<i> seller's point, B is the buyer's point and E is the escrow's point. This
</I>&gt;<i> means that the scalar can be discovered by the seller in collaboration with
</I>&gt;<i> the buyer or the escrow, that is, S AND (B OR E). I propose that under
</I>&gt;<i> certain circumstances (such as the parties involved being able to
</I>&gt;<i> interact), this can be generalized to have payments conditioned on
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary AND/OR circuits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I believe that AND is very straightforward as you simply take two
</I>&gt;<i> conditions A and B and add them together to get a point that requires both
</I>&gt;<i> of their scalars are discoverable (except maybe under certain bad
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances that can be avoided where like B = C - A, this must be
</I>&gt;<i> guarded against).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OR is harder but I think that it can be achieved in the two party case by
</I>&gt;<i> ECDH and in the n-party case by multi-party key exchanges (which I know
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much nothing about other than that they exist). Given some key
</I>&gt;<i> exchange protocol (preferably non-interactive), KE, KE(A_1, ..., A_n)
</I>&gt;<i> should result in a number known only to those who know any scalar a_1, ...,
</I>&gt;<i> a_n and no one else. Assuming this exists and we can manage to trustlessly
</I>&gt;<i> (in some possibly stretched sense of the word) compute shared keys
</I>&gt;<i> (including such things as KE(A+B, C)), then KE(A, B) acts as A OR B in our
</I>&gt;<i> payment condition contract.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To restate the escrow contract idea in this setting, the payment is
</I>&gt;<i> conditioned on S + KE(B, E). Important to note is that not all parties must
</I>&gt;<i> know about the details of the payment itself: the Escrow in this example
</I>&gt;<i> knows nothing about this payment (other than that some payment exists)
</I>&gt;<i> unless there is a dispute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, note that contracts following this scheme look indistinguishable
</I>&gt;<i> to normal payments on the network, and are fully compatible with High AMPs
</I>&gt;<i> since we can simply take the payment point specified by our contract and
</I>&gt;<i> add that point to each partial payment point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well this is all nice in theory, but is there anything that will actually
</I>&gt;<i> come out of this thinking? I'll detail the two things I've thought of so
</I>&gt;<i> far for which I'd love critique! I'd also love to hear if anyone else
</I>&gt;<i> things of any cool application using this line of thought (or really
</I>&gt;<i> anything cool with payment points :P).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Idea 1: &quot;MultiSignature&quot; Lightning Contracts
</I>&gt;<i> I mean &quot;MultiSignature&quot; here only in the sense that m-of-n parties must
</I>&gt;<i> agree to the payment in order for it to happen, no actual signatures are
</I>&gt;<i> used. A &quot;MultiSignature&quot; contract is simply a bunch of ANDs and ORs! For
</I>&gt;<i> example a 2-of-3 multisig between parties A, B, and C can be represented as
</I>&gt;<i> (A AND B) OR (B AND C) OR (C AND A). As such, if some seller has a point S
</I>&gt;<i> and three parties have points A, B, and C where a certain payment must go
</I>&gt;<i> through if any two of them think it should, then the payment point used for
</I>&gt;<i> the payment should be S + KE(A + B, B + C, C + A). We add S to this point
</I>&gt;<i> so that the scalar, s, can act as proof of payment. And that's it! I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't thought long enough to come up with any situation where this might
</I>&gt;<i> be useful but hoping someone who reads this will!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Idea 2: DLCs Routed over Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> Say that some DLC oracle will either broadcast s_A or s_B whose public
</I>&gt;<i> points are S_A and S_B (which can be computed from public information as
</I>&gt;<i> per the DLC scheme). Then say that Alice and Bob enter into a contract
</I>&gt;<i> under which Alice wins some amount if s_A is broadcasted and Bob if s_B is
</I>&gt;<i> broadcasted. Say Alice has a point A and Bob has a point B. They each send
</I>&gt;<i> the other a payment with the amount that party must receive if they win
</I>&gt;<i> with the payment point A + S_A for Bob's payment to Alice and B + S_B for
</I>&gt;<i> Alice's payment to Bob. And this is it! If s_A is broadcasted then Alice
</I>&gt;<i> gets paid (and Bob gets proof of payment a, which is the scalar to A),
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise s_B is broadcasted and Bob gets paid (with Alice receiving b as
</I>&gt;<i> PoP). An interesting note is that under this scheme neither party is forced
</I>&gt;<i> to pay extra on-chain fees in the case of a counter-party who doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate whilst in the wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> One wrinkle with this scheme is that setup isn't trustless. Although it is
</I>&gt;<i> generally true that one party must sign the funding transaction for a DLC
</I>&gt;<i> before the other party for on-chain DLCs, at least there is the mitigation
</I>&gt;<i> that when your counter-party goes silent, you can move your input funds
</I>&gt;<i> invalidating the funding transaction you signed (at a cost because fees).
</I>&gt;<i> So what can we do here to ensure that both payments are setup at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time in the case that Alice and Bob don't trust each other?
</I>&gt;<i> Say that although they don't trust each other, they're both willing to
</I>&gt;<i> trust some escrow entity who generates some point E for their payment.
</I>&gt;<i> Alice's payment point to Bob becomes B + S_B + E and Bob's to Alice becomes
</I>&gt;<i> A + S_A + E. The escrow now waits to hear from Alice and Bob that they have
</I>&gt;<i> incoming payments setup and only once both of them attest to this (using
</I>&gt;<i> signatures, for example) does the escrow release the scalar to E to them
</I>&gt;<i> both. The escrow can also have a timeout at which it will never reveal the
</I>&gt;<i> scalar to E: forcing both parties to commit to the contract well before the
</I>&gt;<i> DLC event. In this way, trust has been moved from counter-party to
</I>&gt;<i> trustworthy (hopefully) escrow in such a way that the Escrow learns nothing
</I>&gt;<i> about the contract itself (other than that there is one of some kind).
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that this scheme can be extended to more events through the use
</I>&gt;<i> of multiple payments being setup (usually in both directions) but this
</I>&gt;<i> seems complicated and I've rambled for long enough. One last note is that
</I>&gt;<i> DLC oracles can be composed in the usual way under this scheme (by
</I>&gt;<i> addition) and potentially even threshold multi-oracles can be supported in
</I>&gt;<i> this way, although this would require the oracles to attest to some shared
</I>&gt;<i> key's points with other oracles which isn't necessarily optimal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Nadav
