</I>
Hmm? If you have a CSV lock, it can&#8217;t be used for carve-out/CPFP period. I don&#8217;t see why this doesn&#8217;t work. We definitely should stick to this.

&gt;&gt;<i> * For the keys to use for `to_remote_anchor` and `to_local_anchor`, we=E2=
</I>&gt;<i> =80=99d
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to introduce new addresses that both parties communicate in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `open_channel` and `accept_channel` messages. We don=E2=80=99t want to re=
</I>&gt;<i> use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main commitment output addresses, because those may (at some point) be co=
</I>&gt;<i> ld
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> storage addresses and the cpfp is likely to happen from a hot wallet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is horribly spammy.  At the moment we see ~ one unilateral close
</I>&gt;<i> every 3 blocks.  Hopefully that will reduce, but there'll always be
</I>&gt;<i> some.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Within each version of the commitment transaction, both anchors always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have equal values and are paid for by the initiator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who pays if they can't afford it?  What if they push_msat everything to
</I>&gt;<i> the other side?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The value of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anchors is the dust limit that was negotiated in the `open_channel` or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `accept_channel` message of the party that publishes the transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now initiator has to care about the other side's dust limit, which is
</I>&gt;<i> bad.  And as accepter I now want this much higher, since I get those
</I>&gt;<i> funds instantly.  I don't think we gain anything by making this
</I>&gt;<i> configurable at all; just pick a number and be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere between 1000 and 10,000 sat is a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, there doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be a compelling reason anymore=
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tweaking the keys (new insights into watchtower designs, encrypt by txid).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not correct.  This seems more like &quot;forgotten insights&quot; than &quot;new
</I>&gt;<i> insights&quot;, which isn't surprising how long ago Tadge and I did the
</I>&gt;<i> watchtower design (BTW: I was the one who came up with encrypt by
</I>&gt;<i> txid for that!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are several design constraints in the original watchtowers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A watchtower shouldn't be able to guess the channel history.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. ... even if it sees a unilateral tx.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. ... even if it sees a revoked unilateral tx it has a penalty for.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. A watchtower shouldn't be able to tell if it's being used for both
</I>&gt;<i>   parties in the same channel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't rotate keys, a watchtower can brute-force the HTLCs for all
</I>&gt;<i> previous transactions it was told about, and previous channel balances.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We removed key rotation on the to-remote output because you can simply
</I>&gt;<i> not tell the watchtower about txs which don't have anything but an
</I>&gt;<i> output to you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the options I see:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Abandon privacy from watchtowers and don't rotate keys.  Watchtowers
</I>&gt;<i>   will be able to brute-force your history if they see a unilateral
</I>&gt;<i>   close.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Remove HTLC output key rotation, and assume watchtowers don't handle
</I>&gt;<i>   HTLCs (so you don't tell them about early txs where the peer has no
</I>&gt;<i>   output but there are HTLCs pending).  This seems less useful, since
</I>&gt;<i>   HTLC txs require metadata anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Change to-local key rotation to use BIP32 (unhardened).  We could
</I>&gt;<i>   also take some of the 48 bits (maybe 24?) we currently use to encode
</I>&gt;<i>   the commitment number, to encode a BIP32 sub-path for this channel.
</I>&gt;<i>   This would make it easier for hardware wallets to reconstruct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
