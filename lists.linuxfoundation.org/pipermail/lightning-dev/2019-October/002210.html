</I>
In even that degenerate case allocators also free memory.

Anyway, every execution step in script evaluation has a maximum output size,
and the number of steps is limited. At worst you can allocate the entire
possible stack up-front for relatively little cost (eg fitting in the MB or two
that is a common size for L2 cache).

</I>
256 bytes is more than enough for even the most complex summed merkle tree with
512-byte hashes and full-sized sum commitments. Yet that's still less than the
~500byte limit proposed elsewhere.
