<PRE>Hi Konstantin,

This looks cool and I haven't had a chance yet to spend time with the idea,
but I would like to add that you can likely solve the PoP problem mentioned
under potential issues by having S pay B with an AMP-like setup. We use the
point B + x*G on one payment where x is a nonce generated by S, and the
point B + s*G + x*G on the other payment. The nonce, x, is revealed to the
signature seller only when they receive both onions. This way when the
payment completes, S learns b + x and b + x + s so that they can compute b
= (b + x) - x and s = (b + x + s) - (b + x). s is the signature that they
wanted and b is the PoP.

Best,
Nadav

&gt;<i> ## Problem
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, both parties have to be online at the same time to send/
</I>&gt;<i> receive money. This can be avoided by using something like the Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> Rod Protocol by Breez (<A HREF="https://github.com/breez/LightningRod">https://github.com/breez/LightningRod</A>). However,
</I>&gt;<i> funds have to be locked up longer than usual. We can do better than that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Solution
</I>&gt;<i> The payer A pre-signs a transaction handing over money to their local
</I>&gt;<i> channel partner S and sends the transaction to the payee B in an end to end
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted communication channel. B can then sell the signature for the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction to S using pay-for-signature made possible by payment points
</I>&gt;<i> and scalars. (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../2019-July/002077.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-July/002077.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will be using eltoo because we don't have to worry about toxic channel
</I>&gt;<i> states.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A and S are online, A and S have a channel
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A contacts S: they commit and exchange the R (= k*G) part of the
</I>&gt;<i> Schnorr Signature for the update and settlement transaction
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A and S sign the settlement transaction increasing the balance between
</I>&gt;<i> them by amt + fee in favor of S and exchange the signatures
</I>&gt;<i> 3. A signs the corresponding update transaction but does not give it so S
</I>&gt;<i> 4. A sends the update transaction to B using an end to end encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous communication channel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A can go offline
</I>&gt;<i> B comes online
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Decrypts the update transaction and sells the signature s to S for amt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When A comes back online S gives A the invoice (with the payment point
</I>&gt;<i> s*G) signed by B, the corresponding scalar s (the signature from A for the
</I>&gt;<i> update transaction) and signature from S for the update transaction. They
</I>&gt;<i> can now proceed as normal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to enabling asynchronous payments, this outsources the routing
</I>&gt;<i> to S.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ### Potential issues
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### Privacy
</I>&gt;<i> S currently knows both the sender and the receiver of the payment. If we
</I>&gt;<i> split the payment from S to B into two payments between S and a public
</I>&gt;<i> routing node P and P and B by still using the same scalar + payment point,
</I>&gt;<i> S now only knows the sender and P only knows the receiver. To further
</I>&gt;<i> increase privacy we can split the payment multiple times but all nodes
</I>&gt;<i> involved must support this feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### Locked up capital
</I>&gt;<i> While B hasn't yet claimed its money, the funds in the channel between A
</I>&gt;<i> and S are essentially locked up. However, A and S could simply overwrite
</I>&gt;<i> the payment (new update + settlement transaction), then A could send
</I>&gt;<i> multiple payments with the remaining balance and before going offline A
</I>&gt;<i> would do the procedure again. If A has sufficient inbound capacity in other
</I>&gt;<i> channels it can also re-balance its channel A-S so that the outbound
</I>&gt;<i> capacity - (amt + fees) in this channel is zero and then do the procedure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### Communication channel
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, the communication channel must be end to end encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise this is highly insecure. Hopefully, we will have a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized paid mail server system which is compatible across all LN
</I>&gt;<i> wallets and part of BOLT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #### Proof of payment
</I>&gt;<i> The invoice by B with the payment point s*G and s are not sufficient as a
</I>&gt;<i> PoP because S can simply give A the invoice and A already knows s.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## the other way around
</I>&gt;<i> We can also do it in a way that A can instantly send B (who is offline)
</I>&gt;<i> money but now A is in charge of enforcing the channel state if S cheats.
</I>&gt;<i> Because it has more issues like who pays the transaction fees if S cheats
</I>&gt;<i> and because I believe Lightning is generally not designed for people who
</I>&gt;<i> are offline for a long time I prefer the first one. But here is the other
</I>&gt;<i> one:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B and S are online, B and S have a channel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. B and S sign a new settlement transaction increasing balance in favor
</I>&gt;<i> of B by amt
</I>&gt;<i> 2. B signs the corresponding update transaction, encrypts it and sends it
</I>&gt;<i> together with the settlement transaction to A
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B can go offline
</I>&gt;<i> A comes online
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. A decrypts the transactions, A pays S to sign the update transaction
</I>&gt;<i> which makes this new channel state valid/ enforceable
</I>&gt;<i> 4. now A essentially acts like a watchtower while B is offline
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ## Conclusion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This enables truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and is yet
</I>&gt;<i> another reason to move to payment points and scalars.
</I>&gt;<i>
