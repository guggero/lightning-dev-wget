For me, the thing that distinguishes ANYPREVOUT/NOINPUT as warranting
an opt-in step is that it affects the security of potentially many
UTXOs at once; whereas all the other combinations (ALL,SINGLE,NONE
cross ALL,ANYONECANPAY) still commit to the specific UTXO being spent,
so at most you only risk somehow losing the funds from the specific UTXO
you're working with (apart from the SINGLE bug, which taproot doesn't
support anyway).

Having a meaningful prefix on the taproot scriptpubkey (ie paying to
&quot;[SIGHASH_SINGLE][32B pubkey]&quot;) seems like it would make it a bit easier
to distinguish wallets, which taproot otherwise avoids -- &quot;oh this address
is going to be a SIGHASH_SINGLE? probably some hacker, let's ban it&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think it might be good to have a public testnet (based on Richard Myers

</I>&gt;<i> That'd be great, however even that will not ensure that every possible
</I>&gt;<i> corner case is handled [...]
</I>
Well, sure. I'm thinking of it more as a *necessary* step than a
*sufficient* one, though. If we can't demonstrate that we can deal with
the theoretical attacks people have dreamt up in a &quot;laboratory&quot; setting,
then it doesn't make much sense to deploy things in a real world setting,
does it?

I think if it turns out that we can handle every case we can think of
easily, that will be good evidence that output tagging and the like isn't
necessary; and conversely if it turns out we can't handle them easily,
it at least gives us a chance to see how output tagging (or chaperone
sigs, or whatever else) would actually work, and if they'd provide any
meaningful protection at all. At the moment the best we've got is ideas
and handwaving...

Cheers,
aj
