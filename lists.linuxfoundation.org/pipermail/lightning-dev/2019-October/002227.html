<PRE>Good morning,

&gt;<i> * Sub-payment - one or more attempts, each of which semantically pay
</I>for &quot;the same thing&quot; for &quot;the same value&quot;, set up in parallel.
&gt;<i> a sub-payment may have multiple attempts running in parallel, but only
</I>one attempt will be claimable.
&gt;<i> * Payment - one or more sub-payments, each of which semantically pay
</I>for &quot;different parts of an entire thing&quot;, set up in parallel.
&gt;<i> a payment may have multiple sub-payments, and all sub-payments will be
</I>claimed atomically.

This can be also thought of as:

Payment = ONE-OF(attempt_11, ..., attempt_m1) AND ... AND
ONE-OF(attempt_n1, ..., attempt_m'n)

Its dual also deserves some thought:

Payment = ONE-OF(attempt_11 AND ... AND attempt_m1), ..., (attempt_n1
AND ... AND attempt_m'n))

or in words, &quot;A payment is an atomic value transfer through many paths,
each of which carry a part of the entire value -- many alternative
groups of paths are available to be used, but only one of the groups
eventually goes through.&quot;

Is there a reason to design in preference of one of the two?

Speaking of generalization, it would be nice to have arbitrary AND-OR
combinations, but this needs further exploration:

&gt;<i> If we want to create more complex access structures then we use
</I>verifiable secret sharing where the discrete log of B is split up into
shares and distributed according the the desired structure.

One possible milestone of this generalisation would be to enable atomic
payments where the paying wallet says &quot;there are all these known paths,
each with such and such capacity; I want some to go through such that
the desired value is transferred in aggregate, no more, no less
(possibly within a margin of error)&quot;.

Kindly ignore me if I'm regurgitating already discussed stuff.

Best,
Orfeas
