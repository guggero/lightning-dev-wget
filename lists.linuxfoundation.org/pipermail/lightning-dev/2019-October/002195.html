<PRE>Oh darn!

My bad for posting so fast, I should have looked around more :P

Thanks for the info!

And agreed, it would be awesome to have even if just as a proof of concept.

Best,
Nadav

&gt;<i> Good morning Nadav,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like most people I am super excited for AMPs to hit the lightning
</I>&gt;<i> network!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (For the remainder of this post when I say AMP I mean OG AMP (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../2018-February/000993.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/000993.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> since that is the one I know)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is my understanding however that it is not possible to do AMPs with
</I>&gt;<i> Proof of Payment (PoP). This is because the payment pre-images must be
</I>&gt;<i> fully known to the payer since they must compute a hash of each payment
</I>&gt;<i> pre-image. And if the payer must know the pre-image in advance then there
</I>&gt;<i> is nothing for them to learn atomically with payment completion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This makes me sad because PoP is really important for many applications
</I>&gt;<i> and any application that uses PoP will not be AMP compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Queue Payment Points to the rescue! Once the lightning network moves to
</I>&gt;<i> support Payment Points and PTLCs instead of Payment Hashes with their
</I>&gt;<i> HTLCs, OG AMP can be modified in the following simple way in order to allow
</I>&gt;<i> for PoP-enabled AMPs:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Let PP = pop*G be the payment point (e.g. in an invoice) where pop
</I>&gt;<i> is known to the receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Like in the original proposal, let V be the total amount with pieces
</I>&gt;<i> v_1 through v_n.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Like in the original proposal, let BS = s_1 ^ ... ^ s_n (where I use
</I>&gt;<i> BS = Base Secret)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Like in the original proposal, let r_i = H(BS || i), but this will
</I>&gt;<i> not be our pre-image.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Instead, let the payment point for partial payment i be: P_i = r_i*G
</I>&gt;<i> + PP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     This makes each payment scalar (as opposed to pre-image) r_i + pop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The rest is the same as OG AMP: Use the triple (ID, v_i, s_i) in
</I>&gt;<i> each payment's EOB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     This allows the receiver to add pop to each r_i which is required to
</I>&gt;<i> complete each payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TLDR: Have a Payment Point, PP = pop*G, and add it to each partial
</I>&gt;<i> payment point!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once we have Payment Points I propose that this be how AMPs work (and
</I>&gt;<i> simply set PP = 0 in the case of spontaneous AMPs). This will allow AMPs to
</I>&gt;<i> enjoy all of the awesome things that come with PoP!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it is true, as I believe it to be, that it is not possible to have
</I>&gt;<i> PoP in AMPs without Payment Points, then I find this to be (yet another)
</I>&gt;<i> really compelling reason to move to Payment Points as soon as we can
</I>&gt;<i> (likely when bip-schnorr enters base layer I believe?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All feedback is welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nadav
