<PRE>## Problem
Currently, both parties have to be online at the same time to send/ receive
money. This can be avoided by using something like the Lightning Rod
Protocol by Breez (<A HREF="https://github.com/breez/LightningRod">https://github.com/breez/LightningRod</A>). However, funds
have to be locked up longer than usual. We can do better than that.

## Solution
The payer A pre-signs a transaction handing over money to their local
channel partner S and sends the transaction to the payee B in an end to end
encrypted communication channel. B can then sell the signature for the
transaction to S using pay-for-signature made possible by payment points
and scalars. (
<A HREF="../2019-July/002077.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-July/002077.html</A>)


We will be using eltoo because we don't have to worry about toxic channel
states.

A and S are online, A and S have a channel
1. A contacts S: they commit and exchange the R (= k*G) part of the Schnorr
Signature for the update and settlement transaction
2. A and S sign the settlement transaction increasing the balance between
them by amt + fee in favor of S and exchange the signatures
3. A signs the corresponding update transaction but does not give it so S
4. A sends the update transaction to B using an end to end encrypted
asynchronous communication channel

A can go offline
B comes online

4. Decrypts the update transaction and sells the signature s to S for amt

When A comes back online S gives A the invoice (with the payment point s*G)
signed by B, the corresponding scalar s (the signature from A for the
update transaction) and signature from S for the update transaction. They
can now proceed as normal.

In addition to enabling asynchronous payments, this outsources the routing
to S.

### Potential issues

#### Privacy
S currently knows both the sender and the receiver of the payment. If we
split the payment from S to B into two payments between S and a public
routing node P and P and B by still using the same scalar + payment point,
S now only knows the sender and P only knows the receiver. To further
increase privacy we can split the payment multiple times but all nodes
involved must support this feature.

#### Locked up capital
While B hasn't yet claimed its money, the funds in the channel between A
and S are essentially locked up. However, A and S could simply overwrite
the payment (new update + settlement transaction), then A could send
multiple payments with the remaining balance and before going offline A
would do the procedure again. If A has sufficient inbound capacity in other
channels it can also re-balance its channel A-S so that the outbound
capacity - (amt + fees) in this channel is zero and then do the procedure.

#### Communication channel
Obviously, the communication channel must be end to end encrypted otherwise
this is highly insecure. Hopefully, we will have a sort of decentralized
paid mail server system which is compatible across all LN wallets and part
of BOLT.

#### Proof of payment
The invoice by B with the payment point s*G and s are not sufficient as a
PoP because S can simply give A the invoice and A already knows s.

## the other way around
We can also do it in a way that A can instantly send B (who is offline)
money but now A is in charge of enforcing the channel state if S cheats.
Because it has more issues like who pays the transaction fees if S cheats
and because I believe Lightning is generally not designed for people who
are offline for a long time I prefer the first one. But here is the other
one:

B and S are online, B and S have a channel

1. B and S sign a new settlement transaction increasing balance in favor of
B by amt
2. B signs the corresponding update transaction, encrypts it and sends it
together with the settlement transaction to A

B can go offline
A comes online

3. A decrypts the transactions, A pays S to sign the update transaction
which makes this new channel state valid/ enforceable
4. now A essentially acts like a watchtower while B is offline

## Conclusion

This enables truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and is yet
another reason to move to payment points and scalars.
