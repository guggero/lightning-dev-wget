<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,

&gt;<i> I think, it is possible to make, a miniscript-like language for such
</I>things.
&gt;<i> Indeed, the only material difference, between SCRIPT-based `OP_CHECKSIG`s
</I>and Lightning, would be the requirement to reveal scalars rather than prove
your knowledge of them.

I've thought about this too. I've been pitching the language name as
&quot;Improv&quot; (since it's scriptless!). I think it would allow you to specify
the rules by which each output on each transaction can be spent and would
compile those rules into a protocol that does the secure key and signature
exchange for all the transactions in the scaffold. In other words, a
protocol compiler. I think this could be really useful for formal
specification of layer-2 protocols.

&gt;<i> Good morning Nadav,

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for this framework!
</I>&gt;<i> It seems very good idea, kudos to making this framework.

</I>&gt;<i> I think, it is possible to make, a miniscript-like language for such

</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, the only material difference, between SCRIPT-based `OP_CHECKSIG`s

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Idea 2: DLCs Routed over Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Say that some DLC oracle will either broadcast s_A or s_B whose public
</I>&gt;<i> points are S_A and S_B (which can be computed from public information as
</I>&gt;<i> per the DLC scheme). Then say that Alice and Bob enter into a contract
</I>&gt;<i> under which Alice wins some amount if s_A is broadcasted and Bob if s_B is
</I>&gt;<i> broadcasted. Say Alice has a point A and Bob has a point B. They each send
</I>&gt;<i> the other a payment with the amount that party must receive if they win
</I>&gt;<i> with the payment point A + S_A for Bob's payment to Alice and B + S_B for
</I>&gt;<i> Alice's payment to Bob. And this is it! If s_A is broadcasted then Alice
</I>&gt;<i> gets paid (and Bob gets proof of payment a, which is the scalar to A),
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise s_B is broadcasted and Bob gets paid (with Alice receiving b as
</I>&gt;<i> PoP). An interesting note is that under this scheme neither party is forced
</I>&gt;<i> to pay extra on-chain fees in the case of a counter-party who doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate whilst in the wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One wrinkle with this scheme is that setup isn't trustless. Although it
</I>&gt;<i> is generally true that one party must sign the funding transaction for a
</I>&gt;<i> DLC before the other party for on-chain DLCs, at least there is the
</I>&gt;<i> mitigation that when your counter-party goes silent, you can move your
</I>&gt;<i> input funds invalidating the funding transaction you signed (at a cost
</I>&gt;<i> because fees). So what can we do here to ensure that both payments are
</I>&gt;<i> setup at the same time in the case that Alice and Bob don't trust each
</I>&gt;<i> other?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Say that although they don't trust each other, they're both willing to
</I>&gt;<i> trust some escrow entity who generates some point E for their payment.
</I>&gt;<i> Alice's payment point to Bob becomes B + S_B + E and Bob's to Alice becomes
</I>&gt;<i> A + S_A + E. The escrow now waits to hear from Alice and Bob that they have
</I>&gt;<i> incoming payments setup and only once both of them attest to this (using
</I>&gt;<i> signatures, for example) does the escrow release the scalar to E to them
</I>&gt;<i> both. The escrow can also have a timeout at which it will never reveal the
</I>&gt;<i> scalar to E: forcing both parties to commit to the contract well before the
</I>&gt;<i> DLC event. In this way, trust has been moved from counter-party to
</I>&gt;<i> trustworthy (hopefully) escrow in such a way that the Escrow learns nothing
</I>&gt;<i> about the contract itself (other than that there is one of some kind).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can call this a &quot;barrier escrow&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * It is similar to the concept of synchronization barriers for multithread
</I>&gt;<i> coordination: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> * In effect, each sub-transaction of the entire arrangement is a &quot;thread&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> of operation, and the &quot;barrier escrow&quot; ensures that all the threads have
</I>&gt;<i> reached it before letting them continue to claim the payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I seem, this is applicable to *not only* DLC, but others as well.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, it seems to me to also provide an alternate solution to the
</I>&gt;<i> Premium-free American Call Option Problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us introduce our characters:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * B, a supposed buyer, holding some Bitcoin.
</I>&gt;<i> * S, a supposed seller, who wishes to be paid in another asset.
</I>&gt;<i> * X, a cross-currency exchange Lightning node.
</I>&gt;<i> * E, a tr\*sted escrow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> X would like to facilitate exchanges across different assets, but wants to
</I>&gt;<i> be paid a premium in order to prevent the Premium-free American Call Option
</I>&gt;<i> Problem.
</I>&gt;<i> B would like to swap its Bitcoin for another asset to pay S, and would be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to pay the above premium, but only conditional on S actually
</I>&gt;<i> getting the asset it wants to be paid in.
</I>&gt;<i> X and B are non-trusting to each other, but are willing to tr\*st escrow E.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This again is another &quot;two transactions&quot; setup, where we move tr\*st from
</I>&gt;<i> X and B and transfer it to E.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * B forwards the payment to be exchanged through X and onward to S,
</I>&gt;<i> conditional on receiving the scalar behind `S + E`.
</I>&gt;<i> * B gives a payment to X conditional on receiving the scalar behind `X +
</I>&gt;<i> E`.
</I>&gt;<i> * X continues to forward the payment, in the target asset, to S.
</I>&gt;<i> * X contacts E and requests for the secret behind `E`.
</I>&gt;<i> * S, on receiving the incoming payment, contacts E and requests for the
</I>&gt;<i> secret behind `E`.
</I>&gt;<i> * As E has now received both requests, it releases the secret
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously to both branches.
</I>&gt;<i> * S and X can now claim their payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I would also like to observe the below fact:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Proof-of-payment can be reconsidered, under payment point + scalar
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, to be &quot;pay-for-scalar&quot; scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also like to point out the below assumption, which underlies Bass
</I>&gt;<i> Amplifier (&quot;multipath payments&quot;, &quot;base AMP&quot;) and its claim to atomicity:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * If we agree that my secret `s` is worth `m` millisatoshi, then I (as a
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly rational economic agent) will not claim any payments conditional
</I>&gt;<i> on my revelation of `s` that sum up to less than `m` millisatoshi: I will
</I>&gt;<i> only claim *all* of them when I can get multiple payments conditional on my
</I>&gt;<i> revelation of `s` that sum up to `m` millisatoshi or more.
</I>&gt;<i>   * I now call this &quot;economically-rational atomicity&quot;, and describe also
</I>&gt;<i> them mildly here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../2018-March/001109.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-March/001109.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above is *exactly* the behavior we want E to perform: only if it
</I>&gt;<i> receives both requests to reveal its secret `e` behind `E`, will it
</I>&gt;<i> actually reveal the secret.
</I>&gt;<i> In our case, we turn the requests to E into partial payments of a single
</I>&gt;<i> invoice (though of course, the payment from S to E would be in the asset
</I>&gt;<i> that S wants rather than in Bitcoin).
</I>&gt;<i> E would not like to &quot;sell short&quot; its secret `e` for less than the price of
</I>&gt;<i> its service, thus if E is economically rational, it would only claim
</I>&gt;<i> payments (and reveal `e`) once *all* incoming payments sum up to the price
</I>&gt;<i> of its service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, the existing High AMP scheme would be reused to implement
</I>&gt;<i> the escrow E, and all that would be needed would be some way to request
</I>&gt;<i> invoices from E!
</I>&gt;<i> No additional code on top of High AMP is needed (very important, being a
</I>&gt;<i> lazy developer is hard work).
</I>&gt;<i> This should help make setting up new Es to be very simple, improving
</I>&gt;<i> competition in this space and helping further ensure economically-rational
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we squint, we can even say that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * This is actually a payment from B to E.
</I>&gt;<i> * The payment is split into two paths, B-&gt;X-&gt;E and B-&gt;X-&gt;S-&gt;E.
</I>&gt;<i> * X and S are just being paid surprisingly high fees, and are not in fact
</I>&gt;<i> being paid premiums or payment-for-product/service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, any argument that we could make, about the safety of Bass Amplifier,
</I>&gt;<i> would also serve as an argument we could make about E behaving as we would
</I>&gt;<i> like it to behave!
</I>&gt;<i> This should greatly reduce the tr\*st requirement from B and X to E: they
</I>&gt;<i> only need to trust that E operates econmically-rationally, and not trust
</I>&gt;<i> that E will, from the goodness of its own heart, operate correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A remaining issue for the above scheme is that B learns `s + e` and `x +
</I>&gt;<i> e`, not either `s` or `x`, and thus does not actually get full
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-payment.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, this lets us extend this scheme to more than just two
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneous transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> If for example we need to set up 5 simultaneous transactions, and E
</I>&gt;<i> charges 1000 millisatoshi for its service, then we just have each receiver
</I>&gt;<i> forward 200 millisatoshi each to E once their incoming payment has been set
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, the above problem, where B learns `s + e` and `x + e` but not
</I>&gt;<i> either `s` or `x`, could be solved by splitting the payment to E three
</I>&gt;<i> ways, with a third split from B to E, so that B learns `e` and can solve
</I>&gt;<i> `(s + e) - e` == `s` and `(x + e) - e` == `x` to get proof-of-payment for
</I>&gt;<i> both the actual purchase, and the premium charged by the exchange.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all of these, E remains unaware of the exact details of the
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement, it only cares that it is paid, with the use of High AMP being
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;coordination
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus this scheme is surprisingly flexible, and may solve more problems
</I>&gt;<i> than you might think.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for this insight, Nadav!
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
