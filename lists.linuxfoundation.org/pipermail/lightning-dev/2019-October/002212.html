Just throwing my two cents in here - as others have noted, OP_CAT
lets you create Merkle trees (allowing e.g. log-sized accountable
threshold sigs, at least in a post-Schnorr future).

It also allows manipulating signatures - e.g. forcing the revelation
of discrete logs by requiring the user use the (1/2) point as a nonce
(this starts with 11 zero bytes, which no other computationally
accessible point does), or by requiring two sigs with the same nonce.

It also lets you do proof-of-work-like computations on hashes or
curvepoints; or enforce that EC points come from a hash and have
no known discrete log. You can also switch on hashes, something
currently impossible because of the 4-byte limitation on numeric
opcodes. I don't have specific application of these in mind but
definitely have cut off many lines of inquiry because they were
impossible.

You could build a crappy Lamport signature, though the key would
be so big that you'd never do this pre-MAST :P.
