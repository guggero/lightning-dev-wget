Ok, so this is always possible because the commitment transaction is
signaling opt-in rbf and therefore any child txes are too? From bip125:
&quot;Transactions that don't explicitly signal replaceability are replaceable
under this policy for as long as any one of their ancestors signals
replaceability and remains unconfirmed.&quot; But yes, it can get unnecessarily
expensive to replace everything that the attacker added.


&gt;<i> Why not stick with the original design from Adelaide with a spending path
</I>&gt;<i> with a 1CSV that is anyone can spend (or that is revealed by spending
</I>&gt;<i> another output).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 What script would this be exactly? While still unconfirmed, the anchor
needs to be protected from being spent by anyone for the carve-out to work.
This also means that anyone spending after the csv needs to know that
script too. But how can they know if there is something like a pubkey (that
protected it during the unconfirmed phase) in it?
