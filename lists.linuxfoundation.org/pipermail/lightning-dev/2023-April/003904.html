<PRE>Hi Dustin,

I believe this is the scenario I described in [1]?

I haven't looked at the `announcement_signatures` case yet, but at least
for the `commit_sig` case this should never be an issue. It only means
that sometimes, after sending `splice_locked`, you will receive some
`commit_sig` messages that are for commitments that you don't care about
anymore. You should be able to safely ignore those `commit_sig`. I have
provided more details in the gist linked.

Let me know if I'm missing something, but I believe this is simply an
edge case that implementations need to correctly handle, not a protocol
issue? Or maybe I'm not understanding the scenario correctly?

By the way, I find your notation a bit hard to follow...I think that we
really need to detail the exact message flow (like I did in the linked
gist) to be able to explain protocol issues, otherwise there's always
a risk that people think about a slightly different message flow, which
means we'll just talk past each other...

Cheers,
Bastien

Le jeu. 6 avr. 2023 &#224; 02:40, Dustin Dettmer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">dustin at koinkeep.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In testing the `splice_locked` workflow I discovered a race condition
</I>&gt;<i> which is critical we solve correctly. The core problem happens if any
</I>&gt;<i> channel activity occurs in the time after `splice_locked` is sent and
</I>&gt;<i> before `splice_locked` is received.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> `splice_locked` is defined as being locked once it is both sent and
</I>&gt;<i> received. It is fairly trivial to build a test case for this -- have a node
</I>&gt;<i> continually spamming payments while `splice_lock`ing is occurring and the
</I>&gt;<i> race condition will trigger relatively often.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The race condition effects two messages in particular: `commitment_signed`
</I>&gt;<i> and `announcement_signatures`. Below is an example of how it occurs with
</I>&gt;<i> commitment but the flow is essentially the same for announcement:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Legend:
</I>&gt;<i> Item -&gt; means sent
</I>&gt;<i> Item &lt;- means received
</I>&gt;<i> Chan X (implies a channel at block height X)
</I>&gt;<i> (Since these happen at different times)
</I>&gt;<i> Splice locked race condition example
</I>&gt;<i> Node A. Node B.
</I>&gt;<i> * Channel starts at block height 100
</I>&gt;<i> splice_locked -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;- splice_locked
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;- commitments_signed (Chan 100)
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; splice_locked
</I>&gt;<i> Node B now considers splice locked (Chan 106)
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;- commitments_signed (Chan 106)
</I>&gt;<i> splice_locked &lt;-
</I>&gt;<i> Node A now considers splice locked (Chan 106)
</I>&gt;<i> commitments_signed &lt;- (Chan 100)
</I>&gt;<i> commitments_signed &lt;- (Chan 106)
</I>&gt;<i> Node A considers the commitments_signed for Chan 100 invalid.
</I>&gt;<i> The commitments_signed for Chan 106 is, however, valid.
</I>&gt;<i> This example uses commitments_signed but remains a problem for any message
</I>&gt;<i> that depends on channel state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution requires the temporary storing of two items:
</I>&gt;<i> * [scid] last_short_channel_id (the pre-splice short channel id)
</I>&gt;<i> * [bool] splice_await_commitment_succcess
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After sending &amp; receiving `splice_locked` (so called 'mutual splice lock),
</I>&gt;<i> the last_short_channel_id should be set to the pre-splice short channel id
</I>&gt;<i> and splice_await_commitment_succcess should be flagged to true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If an `announcement_signatures` is received with an scid matching
</I>&gt;<i> `last_short_channel_id` the message should be ignored and the channel
</I>&gt;<i> connection should not be aborted (as it normally would).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a `commitment_signed` message is received with the
</I>&gt;<i> tlv splice_info-&gt;splice_channel_id set to something other than the
</I>&gt;<i> successfully confirmed splice channel_id, the message should be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once a revoke_and_ack is successfully sent OR received,
</I>&gt;<i> `last_short_channel_id` and `splice_await_commitment_succcess` should be
</I>&gt;<i> reset and normal validation of `announcement_signatures` and
</I>&gt;<i> `commitment_signed` should be resumed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This solves the race condition while preserving as strict a validation of
</I>&gt;<i> messages as possible and removes the need to add new fields to these
</I>&gt;<i> messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Dusty
