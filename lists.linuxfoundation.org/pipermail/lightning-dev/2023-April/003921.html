<PRE>Hi Michael and Lisa,

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CLN as implemented is currently nicely decoupled from the block source; as
</I>&gt;<i> a project we assume that the node runner will choose a block backend that
</I>&gt;<i> fits their self-sovereignty goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This provides us with a nice separation of concerns. The block source is
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for ensuring that only consensus valid data is delivered to the
</I>&gt;<i> node, which in turn allows us to focus on processing and reacting to that
</I>&gt;<i> data, as necessary.
</I>
Let me just mention that [1] I have been working on a plugin 
that allows experimentation with different types of Bitcoin Core 
node alternatives (including core too), and it also supports BIP 157 
with nakamoto [2].

In the upcoming months, I plan to allocate some time to work 
directly on Nakamoto.

&gt;<i> There&#8217;s probably a real opportunity to &#8220;comingle&#8221; the peering of LN gossip
</I>&gt;<i> + block data networks, this has been suggested a few times but never
</I>&gt;<i> seriously pursued from the LN side. Having the peering functions of
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoin-core broken out into a more composable/reusable piece may be a good
</I>&gt;<i> first step here, and as a project would largely be on the bitcoin core
</I>&gt;<i> side. Maybe this work is already in progress? I havent been keeping up with
</I>&gt;<i> developments there.
</I>
A missing piece at the moment is a unified approach to fee calculation. 
This logic is critical for Lightning nodes, so if we don't have a uniform 
way of estimating fees, it could lead to several issues.

P.S: The fee estimation problem may have already been solved by Neutrino, 
but I'm not aware of it.
