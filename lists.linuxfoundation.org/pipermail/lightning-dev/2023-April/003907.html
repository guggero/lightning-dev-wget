&gt;&gt;<i> This is a clever constructions that lets you do a 2-party lightning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel with existing opcodes where cheating doesn't result in you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> losing all your funds (or, in fact, any of your in-channel funds).
</I>
&gt;<i> Ah, a significant difference between this and eltoo is in the game
</I>&gt;<i> theory of what happens if you lose access to the latest state.
</I>
&gt;<i> In eltoo, how things would work in that case, is that you would attempt
</I>&gt;<i> to close the channel to an old state that you do still remember (from a
</I>&gt;<i> backup), at which point either (a) your counterparty publishes a later
</I>&gt;<i> state, and you settle with that (possibly with you paying some modest
</I>&gt;<i> penalty if you're using a Daric-like protocol), or (b) your counterparty
</I>&gt;<i> does nothing, and you settle at the old state.
</I>
&gt;<i> With tunable penalties, you are in more of a quandry. If you broadcast
</I>&gt;<i> an old &quot;St&quot; transaction to attempt to close to an old state, then your
</I>&gt;<i> counterparty will simply claim those funds and penalise you; however
</I>&gt;<i> there is nothing forcing them to publish any newer state as well. At
</I>&gt;<i> that point your counterparty can hold your share of the channel funds
</I>&gt;<i> hostage indefinitely.
</I>
&gt;<i> Holding your funds hostage is probably an improvement on simply losing
</I>&gt;<i> them altogether, of course, so I think this is still a strict improvement
</I>&gt;<i> on ln-penalty (modulo additional complexity etc).
</I>
Yes, that's a good point.

I did describe an extension, called &quot;Unilateral Close after an Old Transaction is Put On-Chain&quot;, in the Tunable Penalties paper and in the Factory Optimized Channels paper.
The idea is to add a Trigger transaction that spends the output of the Funding transaction.
In response to seeing the Trigger transaction, the other party can put their final State transaction and (after a to-self-delay) Commitment transaction on-chain.
However, if the other party doesn't do so, then after a 3*to-self-delay, the party that forgot the state can initiate the Decker-Wattenhofer protocol to settle the channel.
Of course, the eltoo protocol could be used instead of the Decker-Wattenhofer protocol at this point if APO is available.

Regards,
John
