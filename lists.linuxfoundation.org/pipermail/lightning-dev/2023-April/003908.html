One thing that confuses me about the paper is how to think about routing
to a &quot;channel&quot; rather than a node -- ie the payment from &quot;E-&gt;FG-&gt;A&quot; where
&quot;FG&quot; isn't &quot;F&quot; or &quot;G&quot;, but &quot;both of them&quot;. It feels like there's a whole
mass of complications hidden in there from a routing perspective; like how
do you link &quot;FG&quot; back with &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, how do you decide fees, how do
you communicate fees/max_htlc/etc. I think it also implies that channel
capacity is no longer really something you can gossip very sensibly --
if you have a factory ((A,B),C,D,E) then every payment through AB to C
or D or E will decrease AB's channel capacity. You could still gossip the
capacity of the overall factory, and sum that to get an overall lightning
network capacity, of course. But a lot of the ways of simplifying it
also make it harder to do all the nice rebalancing.

Anyway, I've tried a few times now to put some thoughts together on that
and come up with nothing that I'm happy with, so figured it might be at
least worth posing explicitly as a problem...

Cheers,
aj
