<PRE>Hi Zeeman,

&gt;<i> i.e. I send my high-fee RBF-enabled channel funding to you, at the same
</I>time I send a conflicting low-fee RBF-disabled transaction (that pays the
entire channel amount to myself) to all the miners I can find.

Mapping miners mempools will be a cost in spying infrastructure and thus
make the malicious routing node job harder, providing a security
improvement for zero-conf channels. I used &quot;lower trust&quot; intentionally,
it's not binary (what about opening a channel with a reorg-powerful
counterparty ?).

&gt;<i> And your fullnode will not see the conflicting low-fee RBF-disabled tx
</I>either because it is lower fee than what you have in your mempool and you
will reject it.

I was assuming a no-mempool mobile LN client, thus not going to be blind by
your high-fee RBF. But still able to speak with the p2p network thus you
can actively seek that your transaction has been accepted by ~100 peers.

Overall, I don't think this scheme is worthy to work on unless double-spend
of zero-conf chans become a real issue, just to mention we have potential
solutions in this case.

&gt;<i> There Ain't No Such Thing As A Global Mempool!

I know :)

Le mar. 25 ao&#251;t 2020 &#224; 03:38, ZmnSCPxj &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">ZmnSCPxj at protonmail.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Good morning Antoine,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Roei,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You might have a mechanism to lower trust in zero-conf channel opener.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually the local party can be in charge of broadcasting the funding
</I>&gt;<i> transaction, thus ensuring it's well-propagated across network mempools and
</I>&gt;<i> then start to accept incoming payment on the zero-conf channel. Per BIP 125
</I>&gt;<i> rules, a malicious funder/opener would have to pay a higher fee to replace
</I>&gt;<i> the channel funding tx and thus double-spend the HTLC. A local party may
</I>&gt;<i> require a higher fee funding transaction than it is necessary wrt ongoing
</I>&gt;<i> congestion to increase level of protection. And I think it's okay on the
</I>&gt;<i> economic-side, you will amortize this fee premium on the channel lifecycle.
</I>&gt;<i> Until the transaction gets confirmed you might only accept HTLC under this
</I>&gt;<i> fee. So you have game-theory security for your zero-conf channels as it
</I>&gt;<i> would cost more in fees than a HTLC double-spend win for the malicious
</I>&gt;<i> opener, under the assumption of non-miner-collusion with the attacker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since RBF is opt-in for Bitcoin Core nodes, and I believe most miners are
</I>&gt;<i> running Bitcoin Core, it is trivial to double-broadcast.
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. I send my high-fee RBF-enabled channel funding to you, at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time I send a conflicting low-fee RBF-disabled transaction (that pays the
</I>&gt;<i> entire channel amount to myself) to all the miners I can find.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the miners received an RBF-disabled tx, they will not evict it even
</I>&gt;<i> if they see a higher-fee RBF-enabled tx.
</I>&gt;<i> And your fullnode will not see the conflicting low-fee RBF-disabled tx
</I>&gt;<i> either because it is lower fee than what you have in your mempool and you
</I>&gt;<i> will reject it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You really have to trust that I do not do this when I offer a channel to
</I>&gt;<i> you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There Ain't No Such Thing As A Global Mempool!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
