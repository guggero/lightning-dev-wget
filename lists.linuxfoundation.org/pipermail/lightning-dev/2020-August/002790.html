<PRE>Hi all,

# Simulating Eltoo / ANYPREVOUT Factories Using SCU Escrows

In this write-up I hope to convince you that it is possible to create some
weak version of Eltoo channels and channel factories today without
SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT (although the version using this sighash is clearly
superior) using ZmnSCPxj's proposal Smart Contracts Unchained (SCU) which
Ben Carman has cleverly given the name SCUE'd Eltoo.

## Introduction

### Eltoo / ANYPREVOUT

Eltoo is a proposal for a new (and generally improved) way of doing
Lightning channels which also allows for multi-party channels (and channel
factories). I am by no means fluent in the going's on of eltoo and
anyprevout so I will link <A HREF="https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf">https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf</A> and
<A HREF="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sighash_noinput/.">https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sighash_noinput/.</A> My understanding is that
at a high level, rather than using a penalty mechanism to update channel
states, sighash_anyprevout is used to make any old commitment transaction
spendable by any newer commitment transaction so that old revoked states
can be updated on-chain instead of relying on a punishment mechanism.
Benefits of this scheme include but are not limited to easier watchtower
implementations, static partial backups, and multi-party channels.

### Smart Contracts Unchained (SCU)

I strongly recommend the reader read this write up by ZmnSCPxj before
continuing <A HREF="https://zmnscpxj.github.io/bitcoin/unchained.html">https://zmnscpxj.github.io/bitcoin/unchained.html</A>

At a high level the idea is to use a participant-chosen &quot;federation&quot; of
&quot;escrows&quot; which can be thought of as virtual machines which understand
contracts written in some language and which enforce said contracts by
giving users signatures of transactions that are produced by these
contracts. A general goal of SCU is to be trust-minimizing and as private
as possible. For example, escrows should not be able to see that they are
being used if there are no disputes, among other considerations that can be
made to make SCU Escrows as oblivious as possible (discussed further below).

## Proposal (Un-Optimized)

At a high level, this proposal is to replace the use of ANYPREVOUT with a
federation of SCU Escrows which will enforce state updates by only
generating signatures to spend older states with newer ones.

I will work in the general context of multi-party channels but all of this
works just as well in two-party (Lightning) channels.

Say that we have N parties who wish to enter into a multi-party channel
(aka channel factory). Each participant has a public key P_i and together
they do a distributed key generation (DKG) of some kind to reach some
shared secret x (for example, each party contributes a commitment to a
random number and then that random number, MuSig style, and the sum of
these random numbers constitutes the shared secret). This x will be used to
derive a sequence of (shared) key pairs (x_k, X_k) (for example this can be
done by having x_k = PRNG(x, k)).

Let State(k) be some agreed upon commitment of the channel state at update
k (for example, HMAC(k, kth State Tx outputs)). State(0) is a commitment to
0 and the initial channel balances.

Let Delta be some CSV timelock.

For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the case where only a single
SCU escrow is used which has public key E, but note that all of the
following can be extended to a threshold scheme of escrows. E_k will be
used to denote some tweak of E by State(k) similar to the tweak described
in SCU.

### Transactions

#### Funding Transaction

Like all such schemes, the funding transaction is some transaction
containing an N-of-N multi-signature output with keys P_1, ..., P_N called
the funding output.

#### Commitment Transaction

The commitment transaction spends the funding output and has a single
output which has two spending conditions: Either E_k and X_k sign OR all N
parties sign cooperatively after Delta.

#### State Transaction

The state transaction spends the commitment transaction via the cooperative
branch and has (potentially many) outputs representing the current channel
state. For example there will be an output for each solvent participant in
this channel, as well as an output for ever contract living on this channel
(for instance, other smaller channels).

#### Commitment Update Transaction

Let k2 be some state where k2 &gt; k.

The commitment update transaction spends either a commitment transaction's
non-cooperative branch (E_k and X_k) or another commitment update
transaction's non-time-locked branch, and has a single output which has two
spending conditions: Either E_k2 and X_k2 sign OR E_k2' and X_k2' sign
after Delta where those are tweaked keys in some way (to avoid signatures
generated for one case being used in the other).

#### State Update Transaction

The state update transaction spends the commitment update transaction via
the time-locked branch and has outputs equal to those on the (k2)th state
transaction.

### Update Mechanism

The update mechanism here is the same as would be expected for a
multi-party payment channel but with the added step that all parties must
sign the commitment State(k) before they sign State Transaction k.

### Settlement

#### Cooperative (Normal Close)

As you might expect, cooperative closure is where a transaction is
cooperatively constructed which directly spends the on-chain funding UTXO
and outputs the current State Transaction's outputs.

#### Non-Cooperative (Force Close)

In any case where not all parties are able or willing to sign a cooperative
closing transaction, any party can broadcast the most recent commitment
transaction, which can then be spent by anyone broadcasting the most recent
state transaction after Delta.

If, at any time, any party broadcasts an old commitment transaction k &lt; c,
any other party has until Delta to correct this mistake/attack. They do so
by going to the SCU Escrow and presenting all signatures of State(k) and of
State(c) which the Escrow verifies as well as verifying that k &lt; c. Should
all of these things check out, the Escrow can construct a Commitment Update
Transaction (for (k, k2) = (k, c)) and the corresponding State Update
Transaction and sign both of these transactions using E. These signatures
(along with signatures from the shared keys X_k and X_c) can be used to
broadcast the commitment update transaction, and after Delta, the state
update transaction.

If a commitment update transaction is broadcast for an old state c &lt; c',
then any party has until Delta to correct this mistake/attack. They do so
by following the same exact steps as in the previous paragraph but with k
&lt;- c and c &lt;- c' and where the Commitment Update Transaction spends the
previous Commitment Update Transaction instead of a Commitment Transaction.

In this way any channel participant can unilaterally update the on-chain
commitment transaction until the most recent state is reached after which
Delta will pass and a State Update Transaction with the current state will
be valid to broadcast.

## Optimizations and Open Details

### Multiple Escrows

The above can be done with some user-chosen federation with some threshold
by replacing E above with a threshold condition using many escrow public
keys. Doing so with as large and diverse a federation as possible is
strongly encouraged as it reduces the likelihood that the federation will
be bribed to spend the non-time-locked branch of the commitment transaction
along with some channel participant directly. I believe it should
(hopefully) be possible to make such an attack traceable (i.e. provide
proof that this happened in an illegal way) so that attacked parties can
prove that Escrows have been malicious.

### Taproot

As is mentioned in SCU, the escrow scheme is made much better (especially
in the multi-escrow case) by Taproot and the above scheme using SCU is
improved even further as all outputs are bi-conditional and these two
conditions can be separated into different merkle branches to increase
privacy and fungibility.

### What is given to the Escrow? (aka Blinding / ZKP)

In the above proposal, virtually all information about the channel, as well
as how to find it on chain, is given to the escrow(s). This is really bad,
and luckily it is avoidable! In principal we want Escrows to do nothing but
(potentially many) random looking simple computations on random looking
inputs to generate random looking outputs. The algorithm given the the
Escrow is currently:

Inputs =

* output to spend (either a commitment output or a commitment update output)
* State(k) corresponding to that output
* signatures of State(k)
* State(c) with c &gt; k
* signatures of State(c)
* N public keys
* Relevant shared public keys
* Delta

Output = If any signature is invalid or c &lt;= k, FAIL. Otherwise, generate a
digital signature using E with some tweak (as a function of inputs) and of
some hash (as a function of inputs).

As such, I will first note that the verification part of this algorithm's
execution is linear time and so there must be a way to do it in Zero
Knowledge. Specifically I believe this should be &quot;as simple as&quot; blinding
all state inputs with random tweaks and blinding signatures of these states
in the corresponding way (this may require that the signatures given by all
parties during updates actually be altered in some way to make this work).
Furthermore I think it should be possible (at least in theory it seems
plausible to me) that all inputs can be hidden/blinded/tweaked and the
Escrow performs some computations on these random looking inputs resulting
in either a FAIL, or in further random looking computation using E (likely
requiring some ZKP inputs proving that the calling party has followed some
set of rules) to generate a blinded signature which can then be unblinded
by the caller to receive a valid digital signature usable to enforce the
above proposal.

Please note that I do not have these details worked out in any meaningful
way (and probably won't be able to do so, would love if someone more apt in
this area would give this some thought!), but also that while this vastly
improves the privacy and security of this scheme, it isn't strictly
speaking a necessary optimization if you are willing to place more trust
and be less private with Escrows.

### Fees

I have given no thought to transaction fees in the above and I'm sure there
are a bunch of ways to do them wrong but I'm hoping that it is possible to
add anchor outputs or whatever other alterations need to occur to allow fee
considerations to work out.

I hope people find this proposal interesting! In theory it could be
implemented on today's Bitcoin (though I will not have time to work on this
in the foreseeable future, but would be happy to help anyone who would want
to try to do this)!

Best,
Nadav
