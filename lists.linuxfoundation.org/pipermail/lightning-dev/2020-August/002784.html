<PRE>Hi Matt and thanks for your notes.

You are right.  They really should be broadcasted once after the
funding transaction is sufficiently deep. I confused
that with the exchange of channel_update privately between them before
the channel is confirmed so they both
will be able to relay payments using this channel.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may make sense to reuse some &quot;private short channel ID negotiation&quot; feature for the temporary 0-conf short channel id
</I>&gt;<i> value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing this protocol doesn't capture is unidirectional 0-conf - maybe the channel initiator is happy to receive
</I>&gt;<i> payments (since its their funds which opened the channel, this is reasonable), but the channel initie-ee (?) isn't
</I>&gt;<i> (which, again, is reasonable). This leaves only the push_msat value pay-able, and only once, but is a perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable trust model and I believe some wallets use this today.
</I>
Although this proposal addresses the bi-directional zero-conf channel
both parties are able to &quot;hold&quot; any payment.
When the payee decides not to release the preimage based on  some
policy (total funds at risk, wait for confirmation)
the channel becomes unidirectional.
Implementing a unidirectional channel this way also has some advantages such as:
1. It gives you the ability to increase trust on an existing zero-conf
channel. Sometimes this is preferable because
    it saves the need to open additional channels and it shortens the
trust period (waiting for confirmation for a
    previously opened channel).
2. The funds sent to the channel acceptor can be a result of a
lightning payment, including proof of payment for the
    payer.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to discuss the ability to skip a channel funding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction confirmation, making the channel fully operational before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its on-chain confirmation (aka a zero-conf channel).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Till confirmation, this channel requires trust between its two parties
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and in the case of a remote initiator, it puts the received funds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the local party at risk.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless, there are cases where it makes sense to support this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior. For example, in cases both parties decide to trust each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other. Or, in cases where trust between the parties already exists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (buying a pre-loaded channel from a service like Bitrefill).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The motivation is gained from the &quot;Immediate on-boarding&quot; use case:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Bob is connected to a routing node and issues an invoice with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     routing hint that points to a fake channel between Bob and that node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * When Alice pays Bob's invoice, the routing node intercepts the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     and holds it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Then, the routing node does the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Opens a channel to Bob where Bob has a choice of skipping funding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       confirmation (channel is open and active).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Pays Bob the original Alices' invoice (potentially, minus a service fee)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  From Bob perspective it is his choice on whether to agree for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payment via this channel (and by that increase the trust) or disagree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and wait for confirmation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another practical way for Bob is to skip confirmation and &quot;hold&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payment by not providing the pre-image.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now different implementations support zero-conf channels in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different ways. These implementations have defined their own way on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how to agree on a short_channel_id (fake one) before the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is confirmed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The following suggests some changes to the funding flow to support that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    1. accept_channel message - in case the fundee wants to skip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        confirmation he sends minimum_depth=0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    2. funding_signed message - no change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    3. funding_locked message - if fundee has sent minimum_depth=0, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        both parties send funding_locked while the channel_id is derived using a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        convention agreed on both. One proposal for such convention is to take it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        from the temporary_channel_id provided in previous open_channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        message as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          * Use the first 8 bytes to initialize an unsigned integer,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             call it shortID
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          * Apply this transformation:  shortID / 2^6 + 100,000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          * The above transformation ensures the block height falls in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             range of 100,000 - 2^18+100,000. The rationale is that the id will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             never point to a valid mined transaction and the first 100,000 blocks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             are left for testing in other chains.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          * Assuming the temporary_channel_id is some random number, it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            not likely that the derived short_channel_id will conflict with other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            channels in both peers but both peers should validate that before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            sending funding_locked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    4. When the channel is confirmed gossip messages such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        channel_update are re-broadcasted and refers to the confirmed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        channel_id (such as the case with re-org).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I created a PR in LND that implements these changes
