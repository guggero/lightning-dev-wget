<PRE>A few notes.

Given gossip messages will be rejected by many nodes if no such on-chain transaction exists, I don't think you can 
&quot;re-broadcast&quot; gossip messages at that time, instead I believe you simply need to not gossip until the funding 
transaction has some confirmations. Still, this shouldn't prevent receiving payments, as invoices carrying a last-hop 
hint should be able to indicate any short_channel_id value and have it be accepted.

It may make sense to reuse some &quot;private short channel ID negotiation&quot; feature for the temporary 0-conf short channel id 
value.

One thing this protocol doesn't capture is unidirectional 0-conf - maybe the channel initiator is happy to receive 
payments (since its their funds which opened the channel, this is reasonable), but the channel initie-ee (?) isn't 
(which, again, is reasonable). This leaves only the push_msat value pay-able, and only once, but is a perfectly 
reasonable trust model and I believe some wallets use this today.

</I>&gt;<i> I would like to discuss the ability to skip a channel funding
</I>&gt;<i> transaction confirmation, making the channel fully operational before
</I>&gt;<i> its on-chain confirmation (aka a zero-conf channel).
</I>&gt;<i> Till confirmation, this channel requires trust between its two parties
</I>&gt;<i> and in the case of a remote initiator, it puts the received funds of
</I>&gt;<i> the local party at risk.
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, there are cases where it makes sense to support this
</I>&gt;<i> behavior. For example, in cases both parties decide to trust each
</I>&gt;<i> other. Or, in cases where trust between the parties already exists
</I>&gt;<i> (buying a pre-loaded channel from a service like Bitrefill).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The motivation is gained from the &quot;Immediate on-boarding&quot; use case:
</I>&gt;<i> * Bob is connected to a routing node and issues an invoice with a
</I>&gt;<i>     routing hint that points to a fake channel between Bob and that node.
</I>&gt;<i> * When Alice pays Bob's invoice, the routing node intercepts the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i>     and holds it.
</I>&gt;<i> * Then, the routing node does the following:
</I>&gt;<i>    * Opens a channel to Bob where Bob has a choice of skipping funding
</I>&gt;<i>       confirmation (channel is open and active).
</I>&gt;<i>    * Pays Bob the original Alices' invoice (potentially, minus a service fee)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From Bob perspective it is his choice on whether to agree for the
</I>&gt;<i> payment via this channel (and by that increase the trust) or disagree
</I>&gt;<i> and wait for confirmation.
</I>&gt;<i> Another practical way for Bob is to skip confirmation and &quot;hold&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> payment by not providing the pre-image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now different implementations support zero-conf channels in
</I>&gt;<i> different ways. These implementations have defined their own way on
</I>&gt;<i> how to agree on a short_channel_id (fake one) before the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> is confirmed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The following suggests some changes to the funding flow to support that:
</I>&gt;<i>    1. accept_channel message - in case the fundee wants to skip
</I>&gt;<i>        confirmation he sends minimum_depth=0
</I>&gt;<i>    2. funding_signed message - no change.
</I>&gt;<i>    3. funding_locked message - if fundee has sent minimum_depth=0, then
</I>&gt;<i>        both parties send funding_locked while the channel_id is derived using a
</I>&gt;<i>        convention agreed on both. One proposal for such convention is to take it
</I>&gt;<i>        from the temporary_channel_id provided in previous open_channel
</I>&gt;<i>        message as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>          * Use the first 8 bytes to initialize an unsigned integer,
</I>&gt;<i>             call it shortID
</I>&gt;<i>          * Apply this transformation:  shortID / 2^6 + 100,000
</I>&gt;<i>          * The above transformation ensures the block height falls in the
</I>&gt;<i>             range of 100,000 - 2^18+100,000. The rationale is that the id will
</I>&gt;<i>             never point to a valid mined transaction and the first 100,000 blocks
</I>&gt;<i>             are left for testing in other chains.
</I>&gt;<i>          * Assuming the temporary_channel_id is some random number, it is
</I>&gt;<i>            not likely that the derived short_channel_id will conflict with other
</I>&gt;<i>            channels in both peers but both peers should validate that before
</I>&gt;<i>            sending funding_locked.
</I>&gt;<i>    4. When the channel is confirmed gossip messages such as
</I>&gt;<i>        channel_update are re-broadcasted and refers to the confirmed
</I>&gt;<i>        channel_id (such as the case with re-org).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I created a PR in LND that implements these changes
