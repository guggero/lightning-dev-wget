<PRE>Just a quick update on my side: I have updated the spec as discussed during
the milan meetup and dropped the end-to-end payload, since we don't have
any good usecase for it currently.

I kept the shared secret backlog for now, since committing the routing
information to the payment hash is awkward: either we include the payment
hash in each per-hop payload, making it possible to stop a replay
immediately, or we add it to the last per-hop payload, at which point only
the last hop would be able to identify a replay attack, making it possible
to replay and observe traffic patterns. In both cases we'd be increasing
the per-hop payload size, which is pretty expensive to do.

Both the C-lightning implementation and the lnd implementations have been
adapted and can be used.

Cheers,
Christian

So we'd still be using ECDSA for everything that could go to the
bitcoin blockchain, and use Schnorr for all other crypto
primitives. Sounds good to me, if we can be certain that reuse across
different schemes does not open us to new threats.

</I>
I'd argue that rotating the onion key is already valuable in order to
limit the shared secret backlog, allowing us to forget them after a
rotation, even if we don't have forward secrecy. If we can get forward
secrecy as well all the better though :-)

Cheers,
Christian
