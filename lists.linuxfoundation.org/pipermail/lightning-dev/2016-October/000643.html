If at all possible I'd like to enable even mobile users to open
multiple channels and increase the connectivity in the network. I
think users are likely to want to open multiple channels, to earn some
fees, offsetting their own payments, or just to support the
network. And on the other side, I don't think they'd be too upset if
wallets went ahead and just created a number of channels by default.

&gt;<i> - Typical usage scenario on phones and tablets will be &quot;open an app&quot; - &quot;conduct a micropayment&quot; - &quot;send an app to background to be automatically shut down by OS in a few minutes&quot;. So it's safe to say that majority of LN nodes on such devices will be offline 99% of time and as such won't be of much use in relaying payments. Also often it might not be in user's interest if a portion of funds suddenly becomes locked in HTLC (especially if the lock lasts for hours).
</I>
Running a lightning daemon should be relatively lightweight, so I
think it would be reasonable for people to have a wallet running, even
only when the phone is plugged in. Even having the app run only a few
minutes like you said, it can be used to forward a decent amount of
transfers over channels that are already established. The locking up
of funds is indeed problematic, but we can limit the maximum amount
that can be locked in at any point in time, and would only impact if
the user is attempting to make a transfer that is larger than the
reserve.

&gt;<i> - One channel with 1 BTC is better than two 0.5 BTC channels for an end user in a way that he can receive and send larger amounts: two 0.5 BTC channels will never let me receive 0.51 BTC (AFAIK combining multiple channel capacities for a single transaction is possible in theory but won't be implemented in initial LN release).
</I>
I'd argue the opposite: two channels with 50% each are better, since
the user is not relying on a single peer being available when she
intends to make a payment. Opening a single channel is a classical
single point of failure, a costly one too, since you'd have to tear
down the channel, and create a new one.

Combining multiple channels is trivial, and only the two endpoints
need to know how to do it. The sender simply generates multiple
routes, avoiding exhausted channels, and the recipient has to know
that he should wait for the entirety of the funds to be secure before
triggering the clearing. So even if the 1.0 protocol does not support
it, we can add signaling between the endpoints.

&gt;<i> - Last but not least, having a single payment channel improves UX and simplifies UI and thus lowers the barrier for adoption. Also it is my understanding that mobile users won't care much about relaying payments (and for those of them who will using a phone for this purpose is a bad idea anyway).
</I>
I don't see a direct connection between UX and the fact that there are
multiple channels, just like Bitcoin wallets don't just chose a single
TCP connection. The underlying connections do not actually have to
show up in the UX interface at all, especially if we allow for
multi-path routes as above.

It's true that users won't care too much about relaying other people's
transactions, but if the message is that they can offset their own
fees or earn something by being a nice neighbor, I think people will
want to do that :-)

&gt;<i> My current plan as I continue working on an Android LN wallet is to design UI and UX in a way that only supports a single payment channel but it's quite possible I've missed something important here so once again I'd like to hear if you think this is a viable approach.
</I>
I am speculating on what users might want, and I might very well be
wrong. So if you find it easier to build the app assuming a single
channel, then that's perfectly fine. But maybe it is possible not to
bind the single channel and the UX too tightly :-)
