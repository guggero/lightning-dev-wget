</I>
If y'all recall, the initial version of the Sphinx derived onion format
included an end-to-end payload. In the first revision, removed this
payload as at the time it was very large (1KB iirc), an at the time, we
didn't see nay clear use case for such a payload (and also due to MTU
constraints?). In my opinion, we should re-introduce this payload so we
aren't put into a corner where we need to shave bytes off of the per-hop
payload in order to accommodate application level schemes/apps.

Re-introducing the e2e payload would allow us to define a strict
separation of layers: h2h payload is reserved for _forwarding_ critical
information, while the e2e payload is reserved for _applications_ to place
relevant data which is also onion encrypted + authenticated. IMO, the e2e
payload doesn't need to be any where as large at it was previously (which
doubled the size of the onion packet). I'd proposed re-introducing it with
a size of somewhere around 200 bytes. With this, I could send you
something to tweet once the payment has been extended :p.

</I>
Agreed that that would make for a really useful tag. I had a user which
was making a store on lnd request such a feature as his use-case depended
on users only having a particular time window to make the payment. This
could of course be enforced server side, but allow senders to enforce it
at the origin of the payment saves them from extending an HTLC all
together. Also in the world of pre-paying for HTLC's, you'd only want to
extend an HTLC is you had a high degree of certainty that it'll be
claimed, otherwise you've just wasted your precious mSAT :(.

&gt;<i> Note: we will lose this ability when we switch to Schnorr, apparently.
</I>
AFAIK, this isn't the case. With Schnorr signatures (that include the
entire point, instead of the hash), we actually won't need to include a
recovery ID at all.

</I>
Let's do it (BOLT 11)! As were all getting pretty close to the stage of
cross-implementation interoperability tests, having a shared payment
request format will be super useful.

Perfect, even through your price is already outdated, and it currently is
$2200/BTC :p.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complains).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I considered using the m/u/n modifier as the decimal point, eg:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oops, I think I did what Luke hates, and sort of self assigned a

</I>&gt;<i> Huh?  I just did exactly the same thing!  So I'll take BOLT 11.
