Unfortunately people want this for mid-points, too, to do weird crazy
shit.  But it's trivial for us to extend to a &quot;multi-cell&quot; format in
future, so I'm tempted by the default of &quot;no change&quot;?

Agreed.  Latest version has a UTC timestamp, and expiry time (defaults
to 1 hour if not specified).  As you say, must be server-enforced too,
but it's nice to make it clear to the user (and it's signed in case of
dispute).

</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK, this isn't the case. With Schnorr signatures (that include the

</I>
Quoting a private conversation with Pieter Wuille, when I asked him
about it:

        You can't.

        At least, if you follow modern practices (which make the signature hash
        commit to the public key), you can't do pubkey recovery.

        It *is* possible (and safe, I think) to commit to the pubkeyhash
        rather than the pubkey directly, in which case you can verify a
        (signature, pubkeyhash, msg) triplet.

        I think you can use a 128-bit pubkey hash, actually.

</I>
OK, I'll start typing...

Thanks!
Rusty.
