<PRE>I mentioned some things off-list before but let me add them here for completeness.

My biggest concern was the use of `short_channel_id` as an alias for
the endpoint, it just felt wrong having to perform that lookup to get
a space saving. This is all the more strange since the remainder of
the spec is very generous with space, allowing arbitrary (up to 1024
byte) string descriptions and similar. So good job at removing it,
even if it was only as a fallback or hint.

I also don't like the amount shorthands (k/m/g/...), that's purely a
UI/UX concern and since these invoices are not user-readable I don't
see the point. Even if they were user-readable, we'd be forcing people
to do the conversion BTC -&gt; SAT on their own, since we would not
support amount in bitcoin units (BTC, mBTC, ...). I'd say either get
rid of the shorthands or add the BTC shorthands as well.

Other than that, I really like the proposal, it's clean and
extensible, and it supports testnet ;-) I also like using bech32 as a
serialization format, if people also support the DNS bootstrapping and
node lookup they can simply reuse that dependency, and it is a bit
shorter than hex. We might consider also supporting a different, human
readable, encoding though (without changing the signature
serialization). And finally we could directly derive a URI scheme from
the bech32 encoded string by replacing the '1' with a ':', but we can
spin that discussion off in another thread ^^

Cheers,
Christian
