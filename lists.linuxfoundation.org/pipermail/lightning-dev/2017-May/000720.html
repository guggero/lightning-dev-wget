Hmm, good point.  I was wrong about stealing 2 bytes from
outgoing_cltv_value, BTW: it needs to be a block height :(

&gt;&gt;<i> 1. LD provides a payment hash as usual.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. You pick a payment preimage for your winnings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Construct route through the two LD nodes and back to you, except
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    1. the payment hash is encoded into the two padding fields for the LD nodes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    2. the onion switches to commit to your own payment hash for the return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then if you lose (using your payment hash XOR preimage), LD takes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money and you can see you lost by receiving the preimage.  If you win,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it simply continues forwarding the onion with the new payment hash and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (increased) amount.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The cool thing about this is that you can pay someone probabalistically

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hashes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah I see, I had a bit of trouble seeing how we could create a route
</I>&gt;<i> that commits to the 2 possible outcomes, since the HMAC commits to the
</I>&gt;<i> `amt_to_forward`, so there'd be no way of forwarding either wins or
</I>&gt;<i> losses. You're saying that the route simply stops at LD if we lose.
</I>
Yes.  LD knows the preimage, so can take the funds (if it wins).  The
rest of the onion commits to the *new* rhash and amount, so if it loses
LD launches a new HTLC using the rest of the onion.

&gt;<i> The XORing is quite interesting though I can't really see how it'd
</I>&gt;<i> work yet. LD would commit to a secret by sending you the hash, you
</I>&gt;<i> construct a route using that hash and your own pick (payment hash for
</I>&gt;<i> the second half) on the first half and then send the winnings back to
</I>&gt;<i> me using my own pick? How are you combining the LD hash and your own
</I>&gt;<i> hash to make it provably fair and giving LD the ability to pull the
</I>&gt;<i> payment in say 50% of the cases?
</I>
Well, you can tell if it cheats, since it provides the preimage, you
know you should have won.  You can't prove it to a third party, however.

XOR rules might look like:

        bottom 7 bits = 0000000 -&gt; LD wins (house edge)
        otherwise bottom bit = 1 : LD wins
        otherwise bottom bit = 0 : player wins

Cheers,
Rusty.
