<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> On the topic of signatures: as is proposed now, a user isn't able to verify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the validity of the signature (and thereby authenticity of the payreq and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrity of the contents) without first having a (direction || chanID) -&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pubKey mapping. In my opinion, the payreqs are already so long that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimizing for size is a bit of a waste. By replacing the chanID with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compressed serialized public key, users will be able to immediately verify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the signature without the use of an external mapping.
</I>
As much as I pushed for using the short chanID in the onion, I too am
a reluctant to use
it here. In addition to laolu's arguments, I would say:
- making the assumption that the network is well-known doesn't take
into account the fact
that announcements take time to propagate through the network
(typically a few minutes with
staggered broadcast every minute); ok it doesn't change often, but now
we will need to worry
about not using our most recently created/closed channels as reference.
- we already know that we won't always be able to have a full view of
the network in
the future, so I feel like we should rely on it as less as possible
- since payment requests are sent out-of-band, optimizing their size
is maybe not as
important as messages exchanged on the p2p network?

&gt;<i>As you pointed out offline, we can do key recovery from the signature[1],
</I>&gt;<i>so the information is there already in fact :)  The chanid is really a
</I>&gt;<i>courtesy, from this POV.
</I>
That is really amazing! Why not completely ditch the chanid then? ;-)

Cheers,

Pierre

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking of proposing something similar recently, but looks like you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beat me to it!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I really like the flexibility of the tag format. Over the past few months, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought of quite a bit of things application developers can do by utilizing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a tag-based payment request format in conjunction with either: the spare
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bytes of the onion payload or an abuse of the encrypted back errors (in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combo with some onion payload bytes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I thought about this too, but I'm reluctant to assign those onion
</I>&gt;<i> bytes as they're a limited resource.  Easy to add later, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the topic of bech32: I'm all for piggybacking on existing emerging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standards in the space, but I'm not convinced we really gain anything by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using it outside of the initial prefix. The human-readable amount within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prefix is nice for UX as you can eyeball exactly how much one is about to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pay/receive. However, these payment requests can get rather long, so I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> envision any user typing them out by hand or reading them to someone over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the phone.  As a result, I don't think we have much use for bech32 character
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which has been optimized for manual-entry.  Additionally, as this proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> includes a signature that covers the entire payreq, what's the use of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> added checksum? Detecting 3 characters out of 1024+ is rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insignificant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I kind of agree, but I think the code reuse outweighs other arguments,
</I>&gt;<i> since codebases are going to have bech32 anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The minimal theoretical size we can do is 20 (payment hash160) + 64
</I>&gt;<i> (signature).  We'd have to change the protocol to use hash160 instead of
</I>&gt;<i> sha256 (we already do this onchain).  But even that is 135 characters,
</I>&gt;<i> which is not going to be entered by hand, so I don't think it's worth
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the topic of signatures: as is proposed now, a user isn't able to verify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the validity of the signature (and thereby authenticity of the payreq and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrity of the contents) without first having a (direction || chanID) -&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pubKey mapping. In my opinion, the payreqs are already so long that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimizing for size is a bit of a waste. By replacing the chanID with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compressed serialized public key, users will be able to immediately verify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the signature without the use of an external mapping.

</I>&gt;<i> As you pointed out offline, we can do key recovery from the signature[1],
</I>&gt;<i> so the information is there already in fact :)  The chanid is really a
</I>&gt;<i> courtesy, from this POV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is a good step in the right direction. However, it utilizes an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encoding whose rationale make sense for the Bitcoin address use-case, but in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my opinion, doesn't carry over those compelling traits to the LN payreq
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use-case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty.
</I>&gt;<i> [1]  You also pointed out that we can use the same technique to remove
</I>&gt;<i>      node-id and bitcoin-key from the channel announcement.  Which would
</I>&gt;<i>      be awesome magic...
