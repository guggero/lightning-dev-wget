<PRE>Hi Rusty,

I was thinking of proposing something similar recently, but looks like you
beat me to it!

I really like the flexibility of the tag format. Over the past few months, I
thought of quite a bit of things application developers can do by utilizing
a tag-based payment request format in conjunction with either: the spare
bytes of the onion payload or an abuse of the encrypted back errors (in
combo with some onion payload bytes).

On the topic of bech32: I'm all for piggybacking on existing emerging
standards in the space, but I'm not convinced we really gain anything by
using it outside of the initial prefix. The human-readable amount within the
prefix is nice for UX as you can eyeball exactly how much one is about to
pay/receive. However, these payment requests can get rather long, so I don't
envision any user typing them out by hand or reading them to someone over
the phone.  As a result, I don't think we have much use for bech32 character
which has been optimized for manual-entry.  Additionally, as this proposal
includes a signature that covers the entire payreq, what's the use of the
added checksum? Detecting 3 characters out of 1024+ is rather
insignificant.

On the topic of signatures: as is proposed now, a user isn't able to verify
the validity of the signature (and thereby authenticity of the payreq and
integrity of the contents) without first having a (direction || chanID) -&gt;
pubKey mapping. In my opinion, the payreqs are already so long that
optimizing for size is a bit of a waste. By replacing the chanID with the
compressed serialized public key, users will be able to immediately verify
the signature without the use of an external mapping.

I think this is a good step in the right direction. However, it utilizes an
encoding whose rationale make sense for the Bitcoin address use-case, but in
my opinion, doesn't carry over those compelling traits to the LN payreq
use-case.
