Yes, there is a possibility for doing atomic cross chain swaps using
Lightning nodes, and routing in a circle back to ourself, starting
with the outgoing currency and ending in the desired currency. The
fact that we can directly perform the first hop on-chain, as you
pointed out, is a great way of having other nodes connect to us and
doing an initial balancing of the capacity, e.g., initially they'd own
100% of the channel, but with the conditional on-chain transfer they'd
send us some.

&gt;<i> Now, we can argue that we can add an &quot;invitation to connect to me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to make a channel that is set up to send money to me. This helps
</I>&gt;<i> also the new-business-node case (where Alice is setting up a
</I>&gt;<i> business and wants to initiate receive channels, rather than the
</I>&gt;<i> default send channels).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But what is the reason why channel opens, in current 1.0 spec,
</I>&gt;<i> require the initiator to be the one, and the only one, to put up
</I>&gt;<i> funding for the channel?
</I>
It's just simpler, since it requires very little coordination, having
multi-party funded channels is definitely on the roadmap, but with
your insight above we can already balance the channels right from the
get go.

&gt;<i> My understanding (it's not explicitly stated in the paper, or in the
</I>&gt;<i> rfc specs I've read) is that the initiator pays for the fees in
</I>&gt;<i> setting up the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we have an &quot;invitation to connect to me&quot; request, and people
</I>&gt;<i> comply with the request, the fees come from their funding of the
</I>&gt;<i> channels. If I spam the network with this request, then I will waste
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's time making those channels, locking up their funds, and
</I>&gt;<i> wasting their transaction fees. If I then don't open up a channel to
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else and I don't do some service for which I get paid, then
</I>&gt;<i> the channels set up to me are wasted in routing gossip, since no
</I>&gt;<i> route can pass through me, as there is no way to move money out of
</I>&gt;<i> my node.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, we can keep the &quot;initiator pays for full funding of channel
</I>&gt;<i> open&quot; and not have an &quot;invitation to connect to me&quot; request. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> can initiate a channel with a well-connected counterparty (paid for
</I>&gt;<i> by me), request a route through the new channel, to my counterparty,
</I>&gt;<i> and ending with an on-chain hop back to an address I control. This
</I>&gt;<i> effectively reverses the direction of the channel, and because I
</I>&gt;<i> have money in the channel, my counterparty can add the tx fees for
</I>&gt;<i> the on-chain hop to the routing fees he would charge for this onion
</I>&gt;<i> route, paid for from my initially sending-direction channel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think, basically, that allowing onion routes to start and end
</I>&gt;<i> on-chain is an elegant way to modify channel states to what we want,
</I>&gt;<i> while ensuring that everyone is reasonably protected from bad actors
</I>&gt;<i> on the LN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there is some risk. If I make a request to make a route
</I>&gt;<i> to a node, and have that route end up to, say,1.0 BTC to an on-chain
</I>&gt;<i> public key I control, and that node accepts, I know that node has at
</I>&gt;<i> least 1.0 BTC in spare funds, and I might use this information to
</I>&gt;<i> assess if I want to hack that node's operator's computer.
</I>
Well, at the latest when the channel is being funded you'd see that
information anyway. Also he could fund only part of the amount you
provided and instead give you a partial refund if it can't afford to
open a channel with the capacity you requested (though we may have to
tweak the script of the on-chain tx to ensure the refund has
precedence).

As mentioned above, the ability to treat on-chain payments like any
other lightning channel transfer is very nice. It allows us to treat
the on-chain payments identically to off-chain payments (with the
caveat of confirmation times), so we can extend all our Lightning
schemes with on-chain hops :-)

Cheers,
Christian
