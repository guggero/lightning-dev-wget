Right, we can't use those fields, and 16 bytes is not sufficient to
identify the sender. But we could probably use it for a prefix lookup
in our routing table and then derive the payment preimage from
that. If this is the last hop the `channel_id` is also empty, and we
can use that as well. By defining a new realm we can also reorder the
fields to have 24 contiguous bytes.

</I>
Ah I see, I had a bit of trouble seeing how we could create a route
that commits to the 2 possible outcomes, since the HMAC commits to the
`amt_to_forward`, so there'd be no way of forwarding either wins or
losses. You're saying that the route simply stops at LD if we lose.

The XORing is quite interesting though I can't really see how it'd
work yet. LD would commit to a secret by sending you the hash, you
construct a route using that hash and your own pick (payment hash for
the second half) on the first half and then send the winnings back to
me using my own pick? How are you combining the LD hash and your own
hash to make it provably fair and giving LD the ability to pull the
payment in say 50% of the cases?

Cheers,
Christian
