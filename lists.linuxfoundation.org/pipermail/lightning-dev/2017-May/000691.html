<PRE>Hi Rusty,

Payment requests should also include a timestamp and an expiry date (they
could be optional tagged items but I think it makes more sense to make them
mandatory)
&#8203;
Thanks!
Fabrice&#8203;

</I>&gt;<i> that announcements take time to propagate through the network
</I>&gt;<i> (typically a few minutes with

</I>&gt;<i> we will need to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about not using our most recently created/closed channels as reference.
</I>&gt;<i> - we already know that we won't always be able to have a full view of
</I>&gt;<i> the network in
</I>&gt;<i> the future, so I feel like we should rely on it as less as possible
</I>&gt;<i> - since payment requests are sent out-of-band, optimizing their size
</I>&gt;<i> is maybe not as
</I>&gt;<i> important as messages exchanged on the p2p network?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;As you pointed out offline, we can do key recovery from the signature[1],
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;so the information is there already in fact :)  The chanid is really a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;courtesy, from this POV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is really amazing! Why not completely ditch the chanid then? ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi Rusty,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I was thinking of proposing something similar recently, but looks like
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; beat me to it!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I really like the flexibility of the tag format. Over the past few
</I>&gt;<i> months, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thought of quite a bit of things application developers can do by
</I>&gt;<i> utilizing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a tag-based payment request format in conjunction with either: the spare
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bytes of the onion payload or an abuse of the encrypted back errors (in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; combo with some onion payload bytes).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I thought about this too, but I'm reluctant to assign those onion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bytes as they're a limited resource.  Easy to add later, though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; On the topic of bech32: I'm all for piggybacking on existing emerging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; standards in the space, but I'm not convinced we really gain anything by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using it outside of the initial prefix. The human-readable amount
</I>&gt;<i> within the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; prefix is nice for UX as you can eyeball exactly how much one is about
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pay/receive. However, these payment requests can get rather long, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; envision any user typing them out by hand or reading them to someone
</I>&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the phone.  As a result, I don't think we have much use for bech32
</I>&gt;<i> character
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which has been optimized for manual-entry.  Additionally, as this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; includes a signature that covers the entire payreq, what's the use of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; added checksum? Detecting 3 characters out of 1024+ is rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; insignificant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I kind of agree, but I think the code reuse outweighs other arguments,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since codebases are going to have bech32 anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The minimal theoretical size we can do is 20 (payment hash160) + 64
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (signature).  We'd have to change the protocol to use hash160 instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sha256 (we already do this onchain).  But even that is 135 characters,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is not going to be entered by hand, so I don't think it's worth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; On the topic of signatures: as is proposed now, a user isn't able to
</I>&gt;<i> verify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the validity of the signature (and thereby authenticity of the payreq
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; integrity of the contents) without first having a (direction || chanID)
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pubKey mapping. In my opinion, the payreqs are already so long that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; optimizing for size is a bit of a waste. By replacing the chanID with
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; compressed serialized public key, users will be able to immediately
</I>&gt;<i> verify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the signature without the use of an external mapping.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so the information is there already in fact :)  The chanid is really a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; courtesy, from this POV.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think this is a good step in the right direction. However, it
</I>&gt;<i> utilizes an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; encoding whose rationale make sense for the Bitcoin address use-case,
</I>&gt;<i> but in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; my opinion, doesn't carry over those compelling traits to the LN payreq
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use-case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rusty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [1]  You also pointed out that we can use the same technique to remove
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      node-id and bitcoin-key from the channel announcement.  Which would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      be awesome magic...
