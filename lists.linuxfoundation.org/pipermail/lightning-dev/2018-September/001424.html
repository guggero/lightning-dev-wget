In my scenario, you're receiving a new HTLC, from some remote party
unbeknownst to you. I was replying to cdecker's reply to johan that one
wouldn't always add this new type of routing hint for all channels since it
leaks available bandwidth information. Without something like an &quot;unadd&quot; you
can't do anything against an individual attempting to prob you other than
drop packets (drop as in don't even add to your commit, resulting in an HTLC
timeout), as if you cancel back, then they know that you had enough
bandwidth to _accept_ the HTLC in the first place.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the bandwidth to actually accept and forward them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  You have to have a false capacity floor, which must vary
</I>&gt;<i> periodically, to protect against this kind of probing (randomly failing
</I>&gt;<i> attempts as you get close to zero capaicty is also subject to probing,
</I>&gt;<i> AFAICT).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since we don't yet have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;unadd&quot; feature in the protocol, you _must_ accept the HTLC before you
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cancel it. This is mitigated a bit by the max_htlc value in the channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update (basically our version of an MTU), but I can still just send
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _multiple_ HTLC's rather than one big one to attempt to ascertain your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available bandwidth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is orothogonal.  There's no point probing your own channel, you're
