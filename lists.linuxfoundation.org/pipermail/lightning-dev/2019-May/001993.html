<PRE>Hi Bastien,

thanks for investigating.

&gt;<i> I have been digging into Anthony Towns' anyprevout BIP
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/bip-anyprevout/bip-anyprevout.mediawiki">https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/bip-anyprevout/bip-anyprevout.mediawiki</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> proposal
</I>&gt;<i> to verify that it has everything we need for Eltoo
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf">https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The separation between anyprevout and anyprevoutanyscript is very handy
</I>&gt;<i> (compared to the previous noinput proposal).
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I'm missing something, it would simplify the funding tx (to a simple
</I>&gt;<i> multisig without cltv/csv) and remove the need for the trigger tx.
</I>
I think it makes sense for us to consider both variants, one committing
to the script and the other not committing to the script, but I think it
applies rather to the `update_tx` &lt;-&gt; `settlement_tx` link and less to
the `funding_tx` &lt;-&gt; `update_tx` link and `update_tx` &lt;-&gt; `update_tx`
link. The reason is that the `settlement_tx` needs to be limited to be
bindable only to the matching `update_tx` (`anyprevout`), while
`update_tx` need to be bindable to the `funding_tx` as well as any prior
`update_tx` which differ in the script by at least the state number
(hence `anyprevoutanyscript`).

Like AJ pointed out in another thread, the use of an explicit trigger
transaction is not really needed since any `update_tx` can act as a
trigger transaction (i.e., start the relative timeouts to tick). This
was an oversight of mine, which may have contributed more confusion than
necessary :-)

The `funding_tx` itself doesn't need any form of timeout, in fact
collaborative spending/closing without a timeout should always be
possible. The `settlement_tx`s can have a BIP68-style relative timelock,
which also saves us a few bytes.

&gt;<i> The more tricky part to integrate is the chaperone signature.
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand it correctly (which I'm not guaranteeing), we would need to
</I>&gt;<i> modify the update transactions to something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OP_IF
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     10 OP_CSV
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1 A(s,i) B(s,i) 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY          &lt;- public keys' first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> byte in this line is 0x02 or 0x03
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2 A(s,i) B(s,i) 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY          &lt;- public keys' first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> byte in this line is 0x00 or 0x01
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OP_ELSE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;S(i) + 1&gt; OP_CLTV
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1 A(u) B(u) 2  OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY          &lt;- public keys' first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> byte in this line is 0x02 or 0x03
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2 A(u) B(u) 2  OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY          &lt;- public keys' first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> byte in this line is 0x00 or 0x01
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OP_END
</I>
We could collapse those 1-of-2 multisigs into a single-sig if we just
collaboratively create a shared private key that is specific to the
instance of the protocol upon setup. That minimizes the extra space
needed.

Something that I notived talking to Jonas Nick is that we might have
some interaction between the taproot and noinput (or any of its aliases
:<i>D). Specifically we can't make make use of the collaborative path where
</I>we override an `update_tx` with a newer one in taproot as far as I can
see, since the `update_tx` needs to be signed with noinput (for
rebindability) but there is no way for us to specify the chaperone key
since we're not revealing the committed script.

&gt;<i> (I ommitted the tapscript changes, ie moving to OP_CHECKSIGADD, to
</I>&gt;<i> highlight only the chaperone changes)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When updating the channel, Alice and Bob would exchange their
</I>&gt;<i> anyprevoutanyscript signatures (for the 2-of-2 multisig).
</I>&gt;<i> The chaperone signature can be provided by either Alice or Bob at
</I>&gt;<i> transaction broadcast time (so that it commits to a specific input
</I>&gt;<i> transaction).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that using the same key for both signatures (the chaperone
</I>&gt;<i> one and the anyprevoutanyscript one) is safe here, but if someone knows
</I>&gt;<i> better I'm interested.
</I>&gt;<i> If that's unsafe, we simply need to introduce another key-pair (chaperone
</I>&gt;<i> key).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that how you guys understand it too? Do you have other ideas on how to
</I>&gt;<i> comply with the need for a chaperone signature?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that as Anthony said himself, the BIP isn't final and we don't know
</I>&gt;<i> yet if chaperone signatures will eventually be needed, but I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> useful to make sure that Eltoo could support it.
</I>
I quite like the chaperone idea, however it doesn't really play nice
with taproot collaborative spends that require anyprevout /
anyprevoutanyscript / noinput, which would make our transactions stand
out quite a bit. Then again this is only the case for the unhappy,
unilateral close, path of the protocol, which (hopfully) should happen
rarely.

Cheers,
Christian
