&gt;<i> the paper is a bit confusing regarding the setup transaction, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> not described formally. There also seems to be a mixup of &quot;setup
</I>&gt;<i> transaction&quot; and &quot;funding transaction&quot;, also named T_{u,0} without
</I>&gt;<i> showing it in the diagrams.
</I>
The setup transaction is simply a transaction that spends some funds and
creates a single output, which has the script from Figure 2, but since
that would be a forward reference, I decided to handwave and call it a
multisig. A simple fix would be to change the setup phase bullet point
at the beginning of section 3, would that be sufficient?

&gt;<i> In 3.1 the funding transaction is described as funding &quot;to a multisig
</I>&gt;<i> address&quot;. In the description of trigger transactions the change is
</I>&gt;<i> described as &quot;The output from the setup transaction is changed into a
</I>&gt;<i> simple 2-of-2 multisig output&quot; - which it already is?
</I>
If instead of calling it a multisig we call it a multiparty output and
reference the script in Figure 2, that'd be addressed as well.

&gt;<i> As far as I understand the situation, the trigger transaction is needed
</I>&gt;<i> because the broadcasted initial/funding/setup transaction includes an
</I>&gt;<i> OP_CLV, which then starts the timer and could lead to premature
</I>&gt;<i> settlement. Removing OP_CLV (and having in a transaction that is only
</I>&gt;<i> published later when it is needed), i.e. by changing it to a simple
</I>&gt;<i> multisig output, seems to solve this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you (Christian?) explain how the &quot;setup transaction&quot; is supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to look like without the changes described in section 4.2?
</I>
Well, it has arbitrary inputs, and a single output with the script from
Figure 2, in the non-trigger case, and in the trigger case it'd be just
a `2 A B 2 OP_CMSV`.
