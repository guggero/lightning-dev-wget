<PRE>I have been thinking a lot lately about attacks on lightning routing nodes,
the worst of which is the so-called Loop Attack [1]. See the mailing list
thread for more details, but the basic idea is that a sender and receiver
collude to create a long circuit and refuse to settle or fail the HTLC at
the end until the last possible moment. The attack is particularly
insidious for a few reasons. Firstly, an attack on a multi-hop route gives
the attacker leverage, so that their funds locked in one channel cause
funds to be locked up in every channel on the route. Second, the onion
routing makes it difficult to attribute blame to a single node and defend
against a repeated attack.

First, I'll note that the case where a sender and recipient collude is a
more active variant on an attack that any node in a route can perform. Even
if a node does not initiate the payment, it can just accept offered HTLCs
in the route, not forward them, and wait until the offered HTLC almost
expires before failing. As noted above, the prior node in the route cannot
determine whether the attacking node is at fault or one downstream from it.
Even the sender may not be able to determine where in the route the payment
failed because of the issue where the obfuscated error reason is not MAC'ed
on every hop.

There are two directions of solutions I have heard: 1) protocol support for
decrypting the onion route if the HTLC is kept in-flight for too long 2)
requiring fees even if the payment fails as a cost to the attacker 3) some
sort of reputation system for nodes.

Option 1 I'm afraid may be quite complex. Say this mechanism kicks in and
all nodes in the circuit deobfuscate the route and are able to see the
delays at each hop. The outcome we hope for is that there is one node
clearly to blame and the prior hop in the route fails all channels with
them. However, the attacker can of course control multiple successive hops
in the route, one that looks innocent in front of one that looks guilty,
then keep the channel alive and try again. So then all nodes need to keep a
record of the full circuits and iteratively shift blame up the chain if bad
HTLCs keep going through those channels.

Option 2 is also problematic because it only protects against the case
where the sender is colluding with the receiver, and not where a routing
node is opportunistically delaying payments. This would, however, likely be
successful against nodes being annoying and sending tons of payments with
randomly generated payment hashes in order to &quot;ping&quot; a circuit.

Option 3 has become my preferred solution. The idea is that that for each
node that one has channels with, it only forwards payments through them if
they have a good history, otherwise it fails the payment. Notably, we
ignore whether the downstream hop is directly responsible for delaying a
payment or whether they are simply willing to forward to another node that
is intentionally delaying -- both should be considered bad behavior. In my
opinion, this type of solution fits best into the Lightning model of
independent, linked channels where each node has private contracts with its
direct peers. It also is the simplest in the context of onion routing
because if you are offered an HTLC to route, the only decision you can make
is whether to forward it or fail it based on the amount, previous hop, and
next hop. When I refer to &quot;reputation&quot; hereafter, I do not mean a global
reputation that is gossiped about -- just a local view of a peer's history.

For a Sybil-resistant reputation system, we can use money as a way of
measuring reputation. Fees collected through routing payments across
channels raise the reputation of the channel peer. You lose reputation by
accepting an HTLC and not failing or fulfilling it quickly, proportional to
the value of the HTLC and time to respond. What this essentially means is
that if an attacker wants people to send them HTLCs to delay, they pay a
certain amount in fees over time. So each node will track for each peer 1)
total fees collected from forwarding on routes where that peer is the prior
hop 2) total fees collect from forwarding on routes where that peer is the
next hop 3) total value times time of money locked in offered HTLCs on
channels to the peer. To track the third, as soon as an offered HTLC is
locked in by the peer, the node starts a timer. When the HTLC is settled or
failed or handled on-chain, the timer stops and the node registers the
total elapsed time multiplied by the value of the HTLC.

A very simple strategy would be to have two factors, R_inbound and
R_outbound and calculate reputation per peer as R_inbound * total inbound
fees + R_outbound * total outbound fees - total Bitcoin-seconds locked in
an HTLC. When forwarding a payment, you calculate the worst case reputation
loss, HTLC value * (CLTV - current block height) * 10 min / block, and fail
the payment if that value is greater than their current score. Effectively,
reputation scores are the maximum number of Bitcoin-seconds on could waste
in HTLCs as the downstream node in a channel. If you think, for example,
having 1 BTC for 1 hour is worth 1 satoshi, you might set R_inbound =
R_outbound = 10^8. Honest nodes should earn reputation passively by
forwarding payments and failing/fulfilling quickly, while an attacker would
lose reputation and have to pay fees to re-earn it. Furthermore, high
reputation nodes should be able to earn reputation faster since peers will
be willing to forward higher value HTLCs through them.

We want an additional property from this system though, which is that an
attacker be limited in their ability to disrupt network connectivity and
induce throttling on other channels. The above scheme has the problem that
for every unit of reputation the attacker loses, each upstream hop also
loses approximately the same amount -- they effectively get leverage on the
ability to reduce reputation. So instead, consider a modification: each hop
loses a quantity of reputation units equal to the *total* amount of
Bitcoin-seconds lost upstream. So say there's a payment A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D,
where the CLTV decrements by 12 and the amount decrements by 10 satoshis at
each hop, with a terminal CLTV of 12 and a terminal amount of 100. So A
tells B &quot;Here's an HTLC for 120 satoshis, CLTV is in 36 blocks, and you
will lose reputation at a rate of 120 satoshi-seconds per second of delay&quot;.
B calculates the maximum he could lose by forwarding to C as 120 * 36
blocks * 10 min / block. Assuming C has a high enough reputation score, B
will offer an HTLC of 110 satoshis, CLTV of 24 blocks, reputation rate of
120 + 110 = 230 satoshi-seconds per second. And finally C requires D to
stake reputation at a rate of 230 + 100 = 330 satoshi-seconds / second. The
effect is that if any node withholds the preimage, they lose an amount of
reputation equal to all of the reputation lost upstream combined, removing
any attack leverage.

This strategy has some downsides, namely in terms of centralization and
privacy. Telling the downstream node the rate at which they must stake
reputation may allow them to determine the number of upstream hops in the
circuit. To obfuscate this, the sender may require an addition reputation
stake, but takes a higher risk of the payment failing somewhere downstream.
The more obvious issue is centralization -- if payments are getting
throttled by reputation, there is even more of an incentive to route
through a small number of channels and decrease the length of payment
circuits. While this is a concern, the degree to while throttling happens
in controlled by the R parameters (the ratio at which fees contribute to
reputation). If R is high and reputation is abundant, then there will be
little throttling. But if a node finds itself under attack, it can raise
its R parameters and start throttling bad peers.

In summary, I think a simple local reputation mechanism of this form could
be implemented with only minor changes to the BOLT spec and could provide
decent resistance against DOS/loop attacks. Sorry for the excessively long
email.
