<PRE>Good morning CJP, Rusty, and list,

&gt;<i> &gt; But why do we need consensus at all? There are two versions of each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commitment transaction: one to be used for unilateral close by one peer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (A), and one to be used by the other (B). Peer A has an interest in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;commit transaction A&quot;, so I'd consider it fair to let peer A pay the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction fee for that commit tx (subtracted from its part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; channel funds), and also to let peer A determine the amount of that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fee. If A wants a different fee for whatever reason, it should simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to ask B for a signature on an updated &quot;commit transaction A&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B shouldn't care about that fee, as long as its own funds, HTLCs etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are OK.
</I>
I was thinking this myself.

&gt;<i> We can make them independent (with some twists for the initial case
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where A holds all the funds and must of necessity pay for B's fee too),
</I>
Perhaps the twisting could be made relatively minimal: at initial funding, assuming `push_msat=0`, then B does not in fact require a commitment transaction: it could just completely forget the channel ever existed, as it has no stake in the channel.

And in the case `push_msat!=0`, then B *does* have funds in the channel with which to pay the onchain fee.

&gt;<i> Even fixing this is insufficient: neither side may end up being happy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> with the fees when it comes to use the commitment tx.
</I>
Yes, this is indeed an issue...


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that Eltoo works around this by always being a single input/output
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> pair with SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY (and relying on
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SIGHASH_NOINPUT) so you can attach fees later without this bloat issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This works for Decker-Russell-Osuntokun trigger and update transactions, but not for settlement transactions.  But then settlement transactions do not have their outputs encumbered with a CSV (it is the settlement transaction itself which is so encumbered), hence allowing direct CPFP.

The same technique cannot be used in Poon-Dryja even with `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, since commitment transactions often have multiple outputs.
