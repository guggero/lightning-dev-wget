The typical address re-use doesn't apply here as this is a sighash flag that
would only really be used for doing various contracts on Bitcoin. I don't
see any reason why &quot;regular&quot; wallets would update to use this sighash flag.
We've also seen first hand with segwit that wallet authors are slow to pull
in the latest and greatest features available, even if they solve nuisance
issues like malleability and can result in lower fees.

IMO, sighash_none is an even bigger footgun that already exists in the
protocol today.
