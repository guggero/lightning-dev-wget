If I can convince you to sign with SIGHASH_NONE, it's already a problem
today.

&gt;<i> I wonder if it wouldn't be ... I'm not sure better is the right word,
</I>&gt;<i> but perhaps &quot;more realistic&quot; to have _NOINPUT be a flag to a signature
</I>&gt;<i> for a hypothetical &quot;OP_CHECK_SIG_FOR_SINGLE_USE_KEY&quot; opcode instead,
</I>&gt;<i> so that it's fundamentally not possible to trick someone who regularly

</I>&gt;<i> spends of other inputs as well.
</I>
That was also suggested by Mark Friedenbach, but I think we'll end up
with more &quot;magic key&quot; a-la Schnorr/taproot/graftroot and less script in
future.

That means we'd actually want a different Segwit version for
&quot;NOINPUT-can-be-used&quot;, which seems super ugly.

&gt;<i> Maybe a different opcode maybe makes sense at a &quot;philosophical&quot; level:
</I>&gt;<i> normal signatures are signing a spend of a particular &quot;coin&quot; (in the
</I>&gt;<i> UTXO sense), while _NOINPUT signatures are in some sense signing a spend
</I>&gt;<i> of an entire &quot;wallet&quot; (all the coins spendable by a particular key, or
</I>&gt;<i> more accurately for the current proposal, all the coins of a particular
</I>&gt;<i> value spendable by a particular key). Those are different intentions,
</I>&gt;<i> so maybe it's reasonable to encode them in different addresses, which
</I>&gt;<i> in turn could be done by having a new opcode for _NOINPUT.
</I>
In a world where SIGHASH_NONE didn't exist, this might be an argument :)

Cheers,
Rusty.
