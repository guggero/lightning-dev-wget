coalesce all the second-layer HTLCs for a particularly state+party into a
single transaction with a single signature spending all HTLCs to the second
layer/stage.

&gt;<i> Good morning Pedro,

</I>&gt;<i> This is certainly of great interest to me; unfortunately I am not a
</I>&gt;<i> mathematician and probably cannot review if the math is correct or not.  In
</I>&gt;<i> particular it seems to me, naively, to be able to implement my AMP idea
</I>&gt;<i> which supports both path decorrelation and proof-of-payment, which is based
</I>&gt;<i> on SS and HD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Lightning BOLT 1.0 spec is mostly frozen and we have good
</I>&gt;<i> inter-implementation working of HTLCs.  Supporting SS, whether on top of
</I>&gt;<i> ECDSA or Bellare-Neven, will be a large effort, and it is not clear to me
</I>&gt;<i> if it is easy to switch between ECDSA and Bellare-Neven dynamically (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> if one hop supports ECDSA SS and the next hop supports Bellare-Neven SS).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is also not clear to me how well B-N signature aggregation can work for
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning use-cases; certainly onchain claims of unilateral closes can be
</I>&gt;<i> made smaller with signature aggregation, but for mutual closes, there is
</I>&gt;<i> only one input, unless we support close aggregation somehow (involving more
</I>&gt;<i> than two parties, so much more effort).  A 2-of-2 with a single signature
</I>&gt;<i> (which I believe is the basis of your SS work?) would let the mutual close
</I>&gt;<i> and commitment transactions be smaller by one signature and one pubkey,
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the Lightning BOLT spec level:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  We need a new global feature bit, `option_support_scriptless`, which
</I>&gt;<i> would support routing of scriptless-script conditional payments.  Paying
</I>&gt;<i> via SS can only be done if the entire route supports this option, which may
</I>&gt;<i> hamper adoption and complicate routing implementations (cannot route an SS
</I>&gt;<i> payment through nodes that do not  support SS).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Depending on how easy it would be to translate between ECDSA and
</I>&gt;<i> Bellare-Neven SS, maybe only a local-level feature bit for
</I>&gt;<i> `option_support_scriptless_ecdsa` and `option_support_scriptless_bn`?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Also affects BOLT11 as we would have to support both `SHA256(secret)`
</I>&gt;<i> and `secret * G` in invoices, with the latter being used for SS payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  We may want intra-path decorrelation (indeed, aside from AMP, this is
</I>&gt;<i> the other use of SS on Lightning).  This requires passing a blinding secret
</I>&gt;<i> to each layer of the onion in the onion routes, I think (?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
