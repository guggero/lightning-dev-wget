<PRE>One more point in terms of information leakage is that noise can be added
to the &quot;this is the rate that you'll lose reputation at&quot; field to help
obfuscate the number of upstream hops. I proposed setting it to &quot;this is
the upstream rate that I'm losing reputation at&quot; + downstream HTLC value,
but a node can decide to add noise. If they make it too low however,
there's a risk of insufficiently punishing bad nodes and if they make it
too high, there's a heightened risk that the payment fails because the
downstream reputation is insufficient along the route.

This is why I say it's kind of symmetric to the CLTV value: if the delta is
too low, there's risk of loss of funds, if the delta is too high, someone
might decide to fail the payment instead of taking the delay risk.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, that is a good point. I still find the proposal overall worryingly
</I>&gt;<i> complex in terms of communication overhead, time it takes to prove channel
</I>&gt;<i> closure, all of your points in [1], [2], [3], etc. Furthermore, this
</I>&gt;<i> mandates that immediate channel closure is the only allowed reaction to a
</I>&gt;<i> party delaying an HTLC for a time period above a threshold -- the node
</I>&gt;<i> reputation approach gives more discretion to the preceding hop.
</I>&gt;<i> Deobfuscating the route may turn out to be the right option, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> the reputation system has certain advantages over this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The models we tried in Milan all created an incentive to fail payments,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is a non-starter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mind elaborating or summarizing the reasons? The way I'm analyzing
</I>&gt;<i> it, even if there's a nominal spam fee paid to routing nodes that fail
</I>&gt;<i> payments, as long as it's low enough (say 2-5% for arguments sake), the
</I>&gt;<i> nodes still have more to gain by forwarding the payment and earning the
</I>&gt;<i> full fee on a completed payment, and possibly the reputation boost
</I>&gt;<i> associated with completing a payment if that system was in effect.
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, a node that constantly fails payments will be blacklisted by the
</I>&gt;<i> sender eventually and stop receiving HTLCs from them at all. Overall, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think this is a profitable strategy. Furthermore, I think it works
</I>&gt;<i> quite well in combination with the reputation system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems like we'd need some serious evaluation to show that this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works, because the risks are very high.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that it needs to be evaluated. I may start working on some network
</I>&gt;<i> simulations to test various DOS mitigation strategies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can destroy your node's reputation by routing crap through you; even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it costs me marginaly more reputation than it does you, that just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means that the largest players can force failure upon smaller players,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; centralizing the network.  And I think trying to ensure that it costs me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more reputation than the sum of downstream reputation loss leaks too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much information
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will add to ZmnSCPxj's response, which is mostly on point. The key here
</I>&gt;<i> is that the only way to lose significant reputation is to delay a payment
</I>&gt;<i> yourself or forward to a malicious downstream that delays -- neither of
</I>&gt;<i> these can be forced by the sender alone. This amounts to a system where you
</I>&gt;<i> are on the hook for any malicious behavior of your downstream peers, which
</I>&gt;<i> is why you must keep a reputation score for each which they earn over time.
</I>&gt;<i> This should keep all links in the network high quality and quickly
</I>&gt;<i> disconnect off delaying nodes if the incentives are right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I agree that a lot of reputation is leaked by aggregating the losses
</I>&gt;<i> along the route, this serves exactly to prevent large nodes with high
</I>&gt;<i> reputation from ruining links elsewhere. There are two things a node
</I>&gt;<i> looking to cause reputation loss could do. 1) Identify a node (not itself)
</I>&gt;<i> it thinks will delay a payment and send to them. This locks up funds on
</I>&gt;<i> their behalf, but is actually good behavior because it identifies a faulty
</I>&gt;<i> node and rightfully forces a loss in their reputation, eventually resulting
</I>&gt;<i> in them being booted from the network. Everyone upstream loses some
</I>&gt;<i> reputation for having connectivity to them, but less because of the loss
</I>&gt;<i> aggregation along the route. 2) Delay a payment oneself and force upstream
</I>&gt;<i> reputation loss. This is why I think it's important that the reputation
</I>&gt;<i> loss aggregate so that the malicious party loses the most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the amount of information leaked, yes, it helps determine the
</I>&gt;<i> number of upstream hops in a route. However, the CLTV values help determine
</I>&gt;<i> the number of downstream hops in a route in exactly the same way. I see
</I>&gt;<i> these as symmetric in a sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To address ZmnSCPxj's point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But it also looks more and more like a policy of &quot;just
</I>&gt;<i> `update_htlc_fail`&quot; keeps our reputation high: indeed never accepting a
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding attempt would ensure reputation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, earning via fees should help provide incentive against &quot;Just
</I>&gt;<i> `update_htlc_fail`&quot; always.  If the goal is &quot;how do I earn money fastest&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> then there is some optimal threshhold &gt; of risk-of-reputation-loss vs.
</I>&gt;<i> fee-earnings-if-I-forward that is unlikely to be near the &quot;Just fail it&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum, but somewhere in between.  We hope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly the question that your local view of peer reputations
</I>&gt;<i> helps solve: are the potential fees here worth the risk of forwarding this
</I>&gt;<i> payment to this downstream? If their reputation is high, then you will want
</I>&gt;<i> to forward because you think there's a low chance of you incurring
</I>&gt;<i> reputation loss. If their reputation is low and the HTLC value is too high,
</I>&gt;<i> you will fail it. So I disagree that &quot;just `update_htlc_fail`&quot; is an
</I>&gt;<i> optimal strategy. Consider as well that all fees you earn on successful
</I>&gt;<i> payments are profit to you as well as a reputation boost in the view of
</I>&gt;<i> both of your peers. So in order to earn reputation, you have to forward
</I>&gt;<i> payments. The key is not forwarding through malicious peers.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good morning Rusty, Jim, and list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I can destroy your node's reputation by routing crap through you; even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; if it costs me marginaly more reputation than it does you, that just

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; centralizing the network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My understanding of the proposal was that reputation loss would occur
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only if the reply (`update_htlc_fail` or `update_htlc_success`) is delayed;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this means that for you to force me to lose reputation, you need to somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make me delay my reply.  In particular if you do simple things like give me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an invalid onion, or make me forward to a payee who does not know the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preimage, I do not lose reputation by replying very quickly with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `update_htlc_fail`.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, a large player could force reputation loss by delaying reply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when they receive, and having patsy nodes route to them.  So for instance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it is Jim -&gt; ZmnSCPxj -&gt; Rusty, and Rusty activates the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blockstream-takes-over-the-world Apocalypse program, the Rusty node
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would then delay for a long time before replying, which makes my reputation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suffer.  But it also makes Rusty reputation suffer even more and my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reaction would be that, the next time Jim hands me an HTLC that forwards to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rusty, I would instead quickly `update_htlc_fail` back to Jim (which does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not lose me significant reputation due to my quick response) than risk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forwarding it to you, since you have a reputation for being slow and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unresponsive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed, another aspect of Jim proposal is that it is extremely local: if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jim has no channel to Rusty, then Jim has no opinion about Rusty, only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about ZmnSCPxj.  However, ZmnSCPxj does have an opinion about Rusty, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj has channel with Rusty.  If I suffer too much reputation loss due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Rusty, my opinion of Rusty drops even faster, and I decide to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `update_htlc_fail` in order to prevent Jim opinion of me from dropping too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much that Jim decides not to forward to me (if I have other channels with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more reasonable nodes).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But it also looks more and more like a policy of &quot;just

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; much information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, this is a major drawback of the proposal.  The rate at which the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sender of the HTLC threatens me with reputation loss lets me estimate my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distance from the ultimate sender of the funds.
