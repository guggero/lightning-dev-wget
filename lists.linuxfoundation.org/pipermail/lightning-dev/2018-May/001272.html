<PRE>Hi,

Maybe this is a stupid question, and it is late so maybe I'm
overlooking something, but I don't want to lose a potentially good
idea, so here it goes:

Right now, BOLT#3 imposes a certain algorithm for fee estimation. This
algorithm is likely to be sub-optimal: fee estimation is a difficult
subject, and may involve subjective situation-specific considerations
of participants. I guess it's only there to achieve some kind of
consensus between the peers.

But why do we need consensus at all? There are two versions of each
commitment transaction: one to be used for unilateral close by one peer
(A), and one to be used by the other (B). Peer A has an interest in
&quot;commit transaction A&quot;, so I'd consider it fair to let peer A pay the
transaction fee for that commit tx (subtracted from its part of the
channel funds), and also to let peer A determine the amount of that
fee. If A wants a different fee for whatever reason, it should simply
be able to ask B for a signature on an updated &quot;commit transaction A&quot;.
B shouldn't care about that fee, as long as its own funds, HTLCs etc.
are OK.

I guess, when only changing the fee, you don't even need to use a new
revocation secret. Your peer may have different versions which only
differ in how much fees your peer pays, and you 'll never care which of
them will be used by your peer. Not using a new revocation secret may
or may not be a premature optimization though.

If a peer doesn't have enough funds to pay a reasonably effective tx
fee, normally that shouldn't be a problem, because then it doesn't have
a significant financial interest in having a usable commit tx either.
The only exception is if there are significant HTLCs. Is this where the
idea breaks down? As far as I can see, this is an exceptional (but
important) case, but during normal operation, peers should be free to
choose the fee for their own commit tx.

You'd have to deal with any follow-up transactions as well: changing a
fee changes the txID, so you need to update follow-up transactions.

regards,
CJP
