<PRE>FWIW, Conner pointed out that the initial ZK Proof for the correctness of
the
Paillier params (even w/ usage of bulletproofs) has multiple rounds of
interaction,
iirc up to 5+ (with additional pipelining) rounds of interaction.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Pedro,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very cool stuff! When I originally discovered the Lindell's technique, my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immediate thought was the we could phase this in as a way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _immediately_ (no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional Script upgrades required), replace the regular 2-of-2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mulit-sig with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a single p2wkh. The immediate advantages of this would: be lower fees for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening/closing channels (as the public key script, and witness are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openings and cooperative close transactions would blend in with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anonymity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set of regular p2wkh transactions, and finally the htlc timeout+success
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions can be made smaller as we can remove the multi-sig. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> benefit is nerfed a bit if the channel are advertised, but non-advertised
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channels would be able to take advantage of this &quot;stealth&quot; feature.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The upside of the original application I hand in mind is that it wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require any end-to-end changes, as it would only be a link level change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (diff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> output for the funding transaction). If we wanted to allow these styles of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channels to be used outside of non-advertised channels, then we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> update the way channels are verified in the gossip layer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Applying this to the realm of allowing us to use randomized payment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identifiers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> across the route is obviously much, much doper. So then the question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the process of integrating the scheme into the existing protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look like. The primary thing we'd need to account for is the additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cryptographic overhead this scheme would add if integrated. Re-reviewing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paper, there's an initial setup and verification phase (which was omitted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> y'alls note for brevity) where both parties need to complete before the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually signing process can take place. Ideally, we can piggy-back this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on top of the existing accept_channel/open_channel dance both sides need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through in order to advance the channel negotiation process today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Conner actually started to implement this when we first discovered the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scheme,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so we have a pretty good feel w.r.t the implementation of the initial set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proofs. The three proofs required for the set up phase are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. A proof that that the Paillier public key is well formed. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   they only execute this step for the party that wishes to _obtain_ the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   signature. In our case, since we'll need to sign for HTLCs in both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   directions, but parties will need to execute this step.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2. A dlog proof for the signing keys themselves. We already do this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   less, as if the remote party isn't able to sign with their target key,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   we won't be able to update the channel, or even create a valid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commitment in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the first place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   3. A proof that value encrypted (the Paillier ciphertext) is actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   dlog of the public key to be used for signing. (as an aside this is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   of the protocol that made me do a double take when first reading it:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   cryptosystem to encrypt the private key of another cryptosystem in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   construct a 2pc to allow signing in the latter cryptosystem! soo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clever!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, we'll examine the initial proof. This only needs to be done once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parties AFAICT. As a result, we may be able to piggyback this onto the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel funding steps. Reviewing the paper cited on the Lindell paper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1], it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears this would take 1 RTT, so this shouldn't result in any additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> round
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trips during the funding process. We should be able to use a Paillier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modulos
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of 2048 bits, so nothing too crazy. This would just result in a slightly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bigger
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening message.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Skipping the second proofs as it's pretty standard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The third proof as described (Section 6 of the Lindell paper) is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interactive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It also contains a ZK range proof as a sub-protocol which as described in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Appendix A is also interactive. However, it was pointed out to us by Omer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shlomovits on the lnd slack, that we can actually replace their custom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> range
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proofs with Bulletproofs. This would make this section non-interactive,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowing the proof itself to take 1.5 RTT AFAICT. Additionally, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to be done once at the start, as AFIACT, we can re-use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encryption of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the secp256k1 private key of both parties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The current channel opening process requires 2 RTT, so it seems that we'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to easily piggy back all the opening proofs on top of the existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol. The main cost would be the increased size of these opening
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and also the additional computational cost of operations within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Paillier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modulus and the new range proof.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The additional components that would need to be modified are the process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adding+settling an HTLC, and also the onion payload that drops off the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whose dlog is r_1*alpha. Within the current protocol, adding and settling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLC are more or less non-interactive, we have a single message for each,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is then staged to be committed in new commitments for both parties. With
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new scheme (if I follow it correctly), adding an HTLC now requires N RTT:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. Alice sends A = G*alpha to Bob. Here alpha is the payment secret.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2. Bob sends R_3 = (G*alpha)*r_2 (along w/ a proof of knowledge of r_2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   relation to A)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   3. Alice sends R_3' = (G*alpha)*r_3 (along with a similar proof as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above) 4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Bob then computes c3 (the encrypted partial sig which when completed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   reveal a) to Alice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   5. Alice decrypts c3 to get the plaintext partial sig (s'), then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finalizes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the set up by sending s'' to Bob.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This process takes 2.5 RTT, and would require re-working the state machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slightly to only actually commit an HTLC after step 5 has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completed.  When
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bob obtains a from the next party in the path, we Alice can then then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signature, from which Alice can extract alpha. So adding HTLCs is now a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more interactive, but settling them is the same a before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, the onion payload would need to be re-interpreted in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> G*alpha which takes 33 bytes. We can shave this down to 32 by selecting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coordinate (at the sender) to always be either even or odd. Currently, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 12 unused bytes in the onion payload. The HMAC is currently 32 bytes. One
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> path
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be to allocate a portion of HMAC space to encoding this point. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 16-byte
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HMAC would probably have been enough in the beginning, so we can drop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that. However, that still leaves 4 bytes somewhere that has to give...one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either obtain these extra bytes from the CLTV and Amount fields, or just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each hop consume an extra payload. The latter path would mean that the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upper hop limit is actually 10.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, given that we would need need a new global feature bit in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> roll this out, it may make sense to re-work the onion format all together
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would mean that we wouldn't need to hack the old format a bit to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accommodate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this additional data. One aspect of introducing a new end-to-end contract
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I hadn't considered before is that each new type effectively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partitions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the network. This is due to the fact that these HTLCs will now only be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be carried along paths that understand this new feature. As a result,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plausible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> path diversity takes as we can no longer utilize all channels on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for routing. This would suggest that introducing new end to end contract
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> types
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (if one wishes to use them widely across arbitrary channels and not for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific contract protocols) may be a strong point of synchronization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> w.r.t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updates across the network. As a result, we may need to be a bit more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discerning w.r.t new candidates for e2e contracts given the coordination
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> costs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the takeaways are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * we can probably piggy back the extra proofs onto the channel opening
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       * one of the subproofs can use bulletproofs to make the proof
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shorter and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         also non-interactive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * adding an HTLC would take 2.5 RTT's, but settling is just as quick as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * the onion payload would either need to be hacked, or extended to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     packaging the point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * the utility of the scheme won't shine until all/most of the network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uses it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * we could start w/ just the introduction of the OG 2PC scheme as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multi-sig
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     replacement
