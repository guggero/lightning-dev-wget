<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,
       Thank you for the clarification.I got your point.

&gt;<i> Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for the clarification. Sorry for misinterpreting the paper of
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous multihop lock. A bit of rephrasing of what I exactly meant and
</I>&gt;<i> apologies for describing vaguely. Following your discussion on griefing
</I>&gt;<i> attack, it is clear the payer and payee wants to intentionally deprive
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes, by colluding. However, by griefing (a misnomer for this
</I>&gt;<i> situation) I didn't mean exactly withholding the solution but something
</I>&gt;<i> like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given S-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;F-&gt;R, S, B and F are controlled by the same
</I>&gt;<i> adversary and considering all the parties have completed the lock phase.
</I>&gt;<i> Now R triggers release phase and F gets x_r from R. However, F adds x_f to
</I>&gt;<i> x_r forwards it directly to B, doesn't complete signature with E and
</I>&gt;<i> cancels the HTLC just before the elapse of expiration time, E terminates
</I>&gt;<i> its HTLC with D and so on. B has x_c+x_d+x_e+x_f+x_r (shared by F and
</I>&gt;<i> shared by S). It continues normally completing payment with A and then S. I
</I>&gt;<i> am not sure whether again this attack makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If S controls F, then it could have just forwarded F-&gt;R directly without
</I>&gt;<i> involving C D E at all, so in both cases C D E would also not earn any
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding fees; instead now C D E learn of this payment, so the collusion
</I>&gt;<i> S B F just unnecessarily leaks its intent to pay R by doing this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, S B F cannot steal funds from C D E by this method, it can only
</I>&gt;<i> grief them, but it could grief C D E by just B and F, not involving any S
</I>&gt;<i> or R, so this does not increase the attack surface at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I do not see the point of this exercise; S controls F anyway, so it
</I>&gt;<i> could just as well have forwarded F-&gt;R directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi ZmnSCPxj,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      Thanks for the explanation. Pardon my knowledge in this domain
</I>&gt;<i> but what I meant is that sender has malicious intent and wants honest
</I>&gt;<i> parties to suffer. So by leaking secrets, I meant not revealing its or
</I>&gt;<i> receiver's identity to the forwarding nodes, but somehow manipulating
</I>&gt;<i> subset of the nodes so that an attack can be launched in the network. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, consider path S-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;F-&gt;R. If we consider the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous multihop lock, S samples secret x_a,x_b,x_c,x_d,x_e,x_f for the
</I>&gt;<i> nodes A,B,C,D,E and F respectively. R gets the key
</I>&gt;<i> k=x_a+x_b+x_c+x_d+x_e+x_f. If S colludes with B (possibly leak the value
</I>&gt;<i> x_c,x_d,x_e,x_f to B), lock funds C,D,E but then not allowing it to relay
</I>&gt;<i> funds (possibly do a griefing attack?). What I meant is that if one totally
</I>&gt;<i> relies on S for the setup phase, won't it lead to other vulnerabilities?
</I>&gt;<i> The situation might sound unrealistic but I still have doubt whether we
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee fairness if put our trust entirely on one single entity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Note that in the context of PTLCs, R does not get a key (as in private
</I>&gt;<i> key) of x_a+x_b+x_c+x_d+x_e+x_f.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Instead, R still continues to use its normal private key for claiming
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC/PTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We simply have R generate an adaptor signature first and hand that
</I>&gt;<i> over to F, such that completing the signature and publishing it onchain
</I>&gt;<i> will reveal a secret x_r (which is NOT the node privkey of R).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What happens really here is that each hop sets up a PTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The sender is responsible for ensuring that the F-&gt;R PTLC is equal to
</I>&gt;<i> x_r * G, that E-&gt;F is equal to (x_f + x_r) * G, that D-&gt;E is equal to (x_e
</I>&gt;<i> + x_f + x_r) * G, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However,  the sender knows only (x_r * G) without knowing x_r, thus it
</I>&gt;<i> never is able to completely control the secret at every point -- the
</I>&gt;<i> receiver knows the other secret as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That is the entire crux of the argument --- *both* sender and receiver
</I>&gt;<i> control the secrets anyway, so it is not controlled by a single entity, at
</I>&gt;<i> least for non-self-payments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; If S colludes with B (possibly leak the value x_c,x_d,x_e,x_f to B),
</I>&gt;<i> lock funds C,D,E but then not allowing it to relay funds (possibly do a
</I>&gt;<i> griefing attack?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Griefing attacks are only possible by not claiming or forwarding the
</I>&gt;<i> attack.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If S and B &quot;collude&quot; to perform a grief, then either B never forwards
</I>&gt;<i> to C, in which case there is no possible way to attack, or C receives it
</I>&gt;<i> and claims it but B does not claim it, in which case B paid out money and
</I>&gt;<i> is now idiotically refusing to claim money.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Grief attacks are attacks by payers and payees on intermediate nodes
</I>&gt;<i> (S and R attacking A,B,C,D,E,F), and in that case the entire payment secret
</I>&gt;<i> would be known by both S and R anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So S and B cannot cooperate to perform a griefing attack on the path.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Commenting on it : &quot;As for ZmnSCPxj's suggestion, I think there
</I>&gt;<i> is the same kind of issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The secrets we establish with anonymous multi-hops locks are
</I>&gt;<i> between the *sender*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and each of the hops. In the route blinding case, what we're
</I>&gt;<i> adding are secrets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between the *recipient* and the hops, and we don't want the
</I>&gt;<i> sender to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; influence those.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it a good idea to rely entirely on the sender for sampling
</I>&gt;<i> the secrets as well as generating the PTLC? As happens in anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> multi-hops locks, for example. Or as it has been discussed later in the
</I>&gt;<i> thread, both receiver and sender must be involved in creation of PTLC? What
</I>&gt;<i> happens if sender/receiver is/(or both are) corrupted? Can it leak secrets
</I>&gt;<i> to other parties?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If both are corrupted, this brings up the question: who are you
</I>&gt;<i> hiding any information from?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The corruptor has already corrupted both: there is no security or
</I>&gt;<i> privacy possible, the payment is already totally compromised.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The operation of forwarding nodes is simple enough that in general
</I>&gt;<i> they cannot be attacked: sure, the sender and receiver together knows who
</I>&gt;<i> they are, but forwarding nodes are the ones who advertise themselves in
</I>&gt;<i> order to be forwarded through, so they already are known anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When considering privacy, we should always consider that it is the
</I>&gt;<i> payment as a whole which we want to have privacy: we want that third
</I>&gt;<i> parties will not be able to nail down which particular sender sent to which
</I>&gt;<i> particular receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus if the sender already leaks who it is paying to, that is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much the entire loss of privacy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, currently on Lightning, in general the receiver does not know
</I>&gt;<i> the sender node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Applications on top of Lightning might have the receiver require
</I>&gt;<i> the sender to provide private data, such as a drop point to send a physical
</I>&gt;<i> product to, but *looking only on Lightning* the sender does not send any of
</I>&gt;<i> its information to the receiver).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, currently, the exact receiver node has to be known by the
</I>&gt;<i> sender, in order for the sender to make a route to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a concern since it may be possible for layer-crossing
</I>&gt;<i> shenanigans to be performed, for example the sender might attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse the receiver on the Bitcoin blockchain layer and make it lose funds
</I>&gt;<i> by not realizing that a PTLC/HTLC has been timed out (because the eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> attack prevents new blocks from propagating to the receiver, who blithely
</I>&gt;<i> continues to think that the timeout has not been reached when in fact it
</I>&gt;<i> has).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The proposal to have a receiver provide a partial, blinded path
</I>&gt;<i> gives the receiver better privacy protection against the sender: the sender
</I>&gt;<i> knows it is one of a possible number of nodes within some number of hops
</I>&gt;<i> from a particular node, but does not know if it is that exact node, one of
</I>&gt;<i> its neighbors, or one of its neighbor neighbors (etc.) is the actual
</I>&gt;<i> receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This should make it harder for the sender to attack the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> by attempting to locate its node and eclipse it at the Bitcoin layer, or
</I>&gt;<i> other blockchain-layer shenanigans.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, the argument I make is that while the blinding factors in a
</I>&gt;<i> decorrelated PTLC-based payment may be generated by the sender in order for
</I>&gt;<i> the sender to have path privacy, it is safe for the receiver to provide
</I>&gt;<i> blinding factors to a partial path as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should remember that the blinding factors are just scalars
</I>&gt;<i> added to the final point/scalar at the ultimate recipient, and the final
</I>&gt;<i> point/scalar pair is completely controlled by the recipient anyway, so it
</I>&gt;<i> should not be an issue here: the point that the sender will target at the
</I>&gt;<i> first node in the receiver-provided partial route is no different from the
</I>&gt;<i> final point that the sender would have targeted if it knew exactly who the
</I>&gt;<i> receiver is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
