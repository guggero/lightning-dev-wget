<PRE>&gt;<i> So what is needed is to allow B to add fees to HTLC-Timeout:

Indeed, anchors as defined in #lightning-rfc/688 allows this.

&gt;<i>  * With `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` we can make the C-side signature
</I>&gt;<i>  `SIGHASH_NOINPUT|SIGHASH_SINGLE` and allow B to re-sign the B-side
</I>&gt;<i>  signature for a higher-fee version of HTLC-Timeout (assuming my cached
</I>&gt;<i>  understanding of `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` still holds).
</I>
no_input isn't needed. With simply single+anyone can pay, then B can attach
a new input+output pair to increase the fees on their HTLC redemption
transaction. As you mention, they now enter into a race against this
malicious ndoe to bump up their fees in order to win over the other party.

If the malicious node uses a non-RBF signalled transaction to sweep their
HTLC, then we enter into another level of race, but this time on the mempool
propagation level. However, if there exists a relay path to a miner running
full RBF, then B's higher fee rate spend will win over.

&gt;<i> Good morning Matt, and list,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     RBF Pinning HTLC Transactions (aka &quot;Oh, wait, I can steal funds,
</I>&gt;<i> how, now?&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     =============================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     You'll note that in the discussion of RBF pinning we were pretty
</I>&gt;<i> broad, and that that discussion seems to in fact cover
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     our HTLC outputs, at least when spent via (3) or (4). It does, and
</I>&gt;<i> in fact this is a pretty severe issue in today's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     lightning protocol [2]. A lightning counterparty (C, who received
</I>&gt;<i> the HTLC from B, who received it from A) today could,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     if B broadcasts the commitment transaction, spend an HTLC using the
</I>&gt;<i> preimage with a low-fee, RBF-disabled transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     After a few blocks, A could claim the HTLC from B via the timeout
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism, and then after a few days, C could get the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     HTLC-claiming transaction mined via some out-of-band agreement with
</I>&gt;<i> a small miner. This leaves B short the HTLC value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My (cached) understanding is that, since RBF is signalled using
</I>&gt;<i> `nSequence`, any `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` also automatically imposes the
</I>&gt;<i> requirement &quot;must be RBF-enabled&quot;, including `&lt;0&gt; OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`.
</I>&gt;<i> Adding that clause (2 bytes in witness if my math is correct) to the
</I>&gt;<i> hashlock branch may be sufficient to prevent C from making an RBF-disabled
</I>&gt;<i> transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then you mention out-of-band agreements with miners, which basically
</I>&gt;<i> means the transaction might not be in the mempool at all, in which case the
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerability is not really about RBF or relay, but sheer economics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The payment is A-&gt;B-&gt;C, and the HTLC A-&gt;B must have a larger timeout (L +
</I>&gt;<i> 1) than the HTLC B-&gt;C (L), in abstract non-block units.
</I>&gt;<i> The vulnerability you are describing means that the current time must now
</I>&gt;<i> be L + 1 or greater (&quot;A could claim the HTLC from B via the timeout
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism&quot;, meaning the A-&gt;B HTLC has timed out already).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, then the B-&gt;C transaction has already timed out in the past and can
</I>&gt;<i> be claimed in two ways, either via B timeout branch or C hashlock branch.
</I>&gt;<i> This sets up a game where B and C bid to miners to get their version of
</I>&gt;<i> reality committed onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> (We can neglect out-of-band agreements here; miners have the incentive to
</I>&gt;<i> publicly leak such agreements so that other potential bidders can offer
</I>&gt;<i> even higher fees for their versions of that transaction.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before L+1, C has no incentive to bid, since placing any bid at all will
</I>&gt;<i> leak the preimage, which B can then turn around and use to spend from A,
</I>&gt;<i> and A and C cannot steal from B.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, B should ensure that *before* L+1, the HTLC-Timeout has been
</I>&gt;<i> committed onchain, which outright prevents this bidding war from even
</I>&gt;<i> starting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue then is that B is using a pre-signed HTLC-timeout, which is
</I>&gt;<i> needed since it is its commitment tx that was broadcast.
</I>&gt;<i> This prevents B from RBF-ing the HTLC-Timeout transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what is needed is to allow B to add fees to HTLC-Timeout:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * We can add an RBF carve-out output to HTLC-Timeout, at the cost of more
</I>&gt;<i> blockspace.
</I>&gt;<i> * With `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` we can make the C-side signature
</I>&gt;<i> `SIGHASH_NOINPUT|SIGHASH_SINGLE` and allow B to re-sign the B-side
</I>&gt;<i> signature for a higher-fee version of HTLC-Timeout (assuming my cached
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` still holds).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With this, B can exponentially increase the fee as L+1 approaches.
</I>&gt;<i> If B can get HTLC-Timeout confirmed before L+1, then C cannot steal the
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC value at all, since the UTXO it could steal from has already been
</I>&gt;<i> spent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, it does not seem to me that it is necessary to change the
</I>&gt;<i> hashlock-branch transaction of C at all, since this mechanism is enough to
</I>&gt;<i> sidestep the issue (as I understand it).
</I>&gt;<i> But it does point to a need to make HTLC-Timeout (and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> symmetrically, HTLC-Success) also fee-bumpable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note as well that this does not require a mempool: B can run in
</I>&gt;<i> `blocksonly` mode and as each block comes in from L to L+1, if HTLC-Timeout
</I>&gt;<i> is not confirmed, feebump HTLC-Timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, HTLC-Timeout comes into play only if B broadcast its own
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction, and B *should* be aware that it did so --- there is
</I>&gt;<i> still no need for mempool monitoring here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, of course this only delays the war.
</I>&gt;<i> Let us now consider what C can do to ensure that the bidding war will
</I>&gt;<i> happen eventually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * C can bribe a miner to prevent HTLC-Timeout from confirming between L
</I>&gt;<i> and L+1.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Or in other words, this is a censorship attack.
</I>&gt;<i>     * The Bitcoin censorship-resistance model is that censored
</I>&gt;<i> transactions can be fee-bumped, which attracts non-censoring miners to try
</I>&gt;<i> their luck at mining and evict the censoring miner.
</I>&gt;<i>       * Thus, letting B bump the fee on HTLC-Timeout is precisely the
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism we need.
</I>&gt;<i>       * This sets up a bidding war between C requesting miners to censor,
</I>&gt;<i> vs. B requesting miners to confirm, but that only sets the stage for a
</I>&gt;<i> second bidding war later between C and B, thus C is at a disadvantage: it
</I>&gt;<i> has to bribe miners to censor continuously from L to L+1 *and* additional
</I>&gt;<i> bribe miners to confirm its transaction after L+1, whereas B can offer its
</I>&gt;<i> bribe as being something that miners can claim now without waiting after
</I>&gt;<i> L+1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue of course is the additional output that bloats the UTXO set and
</I>&gt;<i> requires another transaction to claim later.
</I>&gt;<i> And if we have `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, it seems to me that
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun sidesteps this issue as well, as any timed-out
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC can be claimed with a fee-bumpable transaction directly without
</I>&gt;<i> RBF-carve-out.
</I>&gt;<i> (As well, it seems to me that, if both nodes support doing so, a
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja channel can be upgraded, without onchain activity, to a
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channel: sign a transaction spending the funding
</I>&gt;<i> tx to a txo that has been set up as Decker-Russell-Osuntokun, do not
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast that transaction, then revoke the latest Poon-Dryja commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transactions, then switch the mechanism over to Decker-Russell-Osuntokun;
</I>&gt;<i> you still need to monitor for previous Poon-Dryja commitment transactions,
</I>&gt;<i> but HTLCs now sidestep the issue under discussion here.)
</I>&gt;<i>
