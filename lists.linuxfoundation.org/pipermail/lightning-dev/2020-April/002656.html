Indeed, that is what I&#8217;m suggesting. Anchor output and all. One thing we could think about is only turning it on over a certain threshold, and having a separate &#8220;only-kinda-enforceable-on-chain-HTLC-in-flight&#8221; limit.

&gt;<i> Also see my mail elsewhere in the thread that the other party is actually
</I>&gt;<i> forced to spend their HTLC output using an RBF-replaceable transaction. With
</I>&gt;<i> that, I think we're all good here? In the end both sides have the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> raise the fee rate of their spending transactions with the highest winning.
</I>&gt;<i> As long as one of them confirms within the CLTV-delta, then everyone is
</I>&gt;<i> made whole.
</I>
It does seem like my cached recollection of RBF opt-in was incorrect but please re-read the intro email. There are a bunch of ways of doing pinning - just opting into RBF isn&#8217;t even close to enough.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Matt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; While this is somewhat unintuitive, there are any number of good anti-DoS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reasons for this, eg:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; None of these really strikes me as &quot;good&quot; reasons for this limitation, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is at the root of this issue, and will also plague any more complex Bitcoin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; contracts which rely on nested trees of transaction to confirm (CTV, Duplex,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channel factories, etc). Regarding the various (seemingly arbitrary) package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; limits it's likely the case that any issues w.r.t computational complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that may arise when trying to calculate evictions can be ameliorated with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; better choice of internal data structures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In the end, the simplest heuristic (accept the higher fee rate package) side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; steps all these issues and is also the most economically rationale from a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; miner's perspective. Why would one prefer a higher absolute fee package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (which could be very large) over another package with a higher total _fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; rate_?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seems like a somewhat unnecessary drive-by insult of a project you don't contribute to, but feel free to start with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a concrete suggestion here :).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You'll note that B would be just fine if they had a way to safely monitor the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; global mempool, and while this seems like a prudent mitigation for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lightning implementations to deploy today, it is itself a quagmire of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is it really all that complex? Assuming we're talking about just watching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for a certain script template (the HTLC scipt) in the mempool to be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pull a pre-image as soon as possible. Early versions of lnd used the mempool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for commitment broadcast detection (which turned out to be a bad idea so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; removed it), but at a glance I don't see why watching the mempool is so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; complex.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because watching your own mempool is not guaranteed to work, and during upgrade cycles that include changes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policy rules an attacker could exploit your upgraded/non-upgraded status to perform the same attack.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Further, this is a really obnoxious assumption to hoist onto lightning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; nodes - having an active full node with an in-sync mempool is a lot more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; CPU, bandwidth, and complexity than most lightning users were expecting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; face.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This would only be a requirement for Lightning nodes that seek to be a part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of the public routing network with a desire to _forward_ HTLCs. This isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't affect laptops or mobile phones which likely mostly have private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channels and don't participate in HTLC forwarding. I think it's pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable to expect a &quot;proper&quot; routing node on the network to be backed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a full-node. The bandwidth concern is valid, but we'd need concrete numbers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that compare the bandwidth over head of mempool awareness (assuming the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; latest and greatest mempool syncing) compared with the overhead of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channel update gossip and gossip queries over head which LN nodes face today
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; as is to see how much worse off they really would be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If mempool-watching were practical, maybe, though there are a number of folks who are talking about designing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partially-offline local lightning hubs which would be rendered impractical.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As detailed a bit below, if nodes watch the mempool, then this class of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attack assuming the anchor output format as described in the open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; lightning-rfc PR is mitigated. At a glance, watching the mempool seems like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a far less involved process compared to modifying the state machine as its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; defined today. By watching the mempool and implementing the changes in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; #lightning-rfc/688, then this issue can be mitigated _today_. lnd 0.10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't yet watch the mempool (but does include anchors [1]), but unless I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; missing something it should be pretty straight forward to add which mor or less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; resolves this issue all together.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not fixing this issue seems to render the whole exercise somewhat useless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Depends on if one considers watching the mempool a fix. But even with that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; base version of anchors still resolves a number of issues including:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; eliminating the commitment fee guessing game, allowing users to pay less on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; force close, being able to coalesce 2nd level HTLC transactions with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; same CLTV expiry, and actually being able to reliably enforce multi-hop HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; resolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Instead of making the HTLC output spending more free-form with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; SIGHASH_ANYONECAN_PAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE, we clearly need to go the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; direction - all HTLC output spends need to be pre-signed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure this is actually immediately workable (need to think about it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; more). To see why, remember that the commit_sig message includes HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; signatures for the _remote_ party's commitment transaction, so they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; spend the HTLCs if they broadcast their version of the commitment (force
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; close). If we don't somehow also _gain_ signatures (our new HTLC signatures)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; allowing us to spend HTLCs on _their_ version of the commitment, then if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they broadcast that commitment (without revoking), then we're unable to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; redeem any of those HTLCs at all, possibly losing money.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, maybe the proposal wasn't clear. The idea isn't to add signatures to braodcasted transactions, but instead to CPFP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a maybe-broadcasted transaction by sending a transaction which spends it and seeing if it is accepted. You only need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know the transaction's exact format (ie txid, which we do, since we sent a signature for it long ago) to do this, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't have to actually *have* the fully-signed transaction (and you don't).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In an attempt to counteract this, we might say ok, the revoke message also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; now includes HTLC signatures for their new commitment allowing us to spend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; our HTLCs. This resolves things in a weaker security model, but doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; address the issue generally, as after they receive the commit_sig, they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; broadcast immediately, again leaving us without a way to redeem our HTLCs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'd need to think about it more, but it seems that following this path would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; require an overhaul in the channel state machine to make presenting a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; commitment actually take at least _two phases_ (at least a full round trip).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The first phase would tender the commitment, but render them unable to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; broadcast it. The second phase would then &lt;insert something something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; scriptless scripts here&gt; enter a new sub-protocol which upon conclusion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; gives the commitment proposer valid HTLC signatures, and gives the responder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what they need to be able to broadcast their commitment and claim their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; HTCLs in an atomic manner.
