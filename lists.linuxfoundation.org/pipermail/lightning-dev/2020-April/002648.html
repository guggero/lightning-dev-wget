This seems like a somewhat unnecessary drive-by insult of a project you don't contribute to, but feel free to start with
a concrete suggestion here :).

&gt;&gt;<i> You'll note that B would be just fine if they had a way to safely monitor the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global mempool, and while this seems like a prudent mitigation for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightning implementations to deploy today, it is itself a quagmire of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it really all that complex? Assuming we're talking about just watching

</I>&gt;<i> pull a pre-image as soon as possible. Early versions of lnd used the mempool
</I>&gt;<i> for commitment broadcast detection (which turned out to be a bad idea so we
</I>&gt;<i> removed it), but at a glance I don't see why watching the mempool is so
</I>&gt;<i> complex.
</I>
Because watching your own mempool is not guaranteed to work, and during upgrade cycles that include changes to the
policy rules an attacker could exploit your upgraded/non-upgraded status to perform the same attack.

&gt;&gt;<i> Further, this is a really obnoxious assumption to hoist onto lightning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes - having an active full node with an in-sync mempool is a lot more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPU, bandwidth, and complexity than most lightning users were expecting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> face.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would only be a requirement for Lightning nodes that seek to be a part
</I>&gt;<i> of the public routing network with a desire to _forward_ HTLCs. This isn't
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't affect laptops or mobile phones which likely mostly have private
</I>&gt;<i> channels and don't participate in HTLC forwarding. I think it's pretty
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to expect a &quot;proper&quot; routing node on the network to be backed by
</I>&gt;<i> a full-node. The bandwidth concern is valid, but we'd need concrete numbers
</I>&gt;<i> that compare the bandwidth over head of mempool awareness (assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> latest and greatest mempool syncing) compared with the overhead of the
</I>&gt;<i> channel update gossip and gossip queries over head which LN nodes face today
</I>&gt;<i> as is to see how much worse off they really would be.
</I>
If mempool-watching were practical, maybe, though there are a number of folks who are talking about designing
partially-offline local lightning hubs which would be rendered impractical.

&gt;<i> As detailed a bit below, if nodes watch the mempool, then this class of
</I>&gt;<i> attack assuming the anchor output format as described in the open
</I>&gt;<i> lightning-rfc PR is mitigated. At a glance, watching the mempool seems like
</I>&gt;<i> a far less involved process compared to modifying the state machine as its
</I>&gt;<i> defined today. By watching the mempool and implementing the changes in
</I>&gt;<i> #lightning-rfc/688, then this issue can be mitigated _today_. lnd 0.10
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't yet watch the mempool (but does include anchors [1]), but unless I'm
</I>&gt;<i> missing something it should be pretty straight forward to add which mor or less
</I>&gt;<i> resolves this issue all together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not fixing this issue seems to render the whole exercise somewhat useless
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Depends on if one considers watching the mempool a fix. But even with that a
</I>&gt;<i> base version of anchors still resolves a number of issues including:
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating the commitment fee guessing game, allowing users to pay less on
</I>&gt;<i> force close, being able to coalesce 2nd level HTLC transactions with the
</I>&gt;<i> same CLTV expiry, and actually being able to reliably enforce multi-hop HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> resolution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead of making the HTLC output spending more free-form with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SIGHASH_ANYONECAN_PAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE, we clearly need to go the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direction - all HTLC output spends need to be pre-signed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure this is actually immediately workable (need to think about it
</I>&gt;<i> more). To see why, remember that the commit_sig message includes HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> signatures for the _remote_ party's commitment transaction, so they can
</I>&gt;<i> spend the HTLCs if they broadcast their version of the commitment (force
</I>&gt;<i> close). If we don't somehow also _gain_ signatures (our new HTLC signatures)
</I>&gt;<i> allowing us to spend HTLCs on _their_ version of the commitment, then if
</I>&gt;<i> they broadcast that commitment (without revoking), then we're unable to
</I>&gt;<i> redeem any of those HTLCs at all, possibly losing money.
</I>
Hmm, maybe the proposal wasn't clear. The idea isn't to add signatures to braodcasted transactions, but instead to CPFP
a maybe-broadcasted transaction by sending a transaction which spends it and seeing if it is accepted. You only need to
know the transaction's exact format (ie txid, which we do, since we sent a signature for it long ago) to do this, you
don't have to actually *have* the fully-signed transaction (and you don't).

&gt;<i> In an attempt to counteract this, we might say ok, the revoke message also
</I>&gt;<i> now includes HTLC signatures for their new commitment allowing us to spend
</I>&gt;<i> our HTLCs. This resolves things in a weaker security model, but doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> address the issue generally, as after they receive the commit_sig, they can
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast immediately, again leaving us without a way to redeem our HTLCs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd need to think about it more, but it seems that following this path would
</I>&gt;<i> require an overhaul in the channel state machine to make presenting a new
</I>&gt;<i> commitment actually take at least _two phases_ (at least a full round trip).
</I>&gt;<i> The first phase would tender the commitment, but render them unable to
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast it. The second phase would then &lt;insert something something
</I>&gt;<i> scriptless scripts here&gt; enter a new sub-protocol which upon conclusion,
</I>&gt;<i> gives the commitment proposer valid HTLC signatures, and gives the responder
</I>&gt;<i> what they need to be able to broadcast their commitment and claim their
</I>&gt;<i> HTCLs in an atomic manner.
