Indeed, a few hundred sats isn't likely worth arguing about :)

&gt;<i> On the topic of UTXO bloat, IMO re-purposing the to_remote output as an
</I>&gt;<i> anchor is arguably _worse_, as only a single party in the channel is able to
</I>&gt;<i> spend that output in order to remove its impact on the UTXO set. On the
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, using two anchors (with their special scripts) allows _anyone_
</I>&gt;<i> to sweep these outputs several blocks after the commitment transaction has
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed. In order to cover the case where the remote party has no balance,
</I>&gt;<i> but a single incoming HTLC, the channel initiator must either create a new
</I>&gt;<i> anchor output for this special case (creating a new type of ad-hoc reserve),
</I>&gt;<i> or always create a to_remote output for the other party (donating the 330
</I>&gt;<i> satoshis).
</I>
This seems like a straw-man. Going from 1 anyone-spendable + 1 such UTXO to 2 anyone-spendable UTXOs + 1 such UTXO does not seem like a
decrease to me. If you really want to nitpick, I have zero issue with having the to_remote+anchor revert to an anyone-can-spend form if it
is of dust value. This may be a bit complicated for others, but with our new onchain stuff, it would be rather trivial for us to deal with.

&gt;<i> The first option reduces down to having two anchors once again,
</I>&gt;<i> while the second option creates an output which is likely uneconomical to
</I>&gt;<i> sweep in isolation (compared to anchors which can be swept globally in the
</I>&gt;<i> system taking advantage of the input aggregation savings).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The final factor to consider is if we wish to properly re-introduce a CSV
</I>&gt;<i> delay to the to_remote party in an attempt to remedy some game theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> issues w.r.t forcing one party to close early without a cost to the
</I>&gt;<i> instigator. In the past we made some headway in this direction, but then

</I>&gt;<i> leave this thread open to a comprehensive solution, as the dual anchor
</I>&gt;<i> format is fully decoupled from the rest of the commitment.
</I>
If we want to deploy an upgrade, the commitment transaction format will change. Lets not get excited about reducing the diff in such a
change for its own sake - the vast majority of the effort is the upgrade, not the diff of having an extra anchor.
