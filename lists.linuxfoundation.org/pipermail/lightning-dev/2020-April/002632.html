<PRE>&quot; C cannot unlock until 144 blocks, so D can delay its response for up to
143 blocks without any effect on its channels, this is *exactly* the
griefing attack.&quot;- Is there any way to account for the amount of time
elapsed in the redeem script so that when D goes on chain just before
elapse of the locktime, a decision can be enforced like &quot;do not pay the
full amount to D because of the response delay &quot;?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Introduction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ============
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given the fact that contracts on offchain protocols need to be
</I>&gt;<i> enforceable onchain as well, timelocks involved in multi-hop payments are
</I>&gt;<i> measured in blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is because the blockchain can only (third-party-verifiably)
</I>&gt;<i> enforce timeouts in units of entire blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This leads to very long timeouts for payment delivery, thus
</I>&gt;<i> multi-hop offchain payment attempts can be, deliberately or accidentally,
</I>&gt;<i> be in a &quot;pending&quot; state up to the very large timeouts involved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deliberately setting up a multi-hop payment such that it will be
</I>&gt;<i> in a &quot;pending&quot; state for long periods of time is colloquially known as a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;griefing attack&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this article, we assess various proposed solutions to mitigate
</I>&gt;<i> the effects of griefing attacks, and propose a particular solution,
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-closure, as well, that requires significant changes to the update
</I>&gt;<i> state machine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Digression: Why Grief?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ======================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Before embarking on our investigation for solutions to the
</I>&gt;<i> griefing problem, we should first wonder if griefing is, in fact, a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This brings up the question of: why would anybody grief at all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Humans, like cats and other less-sapient pieces of walking meat,
</I>&gt;<i> often find enjoyment in causing the suffering of others for no immediate
</I>&gt;<i> direct gain to themselves, as a public demonstration of dominance over
</I>&gt;<i> those they make suffer (aka &quot;shits and giggles&quot;, which, if executed
</I>&gt;<i> correctly, can lead to eventual direct gains to themselves or their progeny
</I>&gt;<i> or relatives or allies, but such details are often outside the ken of the
</I>&gt;<i> very beings who execute such survival strategies: brains are pieces of meat
</I>&gt;<i> that have been hacked to act as action-reaction engines, but are not
</I>&gt;<i> sophisticated enough to execute as pure rationality engines at all times).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately, in the Bitcoin world, only purely rational beings of
</I>&gt;<i> pure selfishness can exist in the long run, thus we can neglect such
</I>&gt;<i> motivations as mere noise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, let us investigate *how* griefing attacks can be performed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * An intermediate node in a multi-hop attempt can delay forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> or failing an incoming HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A final node in a payment attempt can delay claiming an incoming
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us consider a purely rational intermediate node of pure
</I>&gt;<i> selfishness:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * If it forwards as soon as possible, it can earn fees, and also
</I>&gt;<i> speed up the release of the HTLC-locked funds so that they can reuse those
</I>&gt;<i> funds as liquidity for further payment attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Thus, delaying an HTLC is not selfishly-rational for an
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, for an intermediate node, it seems there is no
</I>&gt;<i> selfishly-rational motivation to execute a griefing attack on an arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> payment attempt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can then conclude that an intermediate that delays a payment
</I>&gt;<i> would do so, not of its own rational self-interest, but as an accident,
</I>&gt;<i> such as an unforeseen connectivity or power failure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, things are different when we consider a non-arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose a node were to make a payment attempt to itself, and
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately delay claiming this self-payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This lets any single node, *who happens to own large liquidity*,
</I>&gt;<i> to lock up the liquidity of other nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The motivation to lock up the liquidity of other nodes is to
</I>&gt;<i> *eliminate competition*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose we have a network as below:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     A -- B -- C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       \     /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;        \   /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         \ /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          E
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When A and C want to transact with one another, they may choose to
</I>&gt;<i> route via either B or E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B and E are therefore competitors in the business of forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> payments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But suppose E has much larger channels AE and CE than the channels
</I>&gt;<i> of AB and CB.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, suppose E has 100mBTC perfectly-balanced channels
</I>&gt;<i> while B has only 10mBTC perfectly-balanced channels, as all things should
</I>&gt;<i> be in simplified models of reality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E can then &quot;take out the competition&quot; by making a 5mBTC
</I>&gt;<i> self-payment along E-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;E and a 5mBTC self-payment along
</I>&gt;<i> E-&gt;C-&gt;B-&gt;A-&gt;E, then refusing to claim the payment, tying up all the
</I>&gt;<i> liquidity of the channels of B.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By doing so, it can ensure that A and C will always fail to pay
</I>&gt;<i> via B, even if they wish to transact in amounts less than 5mBTC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E thereby eliminates B as a competitor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This demonstrates that griefing attacks will be motivated, such
</I>&gt;<i> that such attacks will be performed by payers and payees *against
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Intermediate nodes have no motivation to attack payers and payees
</I>&gt;<i> (those are their potential customers in the business of forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> payments, and attacking potential customers is bad business: such attacking
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes will be removed economically in the long run).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, payers and payees can become motivated to attack
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes, if the &quot;payer&quot; and &quot;payee&quot; are actually competitor
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (We can observe that this is always a possibility even outside of
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning: a service or product provider has no incentive to attack its
</I>&gt;<i> customers (&quot;the customer is always right&quot;), but have an incentive to
</I>&gt;<i> *pretend* to be a customer of a competitor and attack them.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We will keep this fact in mind: active griefing attacks are
</I>&gt;<i> attacks *on* intermediate nodes, not *by* intermediate nodes, because there
</I>&gt;<i> is no economic incentive for intermediate nodes to attack their customers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Previous Proposed Solutions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ===========================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time-Spent Reporting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At each channel along the route, the time spent by a node to
</I>&gt;<i> handle its forwarding is recorded, and reported upstream in the route.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this solution protects payers from intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> nodes and payees: it does not protect intermediate nodes from colluding
</I>&gt;<i> payers and payees.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if an intermediate node knows that a particular node is
</I>&gt;<i> consistently slow via a previous time-spent report, it will not be able,
</I>&gt;<i> with our current onion routing, determine if an onion packet it just
</I>&gt;<i> received will or will not go through the known-slow node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, an intermediate node would not be able to defend against
</I>&gt;<i> distant payees that, with a colluding payer, will not claim a particular
</I>&gt;<i> payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we have established, an active griefing atttack will never be
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately performed by a selfishly-rational intermediate node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, this solution protects against the wrong thing: it protects
</I>&gt;<i> payers against slow/unreliable intermediate nodes, it does not protect
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate nodes against malicious payer/payee collusions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It protects only against intermediate nodes that inadvertently go
</I>&gt;<i> offline during forwarding, but such nodes will inevitably lose out on the
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding market anyway, and will disappear in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Up-Front Payment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Payers pay for an attempt, not just the successful completion of
</I>&gt;<i> an attempt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A variation on this is that the payer (or payee) continuously pays
</I>&gt;<i> as long as the payment is pending.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further variations include paying by other means, such as just
</I>&gt;<i> locking funds or paying with proof-of-work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While it certainly erects economic barriers against payer/payee
</I>&gt;<i> collusions attacking intermediate nodes, it *also* erects economic barriers
</I>&gt;<i> against normal, non-malicious payments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can consider that economic barriers against non-malicious,
</I>&gt;<i> low-value, high-frequency payments (&quot;micropayments&quot;) may be enough that
</I>&gt;<i> such payments become infeasible if we impose up-front payment for mere
</I>&gt;<i> attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, while this solution is certainly something we can consider,
</I>&gt;<i> we must be reluctant to use it due to its up-front, strict-evaluation
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Proof-Of-Closure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Observing the above, we want the properties for a &quot;good&quot; solution
</I>&gt;<i> to griefing attacks to be:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * It should protect intermediate nodes against payer/payee
</I>&gt;<i> collusions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * It should only come into play upon detection of an attack.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We now present proof-of-closure, which (we hope) has the above
</I>&gt;<i> properties.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can consider instead a softer timeout, distinct from the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> block-based timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This softer timeout is measurable in fractions of a second, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> units of 0.1 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each node on the network advertises, in addition to a block-based
</I>&gt;<i> `cltv_delta`, a `timeout_delta` in units of 0.1 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, each invoice contains, in addition to a block-based
</I>&gt;<i> `final_cltv`, a `final_timeout` in units of 0.1 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, there are two timeouts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * The current &quot;hard&quot; block-based timeout that is enforceable
</I>&gt;<i> onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A new &quot;soft&quot; sidereal-time-based timeout that is not onchain
</I>&gt;<i> enforceable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The soft timeout, as mentioned, is not enforceable onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, enforcement of the soft timeout *is* the act of putting
</I>&gt;<i> the channel state onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, for the current &quot;hard&quot; block-based timeout, we already have a
</I>&gt;<i> reaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the HTLC &quot;hard&quot; timeout is approaching:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Drop the channel onchain and enforce the hard timeout onchain to
</I>&gt;<i> reclaim the funds in the HTLCs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Wait for the onchain action to be deeply resolved (either
</I>&gt;<i> timelock or hashlock branch is confirmed deeply) and report the result
</I>&gt;<i> (success or fail) upstream.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What happens if the &quot;soft&quot; timeout is violated?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Drop the channel onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Report the channel closure upstream.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot;hard&quot; timeout is cancelled in any of these two conditions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A success is reported via `update_fulfill_htlc`, OR,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A failure is reported via `update_fail_htlc` AND the HTLC is
</I>&gt;<i> irrevocably removed from the latest commitments/state(s) of the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot;soft&quot; timeout is cancelled in any of these three conditions,
</I>&gt;<i> the first two of which are the same as above:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A success is reported via `update_fulfill_htlc`, OR,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A failure is reported via `update_fail_htlc` AND the HTLC is
</I>&gt;<i> irrevocably removed from the latest commitments/state(s) of the channel, OR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A channel closure is reported.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us fill this in more detail.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose we have a payment route A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Both the &quot;hard&quot; block timeouts and the &quot;soft&quot; second timeouts
</I>&gt;<i> decrement monotonically at each hop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the payee E has the shortest &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; timeouts (as
</I>&gt;<i> normal).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Suppose E then delays claiming the payment and violates the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;soft&quot; timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * C then drops the CE channel onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * C reports, before its own timeout (slightly larger than the
</I>&gt;<i> timeout imposed on E), the closing of the channel CE, to B.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * B validates this report, and if valid, propagates the report to
</I>&gt;<i> A.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * A validates this report, and if valid, accepts that the payment
</I>&gt;<i> will be &quot;stuck&quot; for up to the hard timeout it imposed on B.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C has to report back to B in order to prevent B from closing the
</I>&gt;<i> BC channel, and B has to report back to A in order to prevent A from
</I>&gt;<i> closing the AB channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The decrementing seconds-unit timeouts are needed for each hop,
</I>&gt;<i> for the same reason that decrementing block-unit timeouts are needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since E is motivated to attack intermediate nodes because it wants
</I>&gt;<i> to redirect payment forwards through itself rather than its competitotrs,
</I>&gt;<i> having one of its channels closed (which prevents it from being used for
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding) is directly opposed to its end goal of getting more money,
</I>&gt;<i> thus, we can believe the action of closing a channel involved in a griefing
</I>&gt;<i> attack is sufficient disincentive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The major drawback is that enforcement of the soft timeout *is* a
</I>&gt;<i> channel closure, which is generally a negative for the network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not a remote attack vector, since a node can only trigger
</I>&gt;<i> this closure if it is able to stall the fulfillment or failure of an HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> on a channel, which generally means the node triggering this closure can
</I>&gt;<i> only do so for its own channels (or it is able to, via a separate
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism, remotely crash a different node).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Proving Channel Closes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What C *really* needs to prove is that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * It is *willing* to close a channel due to a violation of the
</I>&gt;<i> soft timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * The channel it is willing to close was, in fact, involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> same payment attempt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the above, B can believe that C was innocent of wrongdoing,
</I>&gt;<i> because:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * C would only be wiling to close a channel in case of a protocol
</I>&gt;<i> violation, in this case, a violation of the soft timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * The channel it closed was closed because of this payment
</I>&gt;<i> attempt, and not because of another payment attempt, or some other
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated channel being unilaterally closed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, what C needs to prove is *NOT*, in fact, actual channel
</I>&gt;<i> closure: it needs to prove a *willingness* to close a channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, it does not require the channel to actually be *closed* yet,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. it does not have to wait for onchain activity that the channel closure
</I>&gt;<i> is in a mempool and is confirmed deeply onchain etc etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, to prove a *willingness to close* rather than an actual
</I>&gt;<i> close, C can provide the unilateral close of the channel CE.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The act of unilaterally closing a channel is the publication of
</I>&gt;<i> the transaction(s) making up the unilateral close.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, if C is *willing* to close the channel, it is willing to
</I>&gt;<i> publish the transaction(s) involved, and thus, providing the unilateral
</I>&gt;<i> close to B and further upstream, shows a willingness to close the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B then validates the provided proof-of-closure by checking that
</I>&gt;<i> the unilateral close transaction is either onchain, in the mempool, or that
</I>&gt;<i> it spends a TXO that is not currently spent by another transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case the unilateral close transaction is not confirmed and
</I>&gt;<i> in the mempool, B can speed up its propagation on the Bitcoin layer by
</I>&gt;<i> putting it in its own mempool as well --- after all, C is willing to close
</I>&gt;<i> the channel to exonerate itself and punish the actual culprit, and B
</I>&gt;<i> putting the unilateral close in its own mempool can only help C in what it
</I>&gt;<i> is willing to do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, C needs to prove that the channel it is willing to close
</I>&gt;<i> involves the payment attempt, and is not some other channel closure that it
</I>&gt;<i> is attempting to use to fulfill its own soft timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the unilateral close transaction *is* the proof-of-closure,
</I>&gt;<i> B (and A) can inspect the transaction outputs and see (with some additional
</I>&gt;<i> data from C) that one of the outputs is to an HTLC that matches the payment
</I>&gt;<i> hash.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, B (and A) can believe that the proof-of-closure proves that
</I>&gt;<i> whoever is presenting it is free of wrongdoing, as whoever is actually
</I>&gt;<i> causing the delay has been punished (by someone being willing to close a
</I>&gt;<i> channel with the culprit), and that the proof-of-closure commits to this
</I>&gt;<i> particular payment attempt and no other (because it commits to a particular
</I>&gt;<i> payment hash).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, if CE is closed by E dropping it onchain rather than C, C
</I>&gt;<i> will still be able to fulfill its own soft timeout by taking the closing
</I>&gt;<i> transaction from E, which should still contain the HTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed, neither A nor B will particularly care (nor need to know)
</I>&gt;<i> who dropped the channel onchain, or (for A) that the channel participants
</I>&gt;<i> are C and E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Update State Shenanigans
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bitcoin update mechanisms are complicated things, and it may be
</I>&gt;<i> possible for an attacking payee E to fool around with the update state
</I>&gt;<i> machine to make it difficult for C to report a willingness to close CE.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In particular, I quote here the relevant passages from
</I>&gt;<i> `lightning-rfc`, `02-peer-protocol.md`, which is an implementation of the
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja update mechanism:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus each update traverses through the following states:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. pending on the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. in the receiver's latest commitment transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. ... and the receiver's previous commitment transaction has
</I>&gt;<i> been revoked,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    and the update is pending on the sender
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. ... and in the sender's latest commitment transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. ... and the sender's previous commitment transaction has been
</I>&gt;<i> revoked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The payee E is the &quot;receiver&quot; in this context.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this case, once the update has reached step 2, then E has a
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction that it can put onchain, that contains an HTLC it
</I>&gt;<i> can claim.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From this step onward, C cannot send a failure (i.e. it cannot
</I>&gt;<i> send back an `update_fail_htlc`) back to B, because E could drop its latest
</I>&gt;<i> commitment onchain and claim the HTLC onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, until step 4, C does not have a unilateral close
</I>&gt;<i> containing the HTLC, and thus cannot provide a proof-of-closure that
</I>&gt;<i> contains an HTLC that refers to the payment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, between steps 2 to 4, C cannot safely respond to its own
</I>&gt;<i> soft timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C cannot respond with a failure, as E could then drop its latest
</I>&gt;<i> commitment transaction onchain and claim the payment from C, and extract
</I>&gt;<i> money from C that way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C also cannot respond with a proof-of-closure, as it does not have
</I>&gt;<i> a transaction that it can use to provide this proof.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The best that C can do would be to impose an even shorter timeout
</I>&gt;<i> between steps 2 and 4 above, and to drop its current commitment transaction
</I>&gt;<i> (which does not contain the HTLC yet and thus does not constitute a valid
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-closure) onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In between the time it drops the commitment transaction and its
</I>&gt;<i> own incoming soft timeout, there is a chance, however small, that this
</I>&gt;<i> transaction will be confirmed, and the channel will (with high probability)
</I>&gt;<i> settle in a state where the HTLC is not instantiated, thus C can safely
</I>&gt;<i> fail its incoming HTLC (not show a proof-of-closure, since that is not
</I>&gt;<i> possible for C to do) without risk of loss, just prior to its own soft
</I>&gt;<i> timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, C is still at risk here: E could collude with miners
</I>&gt;<i> via a side-channel fee offer to confirm its commitment transaction with the
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC present, and ensure that C is liable for the HTLC value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With Decker-Russell-Osuntokun, we can remove this risk by
</I>&gt;<i> requiring a ritual as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  C requests exclusive access to update their single shared
</I>&gt;<i> state.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * This can be done via a variety of sub-protocols, including a
</I>&gt;<i> fair coin toss in case of near-simultaneous requests for exclusive locks on
</I>&gt;<i> both sides.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  C provides the details of the new HTLC to E.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.  C and E generate the new state transaction and exchange
</I>&gt;<i> signatures for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4.  C and E generate (without signing) the new update transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5.  E provides the signature (or share of signature, if MuSig) for
</I>&gt;<i> the new update transaction to C.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6.  C provides the signature for the new update transaction to E,
</I>&gt;<i> which releases the exclusive lock on the shared state atomically with the
</I>&gt;<i> finalization of the new update transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prior to step 5, C can simply fail the incoming HTLC from B in
</I>&gt;<i> case its own soft timeout is near.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if E performs step 5 after C has already failed the incoming
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC from B, C can simply not perform step 6 and drop the channel onchain
</I>&gt;<i> with the previous update and state transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With Poon-Dryja, we will have to rearrange the order in which we
</I>&gt;<i> perform things, effectively adding an extra communications turnaround
</I>&gt;<i> between the participants.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specifically, the order would have to be revised to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. pending on the sender
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. in the sender's latest commitment transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. ... and the sender's previous commitment transaction has been
</I>&gt;<i> revoked,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    and the update is pending on the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. ... and in the receiver's latest commitment transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. ... and the receiver's previous commitment transaction has
</I>&gt;<i> been revoked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This allows the sender (C in our context) to provide a
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-closure after step 2, and before step 2, C can safely return a
</I>&gt;<i> failure with `update_fail_htlc` (and refuse to proceed beyond step 2, thus
</I>&gt;<i> ensuring it can still use the previous commitment that still has no HTLC).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, this change will require redesigning the update state
</I>&gt;<i> machine, increasing the number of communication turnarounds, and creating a
</I>&gt;<i> subtle incompatbility when transitioning a payment from a hop that knows
</I>&gt;<i> only the old update state machine to a hop that knows the new update state
</I>&gt;<i> machine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Purely Falsified Proof-Of-Closure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, the attacking node E might want to create a false
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-closure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E can do this by simulating a Lightning channel: lock an amount of
</I>&gt;<i> funds in a 2-of-2 (where E controls both keys), then spend it in a set of
</I>&gt;<i> transactions mimicking the unilateral close.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We observe, however, that the overhead of simulating a Lightning
</I>&gt;<i> channel is the same as the overhead of actually creating and closing a
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the punishment of proof-of-closure is to force attackers to
</I>&gt;<i> have their channels closed, we can consider that this simulation of a
</I>&gt;<i> channel open and close is sufficient as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Future-Proofing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This sketch of proof-of-closure can be used for any update
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * With Poon-Dryja, C can use its own commitment transaction as the
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-closure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * With Decker-Wattenhofer, C can give all the offchain
</I>&gt;<i> transactions up to the last stage in the multi-stage
</I>&gt;<i> decrementing-`nSequence` mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * With Deckker-Russell-Osuntokun, C can give the latest update and
</I>&gt;<i> state trnsaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, we expect that for now, and in the future, any update
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism worth consideration will have a concept of &quot;unilateral close&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> where a channel can be dropped onchain, using data that only one of the
</I>&gt;<i> channel participants holds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a unilateral close will be a sequence of one or more valid
</I>&gt;<i> transactions, terminating in a transaction containing an HTLC-like contract
</I>&gt;<i> in one of its outputs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, to validate the unilateral close, it is only required to
</I>&gt;<i> validate all the transactions contained in the proof-of-closure, and see
</I>&gt;<i> that the last transaction has an HTLC output.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The limitations are thus:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * The acceptable forms of HTLC would need to be agreed-upon by the
</I>&gt;<i> entire network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Implementations would need to be able to assess, in a
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin-consensus-compatible way, whether a transaction is valid or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Payment Decorrelation and Payment Points
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, having a single payment hash for the entire payment
</I>&gt;<i> attempt is a privacy loss, which we intend to fix in the near future by
</I>&gt;<i> using payment points, and adding a blinding scalar at each hop, aka.
</I>&gt;<i> payment decorrelation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, in the future, there will not be any HTLC, but instead a
</I>&gt;<i> PTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the payment point at each hop will be changed at each
</I>&gt;<i> hop, in order to prevent decorrelation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, C needs to provide proofs:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * That an apparent singlesig on the unilateral close output is in
</I>&gt;<i> fact a PTLC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   C needs to provide:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * A target point P.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * A partial signature that would spend that singlesig for a
</I>&gt;<i> particular sighash.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * An adaptor signature which, with knowledge of the completed
</I>&gt;<i> signature, adaptor signature, and sighash message, would have revealed the
</I>&gt;<i> scalar behind P.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * That the PTLC belongs to the same payment attempt as what B
</I>&gt;<i> offered to C.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   C needs to provide:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * The C-only blinding factor that is the difference between the
</I>&gt;<i> payment point of the B-to-C PTLC and the C-to-E PTLC on the unilateral
</I>&gt;<i> close.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, when B needs to propagate the proof-of-closure back to A, B
</I>&gt;<i> simply adds its own blinding factor to the reported blinding factor, in
</I>&gt;<i> order to convince A that this is the same payment attempt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we have brought up privacy, we observe that, when this
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism triggers, there is a mild privacy loss, in that intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> nodes now know some channel closure that is related to this payment, and
</I>&gt;<i> can thus determine the exact path that the payment attempt went through, at
</I>&gt;<i> least until the channel being closed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, proof-of-closure is only propagated in case of violation
</I>&gt;<i> of the soft timeout, so for normal non-malicious payments, proof-of-closure
</I>&gt;<i> does not cause any privacy loss.
