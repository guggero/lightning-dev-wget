<PRE>Commenting on it : &quot;As for ZmnSCPxj's suggestion, I think there is the same
kind of issue.
The secrets we establish with anonymous multi-hops locks are between the
*sender*
and each of the hops. In the route blinding case, what we're adding are
secrets
between the *recipient* and the hops, and we don't want the sender to be
able to
influence those.&quot;
Is it a good idea to rely entirely on the sender for sampling the secrets
as well as generating the PTLC? As happens in anonymous multi-hops locks,
for example. Or as it has been discussed later in the thread, both receiver
and sender must be involved in creation of PTLC? What happens if
sender/receiver is/(or both are) corrupted? Can it leak secrets to other
parties?

&gt;<i> Good morning list,

</I>&gt;<i> I certainly want this as well for wallet users' privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have gathered my proposal in a better format than my previous gist here:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will note that I've been able to simplify the scheme a bit compared to
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> gist. It's now very clear that this is exactly the same kind of secrets
</I>&gt;<i> derivation than what Sphinx does. I still have things I want to add to the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, but at least the crypto part should be ready to review (and I
</I>&gt;<i> think
</I>&gt;<i> it does need more eyes on it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to add comments directly on the branch commits, it may be easier
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> review that way. Let me know if you think I should turn it into a draft PR
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate discussions. It kept it vague on some specific parts on purpose
</I>&gt;<i> (such as invoice fields, encrypted blob format); we will learn from early
</I>&gt;<i> prototype implementations and enrich the proposal as we go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few comments on your previous mails. I have removed the (ab)use of
</I>&gt;<i> `payment_secret`, but I think your comment on using the `blinding` to
</I>&gt;<i> replace
</I>&gt;<i> it would not work because that blinding is known by the next-to-last node
</I>&gt;<i> (which computes it and forwards it to the final node).
</I>&gt;<i> The goal of `payment_secret` is explicitly to avoid having the
</I>&gt;<i> next-to-last node
</I>&gt;<i> discover it to prevent him from probing. But I think that you didn't plan
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> doing the blinding the same way I'm doing it, which may explain the
</I>&gt;<i> difference.

</I>&gt;<i> Le mer. 11 mars 2020 &#224; 00:22, Rusty Russell &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev">rusty at rustcorp.com.au</A>&gt; a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Good morning Rusty, et al.,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Note that this means no payment secret is necessary, since the incoming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; `blinding` serves the same purpose. If we wanted to, we could (ab)use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; payment_secret as the first 32-bytes to put in Carol's enc1 (i.e. it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the ECDH for Carol to decrypt enc1).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I confess to not reading everything in detail, but it seems to me that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with payment point + scalar and path decorrelation, we need to establish a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secret with each hop anyway (the blinding scalar for path decorrelation),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so if you need a secret per hop, possibly this could be reused as well?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed, this could be used the same way, though for that secret it can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply be placed inside the onion rather than passed alongside.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rusty.
