<PRE>&gt;<i> Indeed, that is what I&#8217;m suggesting
</I>
Gotcha, if this is indeed what you're suggesting (all HTLC spends are now
2-of-2 multi-sig), then I think the modifications to the state machine I
sketched out in an earlier email are required. An exact construction which
achieves the requirements of &quot;you can't broadcast until you have a secret
which I can obtain from the htlc sig for your commitment transaction, and my
secret is revealed with another swap&quot;, appears to be an open problem, atm.

Even if they're restricted in this fashion (must be a 1-in-1 out,
sighashall, fees are pre agreed upon), they can still spend that with a CPFP
(while still unconfirmed in the mempool) and create another heavy tree,
which puts us right back at the same bidding war scenario?

&gt;<i> There are a bunch of ways of doing pinning - just opting into RBF isn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> even close to enough.
</I>
Mhmm, there're other ways of doing pinning. But with anchors as is defined
in that spec PR, they're forced to spend with an RBF-replaceable
transaction, which means the party wishing to time things out can enter into
a bidding war. If the party trying to impeded things participates in this
progressive absolute fee increase, it's likely that the war terminates
with _one_ of them getting into the block, which seems to resolve
everything?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; None of these really strikes me as &quot;good&quot; reasons for this limitation,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; contracts which rely on nested trees of transaction to confirm (CTV,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Duplex,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channel factories, etc). Regarding the various (seemingly arbitrary)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; limits it's likely the case that any issues w.r.t computational
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that may arise when trying to calculate evictions can be ameliorated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; better choice of internal data structures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In the end, the simplest heuristic (accept the higher fee rate package)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; steps all these issues and is also the most economically rationale from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; miner's perspective. Why would one prefer a higher absolute fee package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (which could be very large) over another package with a higher total
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _fee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; rate_?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seems like a somewhat unnecessary drive-by insult of a project you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't contribute to, but feel free to start with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a concrete suggestion here :).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You'll note that B would be just fine if they had a way to safely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monitor the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; global mempool, and while this seems like a prudent mitigation for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lightning implementations to deploy today, it is itself a quagmire of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is it really all that complex? Assuming we're talking about just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for a certain script template (the HTLC scipt) in the mempool to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pull a pre-image as soon as possible. Early versions of lnd used the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mempool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for commitment broadcast detection (which turned out to be a bad idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; removed it), but at a glance I don't see why watching the mempool is so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; complex.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because watching your own mempool is not guaranteed to work, and during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upgrade cycles that include changes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policy rules an attacker could exploit your upgraded/non-upgraded status
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to perform the same attack.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Further, this is a really obnoxious assumption to hoist onto lightning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; nodes - having an active full node with an in-sync mempool is a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; CPU, bandwidth, and complexity than most lightning users were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expecting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; face.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This would only be a requirement for Lightning nodes that seek to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of the public routing network with a desire to _forward_ HTLCs. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't affect laptops or mobile phones which likely mostly have private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channels and don't participate in HTLC forwarding. I think it's pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable to expect a &quot;proper&quot; routing node on the network to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a full-node. The bandwidth concern is valid, but we'd need concrete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numbers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that compare the bandwidth over head of mempool awareness (assuming the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; latest and greatest mempool syncing) compared with the overhead of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; channel update gossip and gossip queries over head which LN nodes face
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> today
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; as is to see how much worse off they really would be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If mempool-watching were practical, maybe, though there are a number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folks who are talking about designing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partially-offline local lightning hubs which would be rendered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impractical.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As detailed a bit below, if nodes watch the mempool, then this class of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attack assuming the anchor output format as described in the open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; lightning-rfc PR is mitigated. At a glance, watching the mempool seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a far less involved process compared to modifying the state machine as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; defined today. By watching the mempool and implementing the changes in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; #lightning-rfc/688, then this issue can be mitigated _today_. lnd 0.10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't yet watch the mempool (but does include anchors [1]), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unless I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; missing something it should be pretty straight forward to add which mor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; resolves this issue all together.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not fixing this issue seems to render the whole exercise somewhat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Depends on if one considers watching the mempool a fix. But even with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; base version of anchors still resolves a number of issues including:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; eliminating the commitment fee guessing game, allowing users to pay
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; force close, being able to coalesce 2nd level HTLC transactions with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; same CLTV expiry, and actually being able to reliably enforce multi-hop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; resolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Instead of making the HTLC output spending more free-form with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; SIGHASH_ANYONECAN_PAY|SIGHASH_SINGLE, we clearly need to go the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; direction - all HTLC output spends need to be pre-signed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure this is actually immediately workable (need to think about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; more). To see why, remember that the commit_sig message includes HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; signatures for the _remote_ party's commitment transaction, so they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; spend the HTLCs if they broadcast their version of the commitment (force
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; close). If we don't somehow also _gain_ signatures (our new HTLC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signatures)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; allowing us to spend HTLCs on _their_ version of the commitment, then if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they broadcast that commitment (without revoking), then we're unable to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; redeem any of those HTLCs at all, possibly losing money.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, maybe the proposal wasn't clear. The idea isn't to add signatures to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> braodcasted transactions, but instead to CPFP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a maybe-broadcasted transaction by sending a transaction which spends it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and seeing if it is accepted. You only need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know the transaction's exact format (ie txid, which we do, since we sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a signature for it long ago) to do this, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't have to actually *have* the fully-signed transaction (and you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In an attempt to counteract this, we might say ok, the revoke message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; now includes HTLC signatures for their new commitment allowing us to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; our HTLCs. This resolves things in a weaker security model, but doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; address the issue generally, as after they receive the commit_sig, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; broadcast immediately, again leaving us without a way to redeem our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTLCs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'd need to think about it more, but it seems that following this path
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; require an overhaul in the channel state machine to make presenting a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; commitment actually take at least _two phases_ (at least a full round
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trip).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The first phase would tender the commitment, but render them unable to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; broadcast it. The second phase would then &lt;insert something something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; scriptless scripts here&gt; enter a new sub-protocol which upon conclusion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; gives the commitment proposer valid HTLC signatures, and gives the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what they need to be able to broadcast their commitment and claim their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; HTCLs in an atomic manner.
