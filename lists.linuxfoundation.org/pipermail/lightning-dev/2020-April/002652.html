<PRE>&#65279;Hmm, that's an interesting suggestion, it definitely raises the bar for attack execution rather significantly. Because lightning (and other second-layer systems) already relies heavily on uncensored access to blockchain data, its reasonable to extend the &quot;if you don't have enough blocks, aggressively query various sources to find new blocks, or, really just do it always&quot; solution to &quot;also send relevant transactions while we're at it&quot;.

Sadly, unlike for block data, there is no consensus mechanism for nodes to ensure the transactions in their mempools are the same as others. Thus, if you focus on sending the pinning transaction to miner nodes directly (which isn't trivial, but also not nearly as hard as it sounds), you could still pull off the attack. However, to do it now, you'd need to
wait for your counterparty to broadcast the corresponding timeout transaction (once it is confirmable, and can thus get into mempools), turning the whole thing into a mempool-acceptance race. Luckily there isn&#8217;t much cost to *trying*, though it&#8217;s less likely you&#8217;ll succeed.

There are also practical design issues - if you&#8217;re claiming multiple HTLC output in a single transaction the node would need to provide reject messages for each input which is conflicted, something which we&#8217;d need to think hard about the DoS implications of.

In any case, while it&#8217;s definitely better than nothing, it&#8217;s unclear if it&#8217;s really the kind of thing I&#8217;d want to rely on for my own funds.

</I>&gt;<i> This approach isn't perfect (if it even makes sense at all---I could be

</I>&gt;<i> BIP61 to be disabled in Bitcoin Core was its unreliability, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> if Bob had at least one honest peer that had the pinned transaction in

</I>&gt;<i> might be ok.
