<PRE>Hi Z,

&gt;<i> It seems to me that, if my cached understanding that `&lt;0&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` is sufficient to require RBF-flagging, then adding
</I>&gt;<i> that to the hashlock branch (2 witness bytes, 0.5 weight) would be a
</I>pretty
&gt;<i> low-weight mitigation against this attack.
</I>
I think this works...so they're forced to spend the output with a non-final
sequence number, meaning it *must* signal RBF. In this case, now it's the
timeout-er vs the success-er racing based on fee rate. If the honest party
(the
one trying to time out the HTLC) bids a fee rate higher (need to also
account
for the whole absolute fee replacement thing), then things should generally
work out in their favor.

&gt;<i> Good morning Laolu, Matt, and list,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  * With `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` we can make the C-side signature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  `SIGHASH_NOINPUT|SIGHASH_SINGLE` and allow B to re-sign the B-side
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  signature for a higher-fee version of HTLC-Timeout (assuming my cached
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  understanding of `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` still holds).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no_input isn't needed. With simply single+anyone can pay, then B can
</I>&gt;<i> attach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a new input+output pair to increase the fees on their HTLC redemption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction. As you mention, they now enter into a race against this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; malicious ndoe to bump up their fees in order to win over the other
</I>&gt;<i> party.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, right, that works as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the malicious node uses a non-RBF signalled transaction to sweep their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTLC, then we enter into another level of race, but this time on the
</I>&gt;<i> mempool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; propagation level. However, if there exists a relay path to a miner
</I>&gt;<i> running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; full RBF, then B's higher fee rate spend will win over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So basically:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * B has no mempool, because it wants to reduce its costs and etc.
</I>&gt;<i> * C broadcasts a non-RBF claim tx with low fee before A-&gt;B locktime (L+1).
</I>&gt;<i> * B does not notice this tx because:
</I>&gt;<i>   1.  The tx is too low fee to be put in a block.
</I>&gt;<i>   2.  B has no mempool so it cannot see the tx being propagated over the
</I>&gt;<i> P2P network.
</I>&gt;<i> * B tries to broadcast higher-fee HTLC-timeout, but fails because it
</I>&gt;<i> cannot replace a non-RBF tx.
</I>&gt;<i> * After L+1, C contacts the miners off-band and offers fee payment by
</I>&gt;<i> other means.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that, if my cached understanding that `&lt;0&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` is sufficient to require RBF-flagging, then adding
</I>&gt;<i> that to the hashlock branch (2 witness bytes, 0.5 weight) would be a pretty
</I>&gt;<i> low-weight mitigation against this attack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the combination below gives us good size:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The HTLC-Timeout signature from C is flagged with
</I>&gt;<i> `OP_SINGLE|OP_ANYONECANPAY`.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Normally, the HTLC-Timeout still deducts the fee from the value of the
</I>&gt;<i> UTXO being spent.
</I>&gt;<i>   * However, if B notices that the L+1 timeout is approaching, it can
</I>&gt;<i> fee-bump HTLC-Timeout with some onchain funds, recreating its own signature
</I>&gt;<i> but reusing the (still valid) C signature.
</I>&gt;<i> * The hashlock branch in this case includes `&lt;0&gt; OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`,
</I>&gt;<i> preventing C from broadcasting a low-fee claim tx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has the advantages:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * B does not need a mempool still and can run in `blocksonly`.
</I>&gt;<i> * The normal path is still the same as current behavior, we &quot;only&quot; add a
</I>&gt;<i> new path where if the L+1 timeout is approaching we fee-bump the
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC-Timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> * Costs are pretty low:
</I>&gt;<i>   * No need for extra RBF carve-out txo.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Just two additional witness bytes in the hashlock branch.
</I>&gt;<i> * No mempool rule changes needed, can be done with the P2P network of
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Probably still resilient even with future changes in mempool rules, as
</I>&gt;<i> long as typical RBF behaviors still remain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is my understanding correct?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     RBF Pinning HTLC Transactions (aka &quot;Oh, wait, I can steal funds,
</I>&gt;<i> how, now?&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     =============================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     You'll note that in the discussion of RBF pinning we were pretty
</I>&gt;<i> broad, and that that discussion seems to in fact cover
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     our HTLC outputs, at least when spent via (3) or (4). It does,
</I>&gt;<i> and in fact this is a pretty severe issue in today's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     lightning protocol [2]. A lightning counterparty (C, who
</I>&gt;<i> received the HTLC from B, who received it from A) today could,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     if B broadcasts the commitment transaction, spend an HTLC using
</I>&gt;<i> the preimage with a low-fee, RBF-disabled transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     After a few blocks, A could claim the HTLC from B via the
</I>&gt;<i> timeout mechanism, and then after a few days, C could get the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     HTLC-claiming transaction mined via some out-of-band agreement
</I>&gt;<i> with a small miner. This leaves B short the HTLC value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My (cached) understanding is that, since RBF is signalled using
</I>&gt;<i> `nSequence`, any `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` also automatically imposes the
</I>&gt;<i> requirement &quot;must be RBF-enabled&quot;, including `&lt;0&gt; OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Adding that clause (2 bytes in witness if my math is correct) to the
</I>&gt;<i> hashlock branch may be sufficient to prevent C from making an RBF-disabled
</I>&gt;<i> transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But then you mention out-of-band agreements with miners, which
</I>&gt;<i> basically means the transaction might not be in the mempool at all, in
</I>&gt;<i> which case the vulnerability is not really about RBF or relay, but sheer
</I>&gt;<i> economics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The payment is A-&gt;B-&gt;C, and the HTLC A-&gt;B must have a larger timeout
</I>&gt;<i> (L + 1) than the HTLC B-&gt;C (L), in abstract non-block units.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The vulnerability you are describing means that the current time must
</I>&gt;<i> now be L + 1 or greater (&quot;A could claim the HTLC from B via the timeout
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism&quot;, meaning the A-&gt;B HTLC has timed out already).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If so, then the B-&gt;C transaction has already timed out in the past and
</I>&gt;<i> can be claimed in two ways, either via B timeout branch or C hashlock
</I>&gt;<i> branch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This sets up a game where B and C bid to miners to get their version
</I>&gt;<i> of reality committed onchain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (We can neglect out-of-band agreements here; miners have the incentive
</I>&gt;<i> to publicly leak such agreements so that other potential bidders can offer
</I>&gt;<i> even higher fees for their versions of that transaction.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Before L+1, C has no incentive to bid, since placing any bid at all
</I>&gt;<i> will leak the preimage, which B can then turn around and use to spend from
</I>&gt;<i> A, and A and C cannot steal from B.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thus, B should ensure that *before* L+1, the HTLC-Timeout has been
</I>&gt;<i> committed onchain, which outright prevents this bidding war from even
</I>&gt;<i> starting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The issue then is that B is using a pre-signed HTLC-timeout, which is
</I>&gt;<i> needed since it is its commitment tx that was broadcast.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This prevents B from RBF-ing the HTLC-Timeout transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So what is needed is to allow B to add fees to HTLC-Timeout:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * We can add an RBF carve-out output to HTLC-Timeout, at the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> more blockspace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * With `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` we can make the C-side signature
</I>&gt;<i> `SIGHASH_NOINPUT|SIGHASH_SINGLE` and allow B to re-sign the B-side
</I>&gt;<i> signature for a higher-fee version of HTLC-Timeout (assuming my cached
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` still holds).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; With this, B can exponentially increase the fee as L+1 approaches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If B can get HTLC-Timeout confirmed before L+1, then C cannot steal
</I>&gt;<i> the HTLC value at all, since the UTXO it could steal from has already been
</I>&gt;<i> spent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In particular, it does not seem to me that it is necessary to change
</I>&gt;<i> the hashlock-branch transaction of C at all, since this mechanism is enough
</I>&gt;<i> to sidestep the issue (as I understand it).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But it does point to a need to make HTLC-Timeout (and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> symmetrically, HTLC-Success) also fee-bumpable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Note as well that this does not require a mempool: B can run in
</I>&gt;<i> `blocksonly` mode and as each block comes in from L to L+1, if HTLC-Timeout
</I>&gt;<i> is not confirmed, feebump HTLC-Timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In particular, HTLC-Timeout comes into play only if B broadcast its
</I>&gt;<i> own commitment transaction, and B *should* be aware that it did so ---
</I>&gt;<i> there is still no need for mempool monitoring here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Now, of course this only delays the war.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Let us now consider what C can do to ensure that the bidding war will
</I>&gt;<i> happen eventually.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * C can bribe a miner to prevent HTLC-Timeout from confirming between
</I>&gt;<i> L and L+1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   * Or in other words, this is a censorship attack.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     * The Bitcoin censorship-resistance model is that censored
</I>&gt;<i> transactions can be fee-bumped, which attracts non-censoring miners to try
</I>&gt;<i> their luck at mining and evict the censoring miner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       * Thus, letting B bump the fee on HTLC-Timeout is precisely the
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism we need.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       * This sets up a bidding war between C requesting miners to
</I>&gt;<i> censor, vs. B requesting miners to confirm, but that only sets the stage
</I>&gt;<i> for a second bidding war later between C and B, thus C is at a
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantage: it has to bribe miners to censor continuously from L to L+1
</I>&gt;<i> *and* additional bribe miners to confirm its transaction after L+1, whereas
</I>&gt;<i> B can offer its bribe as being something that miners can claim now without
</I>&gt;<i> waiting after L+1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The issue of course is the additional output that bloats the UTXO set
</I>&gt;<i> and requires another transaction to claim later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And if we have `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, it seems to me that
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun sidesteps this issue as well, as any timed-out
</I>&gt;<i> HTLC can be claimed with a fee-bumpable transaction directly without
</I>&gt;<i> RBF-carve-out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (As well, it seems to me that, if both nodes support doing so, a
</I>&gt;<i> Poon-Dryja channel can be upgraded, without onchain activity, to a
</I>&gt;<i> Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channel: sign a transaction spending the funding
</I>&gt;<i> tx to a txo that has been set up as Decker-Russell-Osuntokun, do not
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast that transaction, then revoke the latest Poon-Dryja commitment
</I>&gt;<i> transactions, then switch the mechanism over to Decker-Russell-Osuntokun;
</I>&gt;<i> you still need to monitor for previous Poon-Dryja commitment transactions,
</I>&gt;<i> but HTLCs now sidestep the issue under discussion here.)
