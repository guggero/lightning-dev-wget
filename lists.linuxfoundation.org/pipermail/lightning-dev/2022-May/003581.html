<PRE>Good morning ZmnSCPxj,

</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that a true validating Lightning signer would need to be a
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin node with active mitigation against eclipse attacks, the ability to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The UTXO Oracle(s) have some additional properties that improve on a plain
Bitcoin node:

- they provide compact attestations that can be checked in an
isolated/hardened environment, so that the signer doesn't need to be
exposed to a network stack and can live on a consumer device or HSM
- a UTXO Oracle can send out attestations on a broadcast medium (e.g. live
behind Tor, satellite, etc.), so it's harder to block or eclipse
- the periodic attestation would cover the current block hash, and a
commitment for the UTXO set hash (e.g. hash of the compact filter history)

Broadcast is a separate concern.  For broadcast, the intent is to have a
disaster recovery procedure:

- the signer sends out a heartbeat if it has a quorum of non-stale oracle
attestations and there are no upcoming safety deadlines (e.g. HTLC timeout
or need to breach-remedy)
- the heartbeats form a &quot;deadman's switch&quot; - if the node operator doesn't
get them, they spring into action
- the operator falls back to sneakernet for broadcasting a
closing/breach-remedy transaction if needed


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, a compromised node can lie and tell the signer that the block
</I>&gt;<i> height is much lower than it really is, letting the node peers clawback
</I>&gt;<i> incoming HTLCs and claim outgoing HTLCs, leading to a net loss of funds in
</I>&gt;<i> the forwarding case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, routing nodes really need to be aware of the on-chain status of
incoming channels.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at the link, it seems to me that you have a &quot;UTXO Set Oracle&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> does this inform your `lightning-signer` about block height and facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> transaction broadcast?
</I>&gt;<i> Is this intended to be a remote device from the `lightning-signer` device?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It could be a quorum of systems, remote from the signer device, some or all
of which may be under third-party operational control.  The attestation for
a certain block is deterministic, so they should all agree.


&gt;<i> If so, what happens if the connection between the &quot;UTXO Set Oracle&quot; remote
</I>&gt;<i> device and the `lightning-signer` is interrupted?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If there is no quorum, heartbeats would cease, which would alert the
operator to start disaster recovery.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular:
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed, that's the main attack scenario on a router that doesn't properly
chain the on-chain status of an input channel.

This seems to be listed in:
&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/docs/-/wikis/Potential-Exploits">https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/docs/-/wikis/Potential-Exploits</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an HTLC is failed and removed on the input before it is removed on the
</I>&gt;<i> output.  The output is then claimed by the counterparty, losing that amount
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a mitigation, planned or implemented, against this exploit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, heartbeats would cease and the operator would manually intervene as
above.

That said, there is another potential mode:  if you limit the value of
HTLCs in flight (e.g. 5% of channel value), are willing to lose that
amount, you don't do routing, and you have watchtowers, then you can live
without the UTXO Oracle component.  This may be acceptable in a consumer
application.

Finally, we could essentially embed UTXO Oracles into the network if:

- we commit to compact-filters or utreexo roots in the consensus
- we are OK with SPV-style security, where we detect an eclipse by noticing
a reduction in block rate

But it's hard to say when the first item might be plausibly deployed.
