Ah, this is an additional proposal on top, and requires a gossip &quot;hard fork&quot;, which means your new 
protocol would only work for taproot channels, and any old/unupgraded channels will have to be 
propagated via the old mechanism. I'd kinda prefer to be able to rip out the old gossip sync code 
sooner than a few years from now :(.

&gt;<i> If some nodes have 600000 and others have 600099 (because you broke the
</I>&gt;<i> ratelimiting recommendation, *and* propagated both approx the same
</I>&gt;<i> time), then the network will split, sure.
</I>
Right, so what do you do in that case, though? AFAIU, in your proposed sync mechanism if a node does 
this once, you're stuck with all of your gossip reconciliations with every peer &quot;wasting&quot; one 
difference &quot;slot&quot; for a day or however long it takes before the peer does a sane update. In my 
proposed alternative it only appears once and then you move on (or maybe once more on startup, but 
we can maybe be willing to take on some extra cost there?).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe.  What's a &quot;non-update&quot; based sketch?  Some huge percentage of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> gossip is channel_update, so it's kind of the thing we want?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oops, maybe we're on *very* different pages, here - I mean doing sketches based on &quot;the things that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I received since the last sync, ie all the gossip updates from the last hour&quot; vs doing sketches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on &quot;the things I have, ie my full gossip store&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that requires state.  Full store requires none, keeping it
</I>&gt;<i> super-simple
</I>
Heh, I'm surprised you'd complain about this - IIUC your existing gossip storage system keeps this 
as a side-effect so it'd be a single integer for y'all :p. In any case, if it makes the protocol a 
chunk more efficient I don't see why its a big deal to keep track of the set of which invoices have 
changed recently, you could even make it super efficient by just saying &quot;anything more recent than 
timestamp X *except* a few exceptions that we got with some lag against the update timestamp&quot;.

Better, the state is global, not per-peer, and a small fraction of the total state of the gossip 
store anyway, so its not like its introducing some new giant or non-constant-factor blowup.
