<PRE>Three small updates:

1)
The most recent version of lnd-manageJ now also considers channels that
charge a base fee. In order to make this work, the worst-case scenario
is assumed (which is: a channel is used for the smallest possible amount)
and the fee rate used for the route computation is adjusted accordingly.

With the default settings (quantization 10,000sat), a channel charging a
base fee of Xsat and a fee rate of Yppm is considered with a virtual fee
rate of (Y+X*100)ppm.

This penalty is linear in the quantization amount, i.e. if you use a
quantization of 100,000sat, a base fee of Xsat only results in a
penalty of X*10ppm.

2)
I added a Dockerfile that should help with experiments.
<A HREF="https://github.com/C-Otto/lnd-manageJ/blob/fix-5746/Dockerfile">https://github.com/C-Otto/lnd-manageJ/blob/fix-5746/Dockerfile</A>

The only interesting requirement is that your lnd needs to be patched:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6545">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6545</A>

You can tweak the lnd-manageJ.conf (as demonstrated in lines 10-12), see
<A HREF="https://github.com/C-Otto/lnd-manageJ/blob/main/PickhardtPayments.md">https://github.com/C-Otto/lnd-manageJ/blob/main/PickhardtPayments.md</A> for
the available options.

As I was unable to figure out how to avoid TLS issues with gRPC, you
need to use &quot;--network host&quot; if you run lnd on localhost.

The docker image boots PostgreSQL on the default port 5432, so make sure
it is available and not in use by your host.

For your experiments please take into account that lnd-manageJ needs to
request the LN graph from lnd, which takes a few seconds. This graph is
cached for up to two minutes and, if used, refreshed before it times out.
As such, please issue a test payment (to request the graph) before
measuring the time it takes to send out any real payment.

3)
Route/hop hints provided in the payment request are now considered so that
private/virtual channels are used for the route computation. This only
works for &quot;route hints&quot; which contain a single hop (which should be
fine?). Each &quot;hint&quot; channel is added with a capacity of 50 BTC and the
algorithm is made to believe that 100% of that is available. This &quot;known
liquidity&quot; is not shown in the streaming NDJSON output you get via HTTP,
though, which is just a display issue which doesn't affect the route
computation.

Happy hacking,
Carsten
