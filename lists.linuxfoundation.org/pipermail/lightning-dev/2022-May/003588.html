<PRE>Oops, sorry, I don't really monitor the dev lists but once every few months so this fell off my plate :/

Yep, makes sense.

</I>
Right, you'd end up downloading the thing you rate-limited, but only once (possibly per-peer). If 
you use the total-sync approach you'd download it on every sync, vs a &quot;only updates&quot; approach you'd 
do it once.

&gt;&gt;<i> I agree there should be *some* rough consensus, but rate-limits are a locally-enforced thing, not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global one. There will always be races and updates you reject that your peers dont, no matter the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure it does!  It severly limits the set divergence to race conditions
</I>&gt;<i> (down to block height divergence, in practice).
</I>
Huh? There's always some line you draw, if an update happens right on the line (which they almost 
certainly often will because people want to update, and they'll update every X hours to whatever the 
rate limit is), then ~half the network will accept the update and half won't. I don't see how you 
solve this problem.
&gt;<i> Maybe.  What's a &quot;non-update&quot; based sketch?  Some huge percentage of
</I>&gt;<i> gossip is channel_update, so it's kind of the thing we want?
</I>
Oops, maybe we're on *very* different pages, here - I mean doing sketches based on &quot;the things that 
I received since the last sync, ie all the gossip updates from the last hour&quot; vs doing sketches 
based on &quot;the things I have, ie my full gossip store&quot;.
