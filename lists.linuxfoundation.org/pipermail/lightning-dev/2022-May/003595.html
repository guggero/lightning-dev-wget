Dear Ren&#233;,

a few years ago I made a very small contribution to this list by posting 
a paper on &quot;Modeling a Steady-State Lightning Network Economy&quot;:

<A HREF="../2019-August/002115.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-August/002115.html</A>

I mention it here because perhaps there are some ideas tangentially 
related to the research program you are conducting on routing 
strategies. I copy below the abstract and a relevant quote (full paper 
here: <A HREF="https://github.com/gr-g/ln-steady-state-model">https://github.com/gr-g/ln-steady-state-model</A>). In particular you 
can find a link between the idea of &quot;drain&quot; you defined and the concept 
of &quot;demand imbalance&quot; in the paper.

Abstract:

/In this paper, we consider an idealized scenario in which the Lightning //
//Network (or any similar payment network) has scaled to the size and //
//volume of a self-sustained economy, meaning that the number of on-chain //
//transactions - including channel opening and closing - has become //
//negligible when compared to the number of off-chain transactions, and //
//payments continuously flow across a network with relatively stable //
//topology. We take this scenario to the extreme and model a network 
where //
//the channels are fixed, so that payments form a completely closed //
//system, and where nodes have (on a long enough timescale) stable and //
//perfectly balanced incoming and outgoing payments (i.e. they spend //
//exactly what they earn). We call this scenario the &quot;steady-state //
//economy&quot; of the payment network.//
//
//We argue that in such scenario, in a network of n connected nodes, //
//there is a tendency towards a state where exactly n-1 channels have //
//perfectly balanced flows in the two directions (&quot;self-balancing&quot; //
//channels), while all other channels are either unused, or have a //
//permanent tendency towards imbalance: the channel balance accumulates 
at //
//one end and the channel is only intermittently available in one //
//direction (&quot;stuttering&quot; channels). We note that the &quot;self-balancing&quot; //
//channels form a spanning tree of the network graph, which we call the //
//&quot;core spanning tree&quot; of the payment network.//
//
//We also try to derive some practical lessons from this idealized //
//scenario, hopefully providing some useful insight to node operators of //
//the current (embryonic) Lightning Network.//
//
//At the end of the paper, we provide some remarks on the more general //
//case in which nodes do not balance their income and expenses.//
/

 From section 4:

/There is general consensus on the //fact that having a large fraction 
of channels
not usable or barely usable in one////direction is not a healthy 
predicament for the
network, and that some form of////channel management will need to be 
practiced
by node operators involving a mix////of rebalancing and fee fine-tuning. 
However,
one of the main takeaways of the////analysis of the steady-state model 
is that the
network might have a tendency////to push////most////of the channels 
(when not unused)
towards being chronically////unbalanced.//
//We wonder if these two tools (rebalancing and fee management) are really//
//enough to contrast the tendency toward imbalance. If not, it would be 
appro-//
//priate to consider also other strategies to &#8220;work with the imbalances&#8221; 
instead//
//of fighting them.////We refer, for example, to efficient low-latency 
mechanisms//
//to signal when a channel becomes unusable in one direction, in order 
to limit//
//the failure rate, together with a general robustness of the network 
against a//
//pervasive and high-volume flow of information about channels that 
switch from//
//being available to not available and vice versa (or that switch 
between low fees//
//and high fees)./

Kind regards,

Gregorio
