<PRE>Its probably worth somewhat disentangling the concept of switching to a minimum-cost flow routing 
algorithm from the concept of &quot;scoring based on channel value and estimated available liquidity&quot;.

These are two largely-unrelated concepts that are being mashed into one in this description - the 
first concept needs zero-base-fee to be exact, though its not clear to me that a heuristics-based 
approach won't give equivalent results in practice, given the noise in success rate compared to 
theory here.

The second concept is something that LDK (and I believe CLN and maybe even eclair now) do already, 
though lnd does not last I checked. For payments where MPP does not add much to success rate (i.e. 
payments where the amount is relatively &quot;low&quot; compared to available network liquidity) dijkstra's 
with a liquidity/channel-size based scoring will give you the exact same result.

For cases where you're sending an amount which is &quot;high&quot; compared to available network liquidity, 
taking a minimum-cost-flow algorithm becomes important, as you point out. Of course you're always 
going to suffer really slow payment and many retires in this case anyway.

</I>&gt;<i> the most recent version of lnd-manageJ [1] now includes basic, but usable,
</I>&gt;<i> support for #PickhardtPayments. I kindly invite you to check out the code, give
</I>&gt;<i> it a try, and use this work for upcoming experiments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Teaser with video: <A HREF="https://twitter.com/c_otto83/status/1525879972786749453">https://twitter.com/c_otto83/status/1525879972786749453</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem, heavily summarized:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Sending payments in the LN often fails, especially with larger amounts.
</I>&gt;<i> - Splitting a large payment into smaller shards (using MPP) is helpful,
</I>&gt;<i>    as in general the smaller shards don't fail as often as a single large
</I>&gt;<i>    payment would. However, the success probability also drops
</I>&gt;<i>    exponentially with the number of channels included [2].
</I>&gt;<i> - Finding routes through the LN is tricky, as the channels' liquidity is
</I>&gt;<i>    uncertain at the time of computing the routes and a simple &quot;trial and
</I>&gt;<i>    error&quot; approach might take too long.
</I>&gt;<i> - There are several implementations using various heuristics, taking
</I>&gt;<i>    aspects like fees, previous failures, HTLC deltas, channel age, ...
</I>&gt;<i>    into account. Comparing these approaches is very hard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The gist of #PickhardtPayments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The issue of finding MPP routes in the LN corresponds to the
</I>&gt;<i>    well-known minimum-cost flow problem in computer science (graph
</I>&gt;<i>    theory) with lots of related research, results, algorithms, ...
</I>&gt;<i> - As shown in the paper [3] the results are optimal, no matter which
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;cost&quot; function is used to reason about routing costs (fees) and/or
</I>&gt;<i>    reliability. However, depending on the characteristics of the
</I>&gt;<i>    function, actually finding optimal results can be extremely hard
</I>&gt;<i>    (NP-complete in some cases). By imposing the zero base fee limitation
</I>&gt;<i>    and assuming a uniform distribution of funds, fast implementations
</I>&gt;<i>    (polynomial time with sub-second runtimes) can be used.
</I>&gt;<i> - Assuming (!) a uniform distribution of funds in each channel and zero
</I>&gt;<i>    base fee only, #PickhardtPayments offers an approach that is optimal,
</I>&gt;<i>    i.e. proven perfect and computationally feasible.
</I>&gt;<i> - The most basic version only considers uncertainty costs for
</I>&gt;<i>    reliability, but it is possible (and implemented in lnd-manageJ) to
</I>&gt;<i>    also consider routing costs (fee rates) and optimize for both features
</I>&gt;<i>    to come up with reliable and cheap-ish MPPs.
</I>&gt;<i> - The implementation of #PickhardtPayments in lnd-manageJ needs to
</I>&gt;<i>    ignore non-zero base fee channels to avoid extremely slow
</I>&gt;<i>    (NP-complete) computations. Furthermore, certain aspects are
</I>&gt;<i>    approximated [4]. As such, optimality claims are limited to the zero
</I>&gt;<i>    base fee subset of the LN, and real-world experiments might be tricky
</I>&gt;<i>    to interpret. However, as also shown in the testnet videos [5][6],
</I>&gt;<i>    first results are very promising!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The real strength of #PickhardtPayments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Liquidity information, for example obtained by previous failures, is
</I>&gt;<i>    taken into account. For each attempt, the relevant bits of information
</I>&gt;<i>    are obtained and will be used to guide the following attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> - As the underlying algorithm is proven to be optimal, we do not need to
</I>&gt;<i>    rely on heuristics. Instead, the algorithm happily finds routes that
</I>&gt;<i>    may be very long (but very probable/cheap, for whatever reason), have
</I>&gt;<i>    a surprising number of shards, or rather odd amounts.
</I>&gt;<i> - The underlying algorithm also deals with shared segments, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i>    individual channels that are used for more than one shard of the MPP,
</I>&gt;<i>    without oversaturating it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code in lnd-manageJ:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Highly experimental, but it's a start!
</I>&gt;<i> - lnd + gRPC middleware + Java/Spring + PostgreSQL is a bit more complex
</I>&gt;<i>    than necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> - Only works with lnd.
</I>&gt;<i> - Doesn't really work with lnd until issue #5746 [7] is fixed. I'd be
</I>&gt;<i>    very happy for someone to have a look at my proposal (PR #6543 [8])!
</I>&gt;<i> - The code doesn't handle all corner cases, especially the
</I>&gt;<i>    less-than-usual failure codes. For example, if a node decides to raise
</I>&gt;<i>    the fee rate, the corresponding channel will be ignored for a while as
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm too lazy to think about how to update the information in the data
</I>&gt;<i>    structure used to compute the MPP.
</I>&gt;<i> - Pending shards (neither failed nor settled) just cause the whole MPP
</I>&gt;<i>    to hang until something times out. Most likely this can't be fixed
</I>&gt;<i>    without stuckless payments?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be very happy to discuss implementation details (not on this list, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess?) and help with upcoming (mainnet?) benchmarks and experiments
</I>&gt;<i> (Ren&#233; Pickhardt is also interested in helping with this). Given a fix
</I>&gt;<i> for the blocking lnd issue, I'd be happy to let my node c-otto.de take
</I>&gt;<i> part in some experiments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last but not least, a huge thank you to Ren&#233; Pickhardt for lots of
</I>&gt;<i> insightful discussions, proof reading, and of course (together with
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan Richter) the actual work of coming up with #PickhardtPayments!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Carsten
