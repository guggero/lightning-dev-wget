</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sure it does!  It severly limits the set divergence to race conditions

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Huh? There's always some line you draw, if an update happens right on the line (which they almost 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly often will because people want to update, and they'll update every X hours to whatever the 
</I>&gt;<i> rate limit is), then ~half the network will accept the update and half won't. I don't see how you 
</I>&gt;<i> solve this problem.
</I>
The update contains a block number.  Let's say we allow an update every
100 blocks.  This must be &lt;= current block height (and presumably, newer
than height - 2016).

If you send an update number 600000, and then 600100, it will propagate.
600099 will not.

If some nodes have 600000 and others have 600099 (because you broke the
ratelimiting recommendation, *and* propagated both approx the same
time), then the network will split, sure.

We could be fascist and penalize nodes which do this, but that's
overkill unless it actually happens a lot.

Nodes which want to keep an potential update &quot;up their sleeve&quot; will
backdate updates by 101 blocks (everyone should do this, in fact).

As I said, this has a problem with block height differences, but that's
explicitly included in the messages so you can ignore and wait if you
want.  Again, may not be a problem in practice.

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe.  What's a &quot;non-update&quot; based sketch?  Some huge percentage of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gossip is channel_update, so it's kind of the thing we want?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oops, maybe we're on *very* different pages, here - I mean doing sketches based on &quot;the things that 
</I>&gt;<i> I received since the last sync, ie all the gossip updates from the last hour&quot; vs doing sketches 
</I>&gt;<i> based on &quot;the things I have, ie my full gossip store&quot;.
</I>
But that requires state.  Full store requires none, keeping it
super-simple

Though Alex has a idea for a &quot;include even the expired entries&quot; then
&quot;regenerate every N blocks&quot; which avoids the problem that each change is
two deltas (one remove, one add), at cost of some complexity.

Cheers,
Rusty.
