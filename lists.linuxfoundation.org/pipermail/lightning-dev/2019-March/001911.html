<PRE>Hi all!

        Roasbeef suggested we split up option_simplified_commitment,
since it is fairly ambitious.  In particular, he wanted the static
remote_key feature ASAP, and Christian agreed.

I chose to add the fairly trivial symmetric output to this, as it
affects the same output, and resolves the gaming around &quot;no, you close
please, no you close&quot;...

No PR yet, but you can see it here:

        <A HREF="https://github.com/rustyrussell/lightning-rfc/commit/c5adc5ae19b29b0d8947a9d3acf181134e7dc352">https://github.com/rustyrussell/lightning-rfc/commit/c5adc5ae19b29b0d8947a9d3acf181134e7dc352</A>

And pasted below for inline commentry:

    option_static_remotekey: first draft.
    
    This separates out the symmetric CTLV and static remotekey changes
    from the more ambitious option_simplified_commitment (which also
    included pushme outputs and bring-your-own-fee for HTLC outputs).
    
    This is a much simpler stepping stone, and resolves one immediate
    problem.

 The reason for the separate transaction stage for HTLC outputs is so that HTLCs can timeout or be fulfilled even though they are within the `to_self_delay` delay.
 Otherwise, the required minimum timeout on HTLCs is lengthened by this delay, causing longer timeouts for HTLCs traversing the network.
 
+If `option_static_remotekey` applies to the commitment transaction, then the `to_self_delay` used for all transactions is the greater of the `to_self_delay` sent by each peer.  Otherwise, each peer sends the `to_self_delay` to be used for the other peer's commitment and HTLC transactions.

 The amounts for each output MUST be rounded down to whole satoshis. If this amount, minus the fees for the HTLC transaction, is less than the `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the owner of the commitment transaction, the output MUST NOT be produced (thus the funds add to fees).
