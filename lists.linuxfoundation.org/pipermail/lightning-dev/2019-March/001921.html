AJ, this was a meandering random walk which shed very little light.

I don't find the differentiation between malicious and non-malicious
double-spends convincing.  Even if you trust A, you already have to
worry about person-who-sent-the-coins-to-A.  This expands that set to be
&quot;miner who mined coins sent-to-A&quot;, but it's very hard to see what
difference that makes to how you'd handle coins from A.

&gt;<i> Beyond that, I think NOINPUT has two fundamental ways to cause problems
</I>&gt;<i> for the people doing NOINPUT sigs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1) your signature gets applied to a unexpectedly different
</I>&gt;<i>     script, perhaps making it look like you've being dealing
</I>&gt;<i>     with some blacklisted entity. OP_MASK and similar solves
</I>&gt;<i>     this.
</I>
... followed by two paragraphs describing how it's not a &quot;fundamental
way to cause problems&quot; that you (or I) can see.

&gt;<i> For the second case, that seems a little more concerning. The nightmare
</I>&gt;<i> scenario is maybe something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * naive users do silly things with NOINPUT signatures, and end up
</I>&gt;<i>    losing funds due to replays like the above
</I>
As we've never seen with SIGHASH_NONE?

&gt;<i>  * initial source of funds was some major exchange, who decide it's
</I>&gt;<i>    cheaper to refund the lost funds than deal with the customer complaints
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * the lost funds end up costing enough that major exchanges just outright
</I>&gt;<i>    ban sending funds to any address capable of NOINPUT, which also bans
</I>&gt;<i>    all taproot/schnorr addresses
</I>
I don't find this remotely credible.

&gt;<i> FWIW, I don't have a strong opinion here yet, but:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - I'm still inclined to err on the side of putting more safety
</I>&gt;<i>    measures in for NOINPUT, rather than fewer
</I>
In theory, sure.  But not feel-good and complex &quot;safety measures&quot; which
don't actually help in practical failure scenarios.

&gt;<i>  - the &quot;must have a sig that commits to the input tx&quot; seems like it
</I>&gt;<i>    should be pretty safe, not too expensive, and keeps taproot's privacy
</I>&gt;<i>    benefits in the cases where you end up needing to use NOINPUT
</I>
If this is considered necessary, can it be a standardness rule rather
than consensus?

Thanks,
Rusty.
