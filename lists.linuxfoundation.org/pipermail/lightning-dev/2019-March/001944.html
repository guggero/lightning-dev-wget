<PRE>Good morning ZmnSCPxj,

Maybe I oversee something - in that case sorry for spamming the list - but
I don't understand how you could know the distance from yourself if you
don't know the entire topology? (unless u use it on the pruned view as you
suggested)

On the other hand querying for a certain depth would be possible with the
suggested `query ask egonetwork` in case for depth 3 one would have to peer
with the nodes from the friend of a friend network.

Best Rene

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear ZmnSCPxj and fellow lightning developers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want to point out two things and make a suggestion for a new gossip
</I>&gt;<i> message.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A good pruning heuristic is &quot;channel capacity&quot;, which can be checked
</I>&gt;<i> onchain (the value of the UTXO backing the channel is the channel capacity).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It is good to keep channels with large capacity in the routemap,
</I>&gt;<i> because such large channels are more likely to successfully route a payment
</I>&gt;<i> than smaller channels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So it is reasonable to delete channels with low capacity when the
</I>&gt;<i> routemap memory is becoming close to full.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Intuitively (without simulation). I encourage to make that process not
</I>&gt;<i> deerministic but rather probabilistic. It would be good if everyone had a
</I>&gt;<i> different set of channels. (which is somewhat achieved with everyone
</I>&gt;<i> keeping their local view)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At a software engineer point-of-view, probabilistic can be difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> test.
</I>&gt;<i> This can be made deterministic by including an RNG seed in the input to
</I>&gt;<i> this code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, let me propose instead, in combination with your later thought:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Nodes still need to track their direct channels (so they are
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly always in the routemap).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I strongly advice that the local view should be extended. Every node
</I>&gt;<i> should always track their friends of a friend network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the pruning rule can be modified to include *distance from self*
</I>&gt;<i> in addition to channel capacity.
</I>&gt;<i> The nearer the channel is, the more likely it is retained.
</I>&gt;<i> The further, the less likely.
</I>&gt;<i> The larger the channel is, the more likely it is retained.
</I>&gt;<i> The smaller, the less likely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The capacity divided by the distance can be used as a sorting key, and if
</I>&gt;<i> pruning is needed, the smallest &quot;score&quot; is pruned until the routemap fits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will lead to everyone having a different set of channels, while being
</I>&gt;<i> likely to track their friend-of-friend network compared to more distant
</I>&gt;<i> nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the pruning itself would affect the distance of the channel to
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;self&quot; node.
</I>&gt;<i> So determinism may be difficult to achieve here anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
</I>&gt;<i>
