<PRE>Dear ZmnSCPxj and fellow lightning developers,

I want to point out two things and make a suggestion for a new gossip
message.

A good pruning heuristic is &quot;channel capacity&quot;, which can be checked
&gt;<i> onchain (the value of the UTXO backing the channel is the channel capacity).
</I>&gt;<i> It is good to keep channels with large capacity in the routemap, because
</I>&gt;<i> such large channels are more likely to successfully route a payment than
</I>&gt;<i> smaller channels.
</I>&gt;<i> So it is reasonable to delete channels with low capacity when the routemap
</I>&gt;<i> memory is becoming close to full.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Intuitively (without simulation). I encourage to make that process not
deerministic but rather probabilistic. It would be good if everyone had a
different set of channels. (which is somewhat achieved with everyone
keeping their local view)

Nodes still need to track their direct channels (so they are implicitly
&gt;<i> always in the routemap).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I strongly advice that the local view should be extended. Every node should
always track their friends of a friend network. Maybe we could even create
a new gossip query message `query_ask_egonetwork` that asks for the
egonetwork of a node (the egonetwork are all the direct friends of a node
together with their friendships) every node knows at least the nodes in
their ego network and over time also the edges between them.

If I was interested in my friend of a friend network I could just send the
`query_ask_egonetwork` message to all my peers.

Best Rene






But payee nodes making BOLT1 invoices could also provide `r` routes in the
&gt;<i> invoice, with the given routes being from nodes with high-capacity
</I>&gt;<i> channels, so that even if the intermediate channels are pruned due to low
</I>&gt;<i> capacity, it is possible to get paid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
