</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I can see we mostly agree on the spec, with some issues that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; should be deferred until later/to other specs:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - Key-rotation policies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, I've been thinking about the costs of key-rotation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I forgot that we have two potential key-rotations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Rotating the key used in transactions that hit the Bitcoin network
</I>
Oh, that's different, yes.

&gt;<i>  - Rotating the public key used for the DH shared secret generation
</I>&gt;<i>    for the onion routing protocol
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment I was concentrating on the latter.
</I>
Yes.  It's the one we need to communicate through the node.

&gt;&gt;<i> Change Assumptions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) We use a &quot;comms&quot; key for each node instead of its ID.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Nodes send out a new comms key, signed by ID.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's another 33 bytes each to keep, or 8.25MB.  To rotate a comms key,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need the new key (33 bytes), and a signature from the id (64 bytes),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and probably a timestamp, (4 bytes), that's 25.25MB.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's not too bad if we rotate daily.  Probably not if we rotate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hourly..
</I>
&gt;<i> A node's public key used for DH shared secret generation exists
</I>&gt;<i> independently of its channels. I think we probably should not bind the
</I>&gt;<i> rotation of the key we use to talk to that node to one of its
</I>&gt;<i> channels. However, it does make sense to require that a node also has
</I>&gt;<i> at least one active channel in order for us to care at all :-)
</I>
This calculation was per-node, not per-channel.

&gt;<i> The comms key approach is in line with what I was thinking as well.
</I>&gt;<i> We can bind the new communication key with the channel's existence by
</I>&gt;<i> showing a derivation path from the node's (fixed) public key and the
</I>&gt;<i> new key. So a node wanting to rotate its communication key just sends
</I>&gt;<i> the following: &quot;I am &lt;pubkey&gt; (33 byte), please use key &lt;derivation
</I>&gt;<i> number&gt; (~4 byte) and here is a &lt;signature&gt; (64 bytes) that I signed
</I>&gt;<i> this rotation off.&quot;. The communication overhead is identical to your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, but, since you send only the new key, I think in your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal we'd have to churn through all known node ids to find which
</I>&gt;<i> one signed the rotation, or where you also using timestamp based
</I>&gt;<i> derivation?
</I>
Hmm, do we lose forward secrecy if we use a BIP32 chain?  But we may be
able to use another derivation method where we derive key N from key
N-1.  I'm looking at Laolu...

&gt;<i> Another case we could consider is having passive rotations: when an
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint announces a channel's existence it also sends its rotation
</I>&gt;<i> interval along. Every &lt;rotation interval&gt; nodes simply derive the new
</I>&gt;<i> key and use that for the DH shared secret generation should they want
</I>&gt;<i> to talk to this node. And nodes have a switchover window in which they
</I>&gt;<i> accept both (would be necessary in the active rotation as well due to
</I>&gt;<i> delays). The passive rotation incurs no communication overhead and can
</I>&gt;<i> be bound to the node's channels, so as long as we believe one of its
</I>&gt;<i> channels to exist, we rotate its keys.
</I>
I like the zero-comms overhead!  We could in fact use block number to
rotate; key 1 is used for the first N blocks, then key 2, etc, with old
keys allowed X blocks late, new keys allowed X blocks early?

I think we should select some N for the moment, rather than making it
configurable.  If it's too small it might take a long time for clients
to derive the current key: 50 usecs each step is almost half a second
for a year-old key if we rotate every 6 blocks.  Rotation daily makes
that much more approachable...

&gt;<i> Possibly a mix of active and passive would make sense, with the active
</I>&gt;<i> rotation enabling emergency rotations in case a key was compromised,
</I>&gt;<i> but we're in a lot of trouble then anyway :-)
</I>
In that case, you close the channels and start a new node?

Cheers,
Rusty.
