<PRE>Hi ZmnSCPxj,
      Thank you for the explanation. So I went through BOLT 04
specification and quoting a few error possibilities:

An *intermediate hop* MUST NOT, but the *final node*:

   - if the payment_secret doesn't match the expected value for that
   payment_hash, or the payment_secret is required and is not present:
      - MUST fail the HTLC.
      - MUST return an incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details error.
   - if the payment hash is unknown:
      - MUST fail the HTLC.
      - MUST return an incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details error.
      So it is the final node which is expected to fail the htlc in these 2
   cases. But then what if final node denies revealing the secret?  Say in the
   scenario A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D, D doesn't reveal the secret. So in such a case, what
   is C supposed to do? Shall it resort to condition no. 1( secret doesn't
   match), generate an error message and unlock funds of A-&gt;B and B-&gt;C as soon
   as possible?

&gt;<i> Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another question related to the paper <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00003.">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00003.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Over here, it is stated in page 13, &quot;Surge of unresolved HTLCs while
</I>&gt;<i> probing: Recalling steps 5-7 in Figure 4, each probe sets up a chain of
</I>&gt;<i> irredeemable HTLCs (since a matching preimage would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> brute-forced). Eventually, running multiple probes over the same channels
</I>&gt;<i> will escrow its funds in these HTLCs, effectively DOSing the probe route
</I>&gt;<i> and forcing the nodes to wait until the HTLCs time out before being able to
</I>&gt;<i> forward other payments. This is an issue we encountered over and over
</I>&gt;<i> during 4.2 and 4.3, often giving us one shot at probing before having to
</I>&gt;<i> wait multiple hours for the HTLCs to expire. This is also why we chose the
</I>&gt;<i> channels leading up to our final target to have a much higher balance, so
</I>&gt;<i> that we would have enough..&quot; So there was no matching preimage with
</I>&gt;<i> receiver as per Fig 4. So that means in the route say A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D, if D
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have a matching preimage and suppose C-&gt;D uses lock time of 144
</I>&gt;<i> blocks, B-&gt;C 288 blocks and A-&gt;B uses a locktime of 432 blocks, so won't be
</I>&gt;<i> the case funds in A-&gt;B and B-&gt;C still remains locked for the mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> locktime?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is helpful to remember that inside a channel, every contract has an
</I>&gt;<i> implicit branch &quot;if both of us in this channel agree, we can spend this
</I>&gt;<i> contract funds any way we want&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is because every contract is dependent on a transaction spending from
</I>&gt;<i> a 2-of-2, and both parties can always sign a new 2-of-2 transaction without
</I>&gt;<i> that contract --- it is just that both have to agree to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In case of a reported failure, the receiving node in the channel basically
</I>&gt;<i> says &quot;just between the two of us, I will not be able to claim this HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> using the hashlock branch anyway because &lt;BOLT 4 failure code reason&gt;, so
</I>&gt;<i> this will inevitably be claimable to you in the timelock anyway, so we
</I>&gt;<i> might as well just agree to re-assign the HTLC funds back to you right now&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sending node is then willing to sign off on this
</I>&gt;<i> outside-of-the-contract agreement, since it lets it get the funds back
</I>&gt;<i> before the timelock expires, and to reuse those funds otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, even if D griefs up to 143 blocks it wants, at the 144th block C can
</I>&gt;<i> report immediately back to B and then A with the above failure mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B and C are incentivized to do this quickly since it would allow the funds
</I>&gt;<i> to be reused again in a different, probably-will-not-be-griefed near-future
</I>&gt;<i> payment, which might earn them fees in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus if B and C are not controlled by the A+D conglomerate then they have
</I>&gt;<i> no incentive to extend the griefing attack further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, if either B or C is offline at the time, then the new state
</I>&gt;<i> where the HTLC is removed out-of-contract is not possible to sign with both
</I>&gt;<i> parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know this is not the definition of griefing attack but then can this
</I>&gt;<i> possibly mimic the situation where receiver denies having the correct
</I>&gt;<i> preimage?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, since B and C are incentivized to report this immediately in order to
</I>&gt;<i> free up the funds in order for them to forward &quot;soon&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
</I>&gt;<i>
