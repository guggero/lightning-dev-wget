<PRE>Good morning list,

Thanks Rusty for following up on this, I'm glad it may be useful for offers!
I certainly want this as well for wallet users' privacy.

I have gathered my proposal in a better format than my previous gist here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/route-blinding/proposals/route-blinding.md">https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/route-blinding/proposals/route-blinding.md</A>

You will note that I've been able to simplify the scheme a bit compared to
my
gist. It's now very clear that this is exactly the same kind of secrets
derivation than what Sphinx does. I still have things I want to add to the
proposal, but at least the crypto part should be ready to review (and I
think
it does need more eyes on it).

Feel free to add comments directly on the branch commits, it may be easier
to
review that way. Let me know if you think I should turn it into a draft PR
to
facilitate discussions. It kept it vague on some specific parts on purpose
(such as invoice fields, encrypted blob format); we will learn from early
prototype implementations and enrich the proposal as we go.

A few comments on your previous mails. I have removed the (ab)use of
`payment_secret`, but I think your comment on using the `blinding` to
replace
it would not work because that blinding is known by the next-to-last node
(which computes it and forwards it to the final node).
The goal of `payment_secret` is explicitly to avoid having the next-to-last
node
discover it to prevent him from probing. But I think that you didn't plan on
doing the blinding the same way I'm doing it, which may explain the
difference.

As for ZmnSCPxj's suggestion, I think there is the same kind of issue.
The secrets we establish with anonymous multi-hops locks are between the
*sender*
and each of the hops. In the route blinding case, what we're adding are
secrets
between the *recipient* and the hops, and we don't want the sender to be
able to
influence those. It's a kind of reverse Sphinx. So I'm not sure yet the
recipient
could safely contribute to those secrets, but maybe we'll find a nice trick
in
the future!

Cheers,
Bastien

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good morning Rusty, et al.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Note that this means no payment secret is necessary, since the incoming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; `blinding` serves the same purpose. If we wanted to, we could (ab)use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; payment_secret as the first 32-bytes to put in Carol's enc1 (i.e. it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the ECDH for Carol to decrypt enc1).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I confess to not reading everything in detail, but it seems to me that,
</I>&gt;<i> with payment point + scalar and path decorrelation, we need to establish a
</I>&gt;<i> secret with each hop anyway (the blinding scalar for path decorrelation),
</I>&gt;<i> so if you need a secret per hop, possibly this could be reused as well?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, this could be used the same way, though for that secret it can
</I>&gt;<i> simply be placed inside the onion rather than passed alongside.
