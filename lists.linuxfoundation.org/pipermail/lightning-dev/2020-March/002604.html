<PRE>Good morning Subhra,

&gt;<i> Thanks ZmnSCPxj. Just a clarification on the idea proposed so that means here B needs to delay the HTLC acceptance?&#160; Pardon my knowledge on c-lightning, but what exactly happens upon htlc_acceptance? Release of preimage or just an acknowledgment by B reaching to the point of irrevocably committed?&#160;&#160;
</I>
This event is emitted when an incoming HTLC is irrevocably committed.
This is a hook, and what happens will depend on what the hook returns:

* It returns `{&quot;result&quot;:&quot;continue&quot;}`: normal processing of the HTLC (forward, fail, or claim as normal operation).
* It returns `{&quot;result&quot;:&quot;fail&quot;, &quot;failure_message&quot;: &quot;2002&quot;}`: fail the HTLC with the given failure message, failure message is a hex-encoded failure blob, see BOLT 4 for how.
* It returns `{&quot;result&quot;: &quot;resolve&quot;, &quot;payment_key&quot;: &quot;0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&quot;}`: claim the HTLC regardless of whether it is a forward or terminates here, the given `payment_key` is the 64-hex-digits encoding of the preimage.

For the most part, for purposes of griefing, you can just delay the default `{&quot;result&quot;:&quot;continue&quot;}` for as long as you want to grief the payment, this will work for both forwards and payment receives correctly, except griefed.

See [our docs](<A HREF="https://lightning.readthedocs.io/PLUGINS.html#htlc-accepted">https://lightning.readthedocs.io/PLUGINS.html#htlc-accepted</A>) for more.

Regards,
ZmnSCPxj

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; I was just playing around with LND and established a channel between 2 parties A and B. When sending a payment to B via HTLC, B adds an invoice and over here I used a different payment hash for A for sendpayment with a delta of 144 blocks. The error I got on initiating send payment is &quot;incorrect or unknown payment details&quot;. So what is exactly happening here? Is B ignoring any formation of HTLC between them?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A and B form an HTLC in them, to the point that it is &quot;irrevocably committed&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is a recommendation of BOLT spec that you pretty much do not do anything until an incoming HTLC reaches &quot;irrevocably committed&quot; state.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then, B looks at the HTLC data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If B knows the preimage to the payment hash, it claims the HTLC immediately as soon as it is irrevocably committed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If B does not know the preimage, it checks if there is forwarding data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there is no forwarding data (B is the final hop) then B responds with &quot;incorrect or unknown payment details&quot;, then A waits for the channel state to advance so that the HTLC getting removed reaches &quot;irrevocably committed&quot;, then reports the failure to the user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I hope in this case no money gets locked in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Money got locked temporarily int the HTLC, but was freed very soon afterwards, as fast as B and A can advance the channel state (which is limited by your hardware and network speeds).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Then how can one mimic griefing attack scenario (B refusing to release the correct preimage) in LND?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You may need to modify LND code directly, or ask LND devs if there are any such hooks available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In C-Lightning, you will have to install a plugin, devise some way for the plugin to know of what payment hash you want to grief, then have the plugin hook into `htlc_accepted`.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In `htlc_accepted` handler, if the incoming HTLC has a payment hash matching what you want to grief, you then perform a `waitblockheight` command to wait for the target block height you want to grief for, then return from the `htlc_accepted` handler.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (This can be complicated by the exact language you use to implement the plugin, remember the plugin should be async so it should still respond with `{&quot;result&quot;:&quot;continue&quot;}` immediately to other incoming `htlc_accepted` as normal, if you implement the plugin in Python the Python C-Lightning plugin library should &quot;just work&quot; as far as I know as it transforms the Python into an async language, but ask cdecker for that; but if you have a sufficiently monadic framework for asynchronicity (a la Javascript `Promise`/Haskell `IO`) it should work like that.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ZmnSCPxj

</I>&gt;<i> Yours sincerely,
