<PRE>Thanks ZmnSCPxj. Just a clarification on the idea proposed so that means
here B needs to delay the HTLC acceptance?  Pardon my knowledge on
c-lightning, but what exactly happens upon htlc_acceptance? Release of
preimage or just an acknowledgment by B reaching to the point of
irrevocably committed?

&gt;<i> Good morning Subhra,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     I was just playing around with LND and established a channel between
</I>&gt;<i> 2 parties A and B. When sending a payment to B via HTLC, B adds an invoice
</I>&gt;<i> and over here I used a different payment hash for A for sendpayment with a
</I>&gt;<i> delta of 144 blocks. The error I got on initiating send payment is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;incorrect or unknown payment details&quot;. So what is exactly happening here?
</I>&gt;<i> Is B ignoring any formation of HTLC between them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A and B form an HTLC in them, to the point that it is &quot;irrevocably
</I>&gt;<i> committed&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a recommendation of BOLT spec that you pretty much do not do
</I>&gt;<i> anything until an incoming HTLC reaches &quot;irrevocably committed&quot; state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, B looks at the HTLC data.
</I>&gt;<i> If B knows the preimage to the payment hash, it claims the HTLC
</I>&gt;<i> immediately as soon as it is irrevocably committed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If B does not know the preimage, it checks if there is forwarding data.
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no forwarding data (B is the final hop) then B responds with
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;incorrect or unknown payment details&quot;, then A waits for the channel state
</I>&gt;<i> to advance so that the HTLC getting removed reaches &quot;irrevocably
</I>&gt;<i> committed&quot;, then reports the failure to the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope in this case no money gets locked in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Money got locked temporarily int the HTLC, but was freed very soon
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards, as fast as B and A can advance the channel state (which is
</I>&gt;<i> limited by your hardware and network speeds).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then how can one mimic griefing attack scenario (B refusing to release
</I>&gt;<i> the correct preimage) in LND?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may need to modify LND code directly, or ask LND devs if there are any
</I>&gt;<i> such hooks available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In C-Lightning, you will have to install a plugin, devise some way for the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin to know of what payment hash you want to grief, then have the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> hook into `htlc_accepted`.
</I>&gt;<i> In `htlc_accepted` handler, if the incoming HTLC has a payment hash
</I>&gt;<i> matching what you want to grief, you then perform a `waitblockheight`
</I>&gt;<i> command to wait for the target block height you want to grief for, then
</I>&gt;<i> return from the `htlc_accepted` handler.
</I>&gt;<i> (This can be complicated by the exact language you use to implement the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin, remember the plugin should be async so it should still respond with
</I>&gt;<i> `{&quot;result&quot;:&quot;continue&quot;}` immediately to other incoming `htlc_accepted` as
</I>&gt;<i> normal, if you implement the plugin in Python the Python C-Lightning plugin
</I>&gt;<i> library should &quot;just work&quot; as far as I know as it transforms the Python
</I>&gt;<i> into an async language, but ask cdecker for that; but if you have a
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently monadic framework for asynchronicity (a la Javascript
</I>&gt;<i> `Promise`/Haskell `IO`) it should work like that.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> ZmnSCPxj
</I>&gt;<i>
