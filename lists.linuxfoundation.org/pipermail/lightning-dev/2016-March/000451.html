Yes, with SIGHASH_NOINPUT you only need to send timeout/rval per new
HTLC, plus new revocation preimage per new commit tx.  Assuming no
batching, so every second new commit tx adds a new HTLC, that's (4 + 32)
/ 2 + 32 = 50 bytes per commit tx.

Without SIGHASH_NOINPUT, add 64 bytes per commit tx output
(2+&lt;num-htlcs&gt;), plus you have to generate those signatures.  That's
probably going to be less than 1 TCP packet, though.

I'm not convinced it's qualitatively different.

Thanks for the reminder, re-reading... the result was that all the
clever tricks don't win much; you can avoid sending/storing the 4 byte
timeout.

&gt;<i> Note that with segwit, having a visible scriptPubKey so that R is
</I>&gt;<i> trivially obvious isn't even possible anymore...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (If by &quot;multiple-choice p2sh&quot; you mean merkelized abstract syntax trees
</I>&gt;<i> that would let you exchange 20+4 / 32+4 bytes of R+timeout for 32 bytes

</I>&gt;<i> I think you'd have to have a new double-length script hash type; which

</I>
No, MAST doesn't do it for you, since you still need the hash of the
unknown part.  We'd need a &quot;script is one of these hashes&quot; form, which
as you point out, bloats the UTXO set.

So not likely to be acceptable until lightning is the main bitcoin user.

Cheers,
Rusty.
