&gt;<i> Only mitigates it such that you can't do for free, and it adds some

</I>
No, not filtered the same R value, filtered on the bitwise identical
onion routing information (the origin would generate a fresh onion for
every payment, independent of R value).  The malicious node can't
manipulate the routing onion, or it won't decode.

(You can actually just save the authentication tag I think, for
comparison).

&gt;<i> For now I start with
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MAX_HOPS * MAX_OVERLAY * MIN_TIMEOUT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where MAX_OVERLAY is some 'consensus' value of how much buffer time each
</I>&gt;<i> node should deduct from the refund time at most. That way each node can
</I>&gt;<i> use the full range to randomize the refund time, without running out of
</I>&gt;<i> time in the end. I do not see how a pattern should emerge from that though.
</I>
If A sends many HTLCs through B, B can simply plot what the timeouts
are and know that A is likely originating the HTLCs rather than relaying
them for someone else.

I can't come up a scheme which combats this kind of analysis, but there
are cleverer people than me on this list...

&gt;<i> However, I am inclined to use those timestamps in the onion object, as
</I>&gt;<i> the described attackvector still exists.
</I>
Doesn't including timestamps in the onion provide explicit information
on the number of previous hops though?

Thanks,
Rusty.
