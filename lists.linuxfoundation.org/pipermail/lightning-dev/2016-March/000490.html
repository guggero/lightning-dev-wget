</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, right. If all payments that come from A have a timeout larger than

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if we take into account that the amount of nodes in the route

Good point. But we still lose on the receiving side; if you ever see a
small timeout you know the next hop is the final one.

I imagine we'll be spending some time getting more sophisticated with
our value cloaking as attacks emerge, but I'm happy to start with
something reasonable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, I am inclined to use those timestamps in the onion object, as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the described attackvector still exists.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doesn't including timestamps in the onion provide explicit information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the number of previous hops though?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not if they are randomized. The initial sender will choose a good
</I>&gt;<i> starting value (see above), and deduct MIN_TIMEOUT * MIN_OVERLAY *
</I>&gt;<i> RANDOM from it. Actually it doesn't provide any additional data, as that
</I>&gt;<i> is the very same mechanism the intermediate hops come to that value.
</I>
OK, let me get the proposal straight:

1.  Each node will publish its MIN_TIMEOUT (along
    with its other info as per Option 2 in
    <A HREF="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-October/000262.html">http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-October/000262.html</A> )

2.  The payer sums the MIN_TIMEOUT to the payee, adds some random value
    (keeping it under the max value allowed by protocol) to give the
    initial HTLC timeout.

3.  The payer puts the 'expected_timeout' in each layer of the onion, by
    subtracting the last hops' MIN_TIMEOUT from the initial timeout.

eg.  Say maximum allowed timeout is 20 * 12 hours, and route is:

        A (12 hours) -&gt; B (6 hours) -&gt; C (6 hours) -&gt; D (4 hours)

     Initial timeout has to be at least 12 + 6 + 6 + 4 == 28 hours, plus
     some padding for transmission delays, say 29 hours.

     It picks a random timeout between 29 and 240 hours, say now+100 hours,
     and onion looks like:

     [ A: now+100 [ B: now+88 [ C: now+82 [ D: now+76 ] ] ] ]

Have I missed anything?

Rusty.
