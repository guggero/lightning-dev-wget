<PRE>&gt;<i> I think the layout is a bit too nested (which makes sense coming from
</I>&gt;<i> the Java implementor, I guess? :) and I think it'd be good to have a
</I>&gt;<i> simple way to decide how to move ideas into/through the repo, without
</I>&gt;<i> making it a place where there's any point trying to politicise proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> (It's kind of telling that something's wrong when even matsjj hasn't
</I>&gt;<i> been able to get his pull requests accepted :)

Hehe I was waiting for you guys to merge those, as I don&#8217;t consider this &#8216;my repository&#8217; but rather the specification of the protocol eventually.
I do agree that the format isn&#8217;t perfect yet. I still like these nested packages, because it separates the different parts of the application (and I don&#8217;t see why plain numbers are any better than an actual structure? ;) ).
When I started the repository, my goal was to
(1) bring together all the different implementations
(2) agree on a common denominator.

We have to finish (1) first before we actually can concentrate on (2) though.

I suppose it makes sense to have the different parts of the application and have the different implementations side-by-side within that package. Then we can decide how we compose the &#8216;final&#8217; specifications of that part.

While we still work on the very 1.0 specifications, isn&#8217;t it favourable to stick to named proposals, instead of throwing around with numbers? (even though I like the &#8220;BOLT&#8221; names&#8230;)

Cheers
