&gt;<i> Hi Guys!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wanna make a improvement proposal for the Lightning Network and would 
</I>&gt;<i> like to hear your thoughts about it.
</I>
Hi Sam!

        Welcome to the list!

&gt;<i> I am calling it: Decentralized Service Provider (DSP).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A Decentralized Service Provider (DSP) could grant end users access to 
</I>&gt;<i> the Ligthning Network, so they wouldn't have to validate
</I>&gt;<i> the Blockchain or care about closing times of channels.
</I>
It's an interesting idea; Lightning As A Service :)

&gt;<i> Also end users 
</I>&gt;<i> would enjoy the benefit of propably much larger
</I>&gt;<i> (filled with more Bitcoins) channels which allows them to send and 
</I>&gt;<i> receive more money, since all users of one DSP would share their channel(s).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each DSP consists of several entities (propbly also geographically 
</I>&gt;<i> distributed).
</I>&gt;<i> These entities manage the DSP's tasks in a collaborative way.
</I>&gt;<i> These Tasks are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Managing Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Managing the Lightning Network Channel(s)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Managing communication with end users and the Lightning Network
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Deposit addresses for the DSP are multi-sig addresses, so that a 
</I>&gt;<i> majority of a DSP's entities is required to sign withdrawals.
</I>&gt;<i> Also the Lightning Network channels are managed in this multi-sig 
</I>&gt;<i> style   .....erm.....  yes i am aware that Lightning Network channels
</I>&gt;<i> are multig-sig anyway, what i wanted to say is: a update to the channel 
</I>&gt;<i> reqiures now a majority of the DSP's entities to singn AND
</I>&gt;<i> the other side of that channel to sign. In case both sides of the 
</I>&gt;<i> Lighting Network channel are DSPs the majority of both DSP's entities 
</I>&gt;<i> need to sign.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Due to this multi-sig construction a single entity of a DSP couldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> steal the end users Bitcoins. It would actually reqire the majority of 
</I>&gt;<i> entities of
</I>&gt;<i> one DSP to collaborate to steal the end users money.
</I>
This is better than the current web-wallet model where only one party is
required to steal everything :)

&gt;<i> DSP's entities communicate with signed messages with their end users and 
</I>&gt;<i> with each other, so everything is provable. Whenever some entity of a DSP
</I>&gt;<i> is acting malicious the other entities of that DSP can decide to exclude 
</I>&gt;<i> this entity from this DSP by transferring control of the managed 
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoins and
</I>&gt;<i> channels to some new multi-sig address(es)/channel(s) that doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> require the malicous acting entity's signature.
</I>&gt;<i> This could also be done if one entity isn't reliable available.
</I>
It's actually tricky to design this system to be robust.  But I look
forward to seeing someone try!

&gt;<i> Another advantage of DSP's would be that fewer channels are reqired, 
</I>&gt;<i> since not every end user needs his own channel. Thus DSPs could save even
</I>&gt;<i> more space on the Blockchain than Lightning alone.
</I>
It might shrink the UTXO set, but you still need to transfer bitcoins
in of course.

Cheers,
Rusty.
