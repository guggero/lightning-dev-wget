<PRE>Hi Nicolas,

Yes, I do think exploring using signatures as a method of revocation is
interesting! For revoking Commitments, I believe if you did disclosure
of the private-key as a method of revocation, then it's possible to
achieve this compactness without using OP_CODESEPARATOR.

Side note: It's necessary to disclose temporary private keys (instead of
signatures) under this mechanism, since it's possible to compactly store
the keys by making it derived from a tree or chain of hash functions.

A compact revocable example for Bob to broadcast could be:
&lt;PubkeyAlice&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
OP_NOTIF
	&lt;CSVDelay&gt; OP_DROP OP_CSV 
OP_ENDIF
&lt;PubkeyBob&gt;
OP_CHECKSIG

On the other hand, if Alice broadcasted it, her script could be:
&lt;PubkeyBob&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
OP_NOTIF
	&lt;CSVDelay&gt; OP_DROP OP_CSV 
OP_ENDIF
&lt;PubkeyAlice&gt;
OP_CHECKSIG

Alice successful redemption of her broadcast would be:
(after one week)
&lt;AliceSig&gt; &lt;0&gt;

Bob's penalty transaction on Alice's broadcast would be:
&lt;AliceSig&gt; &lt;BobSig&gt;

If Alice did not broadcast the correct Commitment, Bob can take the
money immediately because she disclosed her private key when creating
the new Commitment transaction, so Bob has both PrivkeyBob and
PrivkeyAlice. If Alice correctly broadcast the most recent Commitment,
Bob does not have PrivkeyAlice so he cannot take the funds, but Alice
does not have PrivkeyBob so she has to wait for the CSV delay.

If the goal is to save space, it saves a little in the
timeout/non-penalty case, but the transactions are larger for penalty
cases (although they may be less frequent).

It's also possible to make it just a multisig output with the child
transaction spending from it pre-signed as well using nSequence, but
that requires more storage and more on-chain transactions (while saving
in the script output size), this design is not necessary for this
particular instance if there's OP_CSV.

As a side note, OP_CODESEPARATOR may become useful if there is
SIGHASH_NOINPUT inside segregated witness in the future, by being able
to have one signature be able to apply towards multiple types of
transactions (e.g. different redeemScript/scriptPubKey r-values or
pubkeys).
