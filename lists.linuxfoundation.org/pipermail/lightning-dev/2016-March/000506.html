<PRE>Hi all!

        Pierre queried the placement of acknowlegements in BOLT #2; I
share his concerns, but wanted to document them here too.

        The current draft (which I've implemented, and seems to work as
of yesterday) has a header with an &quot;acknowledge&quot; field:

(BOLT-encryption):
* `acknowledge`: an 8-byte little-endian field indicating the number of non-`authenticate` messages received and processed so far.

This is used so we know what the other side has received when they send
an &quot;update_commit&quot; message, and so we know where to restart the
conversation after reconnect (&quot;authenticate&quot; message).

The current spec requires that acks never go backwards, meaning in
practice an implementation needs to write to disk persistently before
*every* new packet sent.

If we move the &quot;ack&quot; back into the update_commit/authenticatate messages
(I had this originally), I think we can have the spec say that on
reconnect you retransmit from previous received update_revocation.  And
fee updates should Just Work too.  There's also an implied &quot;ack&quot; in the
update_revocation message (which has to correspond to the
update_commit).  One will need to be added to the &quot;authenticate&quot;
message, too, which is used for connection re-establishment.

It's not a big code change: it's logically implemented as callbacks when
a packet is acked.  That just means they'll just fire all at once when
we receive a update_commit / update_revocation packet...

I'll now try implementing that, and report back if I've missed anything
:<i>)
</I>
Cheers,
Rusty.
